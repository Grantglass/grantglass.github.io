LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 




LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 


AS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though 
of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled fim 
-lull: he got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived 
Twards at York; from whence he had married my mother, whose relations 
e named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom 
as called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in 
rland, we are now called— nay, we call ourselves, and write our name— 
isoe; and so my companions always called me. 

had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English 
iment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel 
rkhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards, 
lat became of my second brother 1 never knew, any more than my father 
mother did know what was become of me. 

Icing the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head began 
be filled very early with rambling thoughts; my father, who was very 
ient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-education 
a countrjr free-school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I 
aid be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this 
me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and 
inst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, 
c there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending 
jctly to the life of misery which was to befall me. 

ly father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel 
inst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his 
mber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly 
me upon this subject: he asked me what reasons, more than a mere 
[idering inclination, I had for leaving my father’s house and my native 
intry, where 1 might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my 
line by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told 
it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior 
unes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enter- 
and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the 
amon road; and these things were all either too far above me, or too far 
bw me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper 
ton of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best 
j in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to die 
tries and hardships, the labor and sufferings of the mechanic part of man- 
and not embarrassed with the pride, luxuiy, ambidon, and envy of 
lupper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness ot this 
1 oy this one thing, viz.: that this was the state of life which all othc^ 
pie envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


of ^being bom to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle 
of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man 
gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to 
have neither poverty nor riches. 

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities ‘of life 
were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind; but that the middle 
station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes 
as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so 
many distempers, and uneasiness, either of body or mind, as those were who, 
by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on one hand, or by hard labor, 
want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring 
distempers upon themselves by the natural consequences of their w^ of living; 
that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of viri^es and aU 
kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle 
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable 
diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle 
station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the 
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labors of the 
hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed 
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body of 
rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambi- 
tion for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the 
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling 
that they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to know it more 
sensibly. 


After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, 
not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which 
nature, and the station of life I was bom in seemed to have provided against; 
that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well 
for me, and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had 
just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy 
m the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that 
he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in 
warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a 
word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and 
se^e at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my 
i^formnes, as to give me any encouragement to go away; and to close aH 
he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the 
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, 
but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, 
where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray fori 
me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step God! 
would not bless me, and 1 should have leisui-e hereafter to reflect upon having 
n^l^ted his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. 

discourse, which was truly prophetic, 
thop^ I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE ^ ^ 

the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke trf.*iny i 
bro^htr who was killed; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to re;^t, 
ancT niDne to assist me, he was so moved tfiat he broke off the discourse^ and 
told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could be other- 
wise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at 
home according to my father’s desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; 
and, in short, to prevent any of my father’s further importunities, in a few 
weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did not act 
quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted, but I took my 
mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and 
told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that 
I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it, 
and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; 
that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a 
trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out 
my time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go one 
voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more; 
and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time that I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be 
to no pikpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew 
too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for 
my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after 
the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender expressions 
as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin 
myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I should never have 
their consent to it; that for her part, she would not have so much hand in 
my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing 
when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to name it to my father, yet I heard afterwards 
that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing 
a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might be happy if 
he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable 
wretch that ever was bom: I can give no consent to it.” 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in the 
mean time, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, 
and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so 
positiv^ely determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. 
But being one day at Hull, whither I went casually, and without any purpose 
of making an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one of my 
companions being going by sea to London in his father’s ship, and promptii^ 
me to go with them, with the common allurement of a seafaring man, that 
it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother 
any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear 
of it as they might, without asking God’s blessing or my father’s, without 



6 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill liour, God 
^ knows, on the ist of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for 
hmdoTL Never any young adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner 
or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner got out of the Humber, 
than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; 
and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, 
and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, 
and how justly I was overtaken by the ju^ment of Heaven for my wicked 
leaving my father’s house, and abandoning my duty. All the good counsels 
of my parents, my father’s tears and my mother’s entreaties, came now fresh 
into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch 
of hardness to which it has come since, reproached me with the contempt 
of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father. \ 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though 
nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few 
days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, 
and had never known anything of the matter. I expected every wave would 
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it 
did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more: in this 
agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please 
God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon 
dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it 
into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run 
myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness 
of his observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably 
he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or 
troubles on shore; and, in short, I resolved that I would, like a true repenting 
prodigal, go home to my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, and 
indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea 
calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for 
all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather 
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; 
the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having 
little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, 
as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very 
cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible 
the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. 
And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who 
had enticed me away, comes to me: “Well, Bob,” says he, clapping me upon 
the shoulder, how do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer’n’t 
you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?” “A capful d’you call it?” 
said I; twas a terrible storm. A storm, you fool you,” replies he: “do you 
caU that a storm? why, it was nothing at aU; give us but a good ship and 
sea-room, and we thmk nothing of such a squaU of wind as that; but you’re

but a fresh-water sailor, Bob, Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we’ll 
forget all that; d’ye see what charming weather ’tis now?” To make short this 
sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made, and 
I was made half drunk with it; and in that one night’s wickedness I drowned 
all ihy repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions 
for the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface 
and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my 
thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by 
the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I 
entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I found, 
indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, 
endeavor to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself 
from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and 
company, soon mastered the return of those fits— for so I called them; and 
I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over my conscience as any 
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was 
to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it 
does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take 
this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most 
hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of. 

The ^xth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind 
having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had made but little way 
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, 
the wind continuing contrary, viz.: at the south-west, for seven or eight days, 
during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same 
roads, as the common harbor where the ships might wait for a wind for 
the river. 

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have tided it up 
the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four or 
five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good as a 
harbor, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were 
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time 
in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the morn- 
ing, the wind increased, and we had ail hands at work to strike our top-masts, 
and make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as 
possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle 
in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come 
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode 
with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see terror 
and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The master, though 
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went m and out of 
his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say several times, “Lord, 
be merciful to us! we shall be all lost; we shall be all undone!” and the like. 
During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in 
the steerage, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first 



8 


WORKS OF DANEL DEFOE 

penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself 
against: 1 thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would 
be nothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said 
just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted. 1 got 
up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never ♦^aw: 
the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; 
when I could look about, 1 could see nothing but distress round us; two 
ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being 
deep laden; and our men cried out, that a ship which rode about a mile 
ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, 
were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast 
standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much laboring in the sea; 
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with 
only their spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship 
to let them cut away the foremast, which he was very unwilUng to do; but 
the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship would founder, 
he consented; and when they had cut away the foremast, the main-mast stood 
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut that away 
also, and make a clear deck. 

And one must judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was 
but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little. 
But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, 
I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, 
and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken 
at first, than I was at death itself! and these, added to the terror of the storm, 
put me into such a condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the worst 
was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen them- 
selves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, but 
she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now 
and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage in one respect 
diat I did not know what they meant by founder, till I inquired. However, 
the storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the 
boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and 
expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle 
of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had 
been down to see, cried out we had sprung a leak; another said, there was 
four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that 
word, my heart, as I thought, died within me; and I fell backwards upon the 
side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, 
and told me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
pump as another; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and worked 
very heartily. While this was doing, the master, seeing some light colliers, 
who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip, and run away to 
; the sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 9 

I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some 
dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in 
a swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of, 
nobody minded me, or what was become of me;, but another man stepped 
to th^ pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had 
been dead: and it was a great while before I came to myself. 

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that 
the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as 
it was not possible she could swim till we might run into any port, so the 
master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out 
just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost 
hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, 
or for the boat to lie near the ship’s side, till at last the men rowing very , 
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope 
over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which 
they, after much labor and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close 
under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them 
or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; 
so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much 
as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon 
shore, be would make it good to their master; so partly rowing and partly 
driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore 
almost as far as Winterton Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we 
saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a 
ship foundering in the sea, 1 must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up 
when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment that they 
rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in, my heart was, 
as it were, dead witliin me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind, 
and the thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition,— the men yet laboring at the oar to bring 
the boat near the shore,— we could see (when our boat mounting the waves, 
we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along the strand, 
to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow way towards 
the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till, being past the lighthouse 
at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so 
the land broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, 
though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked after- 
wards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with 
great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us 
good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money 
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we 
diought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, 
I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour’s parable, had even 



10 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

killed" the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was casi 
away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurance! 
that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing coulc 
resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason, and my more 
composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know noi 
what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overmling decree, that hur- 
ries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it b( 
before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing 
but some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was (impossible for 
to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and 
persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two sdph visible instruc- 
tions as 1 had met with in my first attempt. \ 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, ahd who was the 
master’s son, was now less forward than I. The first time he ^oke to me aftei 
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were 
separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it 
appeared his tone was altered; and looking very melancholy, and shaking his 
head, he asked me how I did, and telling his father who 1 was, and how 1 had 
come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther abroad: his father, 
turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone, “Young man,” says he, 
“you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain 
and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man.” “Why, sir,” said 1, 
“wall you go to sea no more!” “That is another case,” said he; “it is my calling, 
and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what 
a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Per- 
haps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. 
Pray,” continues he, “what are you? and on what account did you go to sear" 
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out into 
a strange kind of passion: “What had I done,” says he, “that such an unhappy 
wretch should come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship 
with thee again for a thousand pounds.” This indeed was, as I said, an excur- 
sion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was 
farther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterwards talkec 
very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt 
Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against 
me. “And, young man,” said he, “depend upon it, if you do not go back 
wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappoint* 
ments, till your father’s words are fulfilled tfpon you.” 

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no more; 
which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some money in my pocket 
I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the road, haa manj 
stn^gles with myself, what course of life I should take, and whether I shouk 
go home or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to 
thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at amon|

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

the neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, 
but even everybody else; from whence I have since often observed, how 
incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially of 
youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases, viz.: that they 
are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the 
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of 
the returning, which only can make them be esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what measures 
to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued 
to going home; and as I staid a while, the remembrance of the distress I had 
been in wore off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to 
remrn wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and 
looked out for a voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away from my father’s house,— 
which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, 
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf 
to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the commands of my father, 
—I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate 
of all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to the 
coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly called it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship myself 
as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked a little harder than 
[ordinary, yet at the same time I should have learned the duty and office of a 

i oremast man, and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, 
f not for a master. But as it was always my fate to choose for the worse, 
0 1 did here; for having money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my 
►ack, I would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither 
lad any business in the ship, nor learned to do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London, 
which does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows 
(IS I then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them 
irery early; but it was not so with me. I first got acquainted with the master 
pf a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very 
[ood success there, was resolved to go again. This captain, taking a fancy 
o my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing 
ne say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with 
urn I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate and his companion; 
nd if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it 
lat the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some encour- 
gement. 

I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this captain, 
i^ho was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and 
arried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of 
ly friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about £40 in 
ich toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. These £40 1 had 
iustered together by the assistance of some of my relations whom I corre- 



12 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

sponded with; and who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to 
contribute so much as that to my" fi^t adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my adven- 
tures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain; 
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the 
rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ship s course, take 
an observation, and, in short, to understand some things that were needful 
to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took 
delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a 
merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my 
adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost £360; and this 
filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly; that I was 
continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat 
of the climate; our principal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude 
of fifteen degrees north even to the line itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great mis- 
fortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, 
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former 
voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest 
voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite £100 of my 
new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, which I had lodged with my 
friend’s widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes: 
the first was this— our ship, making her course towards the Canary Islands, 
or rather between those Islands and the African shore, was surprised in the 
gray of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us 
with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvas as our 
yards would spread, or our masts carry, to get clear; but finding the pirate 
gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we 
prepared to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About 
three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just 
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought 
eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, 
which made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring in 
also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on board. 
However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared 
to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on board the 
next time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, 
who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied 
them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our 
deck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, 
our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight wounded, wc 
were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belong- 
jx^to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended; nor was 
I carried up the country to the emperor’s court, as the rest of our men were, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 13 

but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prijfce, and made his 
slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his ousiness. At this surprising 
change of my circumstances, from a. merchant to a miserable slave, I was 
perfectly overwhelmed; and now 1 looked back upon my father’s prophetic 
discourse to me, that I should be miserable and have none to relieve me, 
which 1 thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could not be 
worse; for now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone 
without redemption; but, alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go 
through, as will appear in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was 
in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again, believing 
that It would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or 
Portuguese man-of-war, and that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope 
of mine was soon taken away, for when he went to sea, he left me on shore 
to look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves about 
his house; and when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to 
lie in the cabin to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to 
effect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it; nothing pre- 
sented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate 
it to that would embark with me— no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, 
or Scotsman, there but myself; so that for two years, though 1 often pleased 
myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect 
or putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put the 
old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head. My 
patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship, whicn, 
as I heard, was for want of money, he used, constantly, once or twice a week, 
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship’s pinnace, and go 
out into the road a-fishing; and as he always took me and the young Maresco 
with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dexter- 
ous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, 
one of his kinsmen, and the youth— the Maresco, as they called him— to catch 
a dish of fish for him. 

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a fog rose 
, so thick that, though wc were not half a league from the shore, we lost sight 
of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we labored all day, 
and all the next night; and when the morning came, we found we had pulled 
[ off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were at least two 
leagues from the shore. However, we got well in again, though with a great 
deal of labor and some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in 
the morning; but we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of him- 
self for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our English ship 
that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without 
& compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who 



j4 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

also was an English slave, to build a little ^te-room, or cabin, in the middlt 
of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to 
steer, and naul home the main-sheet: and room before for a hand or two 
to st^d and work the sails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-iputton 
sail; and the boom gibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and 
low, and had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to 
eat on, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as ht 
thought fit to drink, and his bread, rice, and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as was most dexter- 
ous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It lhappened that he 
had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or tfor fish, with two 
or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for \^om he had pro- 
vided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board th^ boat over-night 
a larger store of provisions than ordina^; and had ordered )me to get readj 
three fusees with powder and shot, which were on board his ship, for that 
they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning with 
the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and everything to 
accommodate his guests; when by and by my patron came on board alone, 
and told me his guests had put off going, from some business that fell out, 
and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat 
and catch some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house; and com- 
manded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it home to his house; 
all which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts, 
for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and tnj 
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing business, 
but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, 
whither I should steer, —anywhere to get out of that place was my desire. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to gel 
something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not pres 
to eat or our patron’s bread. He said that was true; so he brought a 1 ^ 
basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh water, into the boat. I kne’^ 
where my patron’s case of bottles stood, which it was evident, by the makej 
were taken out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into the 
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for our ma 
I conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed at 
half a hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a sav| 
and a hammer, aD of which were of great ifse to us afterwards, especially d 
wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocend 
came into also: his name was Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely; so 1 
called to him: “Moely,” said I, “our patron’s guns are on board the boatj 
can you get a little powder and shot? It may be we may kill some alcami 
(a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunne 
stores io the ship.” “Yes,” says he, “111 bring some;” and accordingly he oroug 
a gteat leaiher pouch, which held a pound and a half of powder, or rat 



ROBINSON C31XJSOE IS 

more; and another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some tmBeis, 
and pnt all into the boat* At the same time, I had found some powder of my 
master’s in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the 
pasc, which was almost empty, pourk^ what was in it into another; and thus 
urnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to fish* The 
castle, which is at the entrance of the po^ knew who we were, and took no 
aotice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled 
n our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind blew from the N, N, E., which 
a^as contrary to mv desire, for had k blown southerly, I had been sure to have 
nade the coast of Spain, and at least reached to tne Bay of Cadiz; but my 
^solutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid 
dace where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, —for when I had fiidt 
m my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them,— I said 
b the Moor, ‘This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we must 
tand farther off.” He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the head of the 
loat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm, I run the boat out near a league 
arthcr, and then brought her to as if 1 would fish; when, giving the boy the 
elm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped 
something behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm under his 
1st, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, 
he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in, told me 
would go all over the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat, 
t he would have reached me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon 
ich 1 stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I 
isented it at him, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would 

S iiet I would do him none. “But,” said I, “you swim well enough to reach 
e shore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I 
1 do you no harm; but if you come near the boat, Til shoot you ffurou^ 
head, for I am resolved to have my liberty”: so he turned himself about, 

1 swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with case, 
he was an excellent swimmer. 

could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have 
>wned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was 
ne, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, “Xury, 
yovL will be faithful to me, I’ll make you a great man; but if you will not 
oke your face to be true to me,”— that is, swear by Mahomet and his 
her’s beard,— “I must throw you into the sea too.” The boy smiled in my 
fe, and spoke so innocently, that I could not distrust him, and swore to be 
thful to me, and go all over the world with me. 

Vhael was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly^ 
sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might think me 
le towards the strait’s mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their 
s must have been supposed to do): for who would have supposed we were 
on to the southward to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations 
Negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes, and destroy us; where 



womss OF 

wk, could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage feeaste, c 
more mercUess savages of human kind? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and stecre 
directly south and by east, bending my course a little towards the east, that 
might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and 
smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day at due 
o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less tha 
one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor c 
Morocco’s dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we sa) 
no people. j 

Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, anaj the dreadful appre 
hensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would |not stop, or go o 
shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair tillll had sailed in tha 
manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I conclude 
also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they al^ would now giv 
over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to Wn anchor in thi 
mouth of a little river, I knew not what, nor where; neither what latitude 
what country, what nation, or what river. I neither saw, nor desired to se 
any people; the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into thi 
creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, am 
discover the country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadfv 
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knev 
not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged o 
me not to go on shore till day. “Well, Xury,” said I, “then I won’t; but i 
may be we may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions, 
“Tnen we give them the shoot gun,” says Xury, laughing; “make them ru 
wey.” Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. Howevei 
I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out of on 
patron’s case of bottles) to cheer him up. After all, Xury’s advice was gooi 
and I took it: we dropped our litde anchor, and lay still all night; I say sdl 
for we slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (v 
knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shoP 
and run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure ( 
cooling themselves; and they made such hideous bowlings and yellmgs, that 
never indeed heard the like.> 

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and so was I too; but we were both moi 
frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimiuii 
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his bloti 
ing to be a monstrous huge and furious 4>east. Xury said it was a lion, and 
.might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh tl 
^chor and row away. “No,” says I, “Xu^; we can slip our cable, ^:h il 
buoy to It, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us far.’’ I had no socmer ^ 
SP; but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within two oars’ Icn{( 
/which somed^g surprised me; however, 1 immediately stepped to the caM 
<mr, and takmg up my gun, fired at him; upon which he immediately tun* 
$bout, jauipvawam towards the shore again. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE M'' 

Bttt k is impossible to describe tbe horrid noises^ ai^ hideous cries and 
owlkigs, that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher 
rkhm the country, upon the noise or report of the mn-^a th^ I have some 
jason to believe those creatures had never heard before:-*this convinced ^ 
lat Acre was no ^oing on shore for us in the night on that coast, and how to 
enture on shore in the day was another question too; for to have fallen into 
jc hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands 
f the lions and tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it. 
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other 
ir water, for we had not a pint left iti the boat; when or where to get k 
ras the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one the 
irs, he would find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked hinci 
rhy he would go; whv I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The boy 
nswered with so much affection, as made me love liim ever after. he» 
[f wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey.” “Well, Xury,” said I, 
rill both go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat 
[either of us.” So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out 
F our patron’s case of bottles which I mentioned before; and we hauled the 
pat in as near the shore as we thought was proper, and so waded on shore, 
■ying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water, 
aid not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of canoes 
1 savages down the river; but the bov, seeing a low place atout a mile

;t, and 1 ran towards him to help him; but when I came nearer to hkn, 
w something hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had 
c, like a hare, but different in color, and longer legs: however, we were 
/ glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury 
le with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans, 
ut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for 
tde higher up the creek where we were, we found the water fre^ when 
tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our jars, and 
ted on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having 
1 no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country. 
ls I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew verv wwl that die 
ids of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd Islands also, lay not far oS 
n the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an observation to know 
It latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing, or at least remembering. 
It latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or when tio 
id off to sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily have found some 
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this coast dll I came 
hat part where the English traded, 1 should find some of their vessels upcm 
ir usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in. 

►y the best of my calculadon, that place where I now was must be that 
i»try which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and 
Negroes, li^ waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes 



jg WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

havimr abandoned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moorsj and tl 
Moojre not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness; an 
indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers, lior 
leopards, and other furious creatures which harbor there; so that the Moo 
use Jt for their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three thoi 
sand men at a time: and, indeed, for ne^ a hundred miles together upon th 
coast, we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited country by day, and hear 
nothing but bowlings and roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the daytime, I thought I saw the Pi|:o of Teneriffe, beir 
the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; ^jand had a great mk 
to v^ture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but hav% tried twice, I wj 
forced in again by contrary winds, die sea also going t<|io high for my litt 
vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left th 
place, and once in particular, being early in the morning, we came to a 
anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the tic 
beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were moj 
about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that v 
had best go farther off the shore; “for,” says he, “look, yonder lies a dreadfi 
monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.” I looked where he pointei 
and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that la 
on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung i 
it were a little over him, “Xury,” says I, “you shall go on shore and kill hini 
Xury looked frighted, and said, “Me kill! he eat me at one mouth;” one moutf 
ful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie stil 
and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket bore, and loaded 
with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down; the 
I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we had three jpieces 
I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the fin 
piece to have shot him in the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a littl 
above his nose that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bom 
He started up, growling at first, but finding his leg broken, fell down agaii 
and then got up upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that eve 
1 beard. 1 was a little surprised that I bad not bit bim on tbe bead; boweve 
I took up the second piece immediately, and, though he began to move of 
fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him dro 
and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took bear 
and would have me let him go on shore.' “Well, go,” said I: so the boy jump 
into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with tl 
other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piec 
to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which despatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry I 
lose three chafes of powder and shot upon a creature that was good 
nothsi:^ to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he cofl^ 
utt board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. “For what, Xury?” said 
“Mo cut off his head,” said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head, M

a cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one. 

I bcdiought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him mi^t, one wav 
r other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his sWn if I coal4 

0 Xujy and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the better wcork- 
lan at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole 
ay, but at last we got off the hide, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, 
le sun effectually dried it in two days’ time, and it afterwards served me to 
e upon. 

Alter this we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days, 
ving very sparingly on our provisions, which began to abate very much, and 
oing no oftener to the shore than we were obliged for fresh water. My design 

1 this was to make the River Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere 
bout the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European 
[lip; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for 

} e islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships from 
irope, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to die East 
dies, made this cape, or those islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my 
rtune upon this single point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must 
Irish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have said, 
a^gan to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we 
[led by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us; we could also 
irceive they were quite black and naked, I was once inclined to have gone 
i shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, “No go, 
go.” However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and 
bund they ran along the shore by me a good way: I observed they had no 
:apons in their hands, except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury 
d was a lance, and that they could throw them a great way with good aim; 

I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and 
icularly made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me to stop my 
r, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this, I lowered the top of my 
and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half 
lour came back, and brought back two pieces of dry flesh and some com, 
i as is the produce of their country; but we neither knew what die one or 
other was: however, we were willhag to accept it; but how to come at it 
our next dispute, for I would not venture on shore to them, and they were 
nuch afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it 
the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off tm we 
:hed it on board, and then came close to us again. 

^e made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends; 
an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige than wonderfully: for 
le we were lying by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing 
other (as we took it) with great fury from the mountains towards die sea; 
ther it was the male pursuing the female, or whether they were in sport or 
age, we could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual 
“**ai^e, but I believe it was die latter; because, in the first place; those 



W08XS OF PANIEl. iMEk® 

x^enotB creatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in the second place 
we found the people terribly frighted, especially the women. The man tbal 
had the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the 
two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not offer to fall upon an) 
of the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they 
had come^for their diversion: at last one of them began to come nearer om 
boat than at first I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun 
with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as b« 
came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head: to 
mediately he sank down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and 
down, as iJf he was struggling for life, and so indeed he was: he immediately 
made to the shore; but between the wound, which was his mot^l hurt, and 
the strangling of the water, he died just before he reached the shwe. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the 
noise and fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to die fpr fear, and 
fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the creature dead, 
and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore, 
they took heart and came, and began to search for the creature. I found him 
by his blood staining the water; and by the help of a rope, which I slung round 
him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that 
it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the 
Negroes held up their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed 
him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun, 
swam on the shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they 
came; nor could 1, at that distance, know what it was. I found quickly the 
Negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them 
take it as a favor from me; which, when I made signs to them that they m^ht 
take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with 
him; and though they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they 
took off his slan as readily, and much more readily, than we could have done 
with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, pointing 
Out that I would give it them; but made signs for the skin, which they gave me 
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provisions. Which, 
though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them for 
some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, 
to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They called 
immediately to some of their friends, and there came two women, and brought 
a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I supposed, in the sun; this they set 
down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them 
^ three. The women were as naked as the men. , 

I was now furnished with roots and com, such as it was, and water; and 
leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days mota 
without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great lengtk 
mto the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues before me; and th^ 
sea being very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point. At teiph, doa--

bItag Ae point, at aboot two kagues from the land, I saw plainly land on Ac 
oAor side, to seaward: Aen I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that 
this was the Cape de Verd, and Aose Ae islands called, from thence, Cape de 
Verd Islands. However, Aey were at a great distance, and I could not well 
tell what I had best to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I 
might neither reach one or other. 

In Ais dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin, and sat down, 
Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out, ‘‘Master, master, 
a ship with a sail!” and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thihldug 
it must needs be some of his master^s ships sent to pursue us, but I knew we 
were far enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediatdy 
saw, not only Ae ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship; and as I thought, was 
bound to the coast of Guinea, for Negroes. But, when I observed the course 
she steered was soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not 
design to come any nearer to the shore: upon which I stretched out to sea as 
much I could, resolving to speak with them if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in their 
way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any signal to them: 
but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, 
saw, by the help of their glasses, that it was some European boat, which Aey 
supposed must belong to some ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let 
me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron’s ancient on 
board, I niade a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both 
which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they did not 
hear the gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for 
me; and in about three hours’ time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French, 
but I understood none of them; but at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on board, 
called to me: and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I 
had made my escape out of slavery from Ae Moors, at Sallee; they then bade 
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I was thus 
delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition 
as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of Ae Aip, as 
a return for my deliverance; but he generously told me, he would take noAing 
from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when I came to 
he Brazils. “For,” says he, “I have saved your life on no oAer terms than I 
vould be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my lot 
0 be taken up in the same condition. Besides,” said he, “when I carry you to 
he Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from you 
vhat you have, you will be starved Aere, and then I only take away that life 
have given. No, no,” says he; “Seignor Inglese” (Mr. Englishman), “I uriB 
arry you thither in charity, and those things wUl help to buy your suWstence 
here, and your passage home again.” 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the performance m 
^ fitde; for he ordered Ae seamen, that none should touch anything that 1 had: 



WORKS Of DANJEX, tMEFOE 

dien he took everything into his own possession, and gave me back an m 
inventory of them, that I might have them, even to my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me 1 
would buy it of me for his ship’s use; and asked me what I would have for

to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him: upon which he to 
me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it 
Brazil; and when it came there, if an)r one offered to give more, he wot 
make it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy X 
which I was loath to take; not that I was unwilling to let the captain have 
but I was very loath to sell the poor boy’s liberty, who (had assisted m 
faithfully in procuring my own. However, when I let him know my reaso 
he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that 'he would give 
boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned C^istian; upon 
and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captai|n have him. 

We had a very good vwage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the Bay de Tod 
los Santos, or All Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-two days afteA- And now I 
once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life; 
what to do next with myself I was to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough remembe 
he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for 
leopard’s skin, and forty for the lion’s skin, which I had in my boat, and cat 
everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me; and what I 
willing to sell, he bought of me; such as the case of bottles, two of my gun 
and a piece of the lump of beeswax,— for I had made candles of the rest; i 
word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my car 
and with this stock, I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the house of a goo 
honest man, like himself, who had an ingeniOy as they call it (that is, a pknd 
tion and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted mysd 
by that means, with the manner of planting and making of sugar; and seeiii 
how well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if 
could get a license to settle there, I would turn planter among them; resolvii^ 
in the mean time, to find out some way to get my money, which I had left 
London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturali2 
tion, I purchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reac 
and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might I 
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England. 

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English parents, wh 
name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. 1 call him 
neighbor, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on ver 
ciab^ together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather pli 
for rood than anything else, for about two years. However, we began t 
oieise, and our land began to come into order; so that the third year we

m bdForCt I had done wrong in parting widi my boy Xury, 

Jut, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great wonder* 
lad no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment quite remote 
my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for whidi 
orsook my father’s house, and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was 
ning into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which my 
her advised me to before, and which, if I resolved to go on with, I migtn: 
well have staid at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world, as 
lad done; and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well 
England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off to do it 
long strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never 
hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me. 

[n this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret, 
lad nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbor; no work to 
done, but by the labor of my hands; and I used to sav, I lived just like a 
in cast away upon some desolate island, that had noboqy there but himself* 
t how just has it been; and how should all men reflect, that when they com- 
he their present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may obli^ 
m to make the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity by th^ 
Lerience: I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary life f reflected 
[in an island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly 
mpared it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I hao, 
probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich, 

vas, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation, 
re my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went 
; for the ship remained there, in providing his lading, and preparing for 
oyage, nearly three months; when, telling him what little stock I had left 
tid me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice; “Seignor 
:se,” says he (for so he always called me), “if you will give me letters, and 
Dcuration in form to me, with orders to the person who has your money 
ondon, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, 
in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce 
lem, God willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are all subject 
Ganges and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one hundred 
ids sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run 
the first; so that, if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way; 
if it miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for your 
ily” 

Ms was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not but 
pnvinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared 
rs to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and a procaratkm 
le Portuguese captain, as he desired.

of his behavior, aitd wlmt cmiinm 1 was oow in* wi^ oth 
accessary directions for my supply; and when this honest captain came th Li 
bon, he found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send ovf 
not the order only, but a full account of my story to a merchant at Londo 
who represented it effectually to her; whereupon she not only delivered ti 
money, out, out of her own pocket, sent the Portugal captain a very handson 
present for his humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in Ei^lish goo( 
such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, ai 
he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without my dire 
tion (for I was too young in my business to think of j them), he had talc 
care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, n^feessary for my plani 
tion, and which were of great use to me. I 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes mad|, for I was surpris 
with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, "^ad laid out the 
pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for' himself, to purchi 
and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years* service, and woi 
not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would ha 
him accept, being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such 
cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the coc 
try, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that I might! 

I had more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infiniti 
beyond my poor neighbor— I mean in the advancement of my plantation; j 
the first thing I did, I bought me a Negro slave, and a European servant ah 
I mean another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our great 
adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with great success ini 

r lantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more tl 
had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbors; and these fifty ro 
being each of above a hundred weight, were well cured, and laid by agai 
the return of the fleet from Lisbon: and now increasing in business and 
wealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond i 
reach; such as are, indeed, often the rum of the best heads in business. Ha 
continued in the station 1 was now in, I had room for all the happy thing!

retired life, and which he had so sensibly described the middle station oil 
to be full of; but other things attended me, and I was still to be the vJ 
agent of all my own miseries; and particularly, to increase my fault, and doil 
the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows 1 should have ki® 
to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate ai 
ing to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inc| 
lion, in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fait j 
v^ain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of life, which naturej

e cont^t tibw, but I must go asi4 leave the happy view I had of hdxsis a 
m4 thtnriLng man in my new plantation, only to pursue a radi and ung-

fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of heaMi 
* world. ' . 

come, then, by the just degrees, to^ the particulars of this part of my 
: You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the Brazils^ 
eginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I had Ii0t 
learned the language, but had contracted acquaintance and friendsh^ 
g my fellow-planters, as well as amot^ the merchants at St. Salvad*^^ 

I was our port; and that, in my discourses among them, I had frequency 
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea; the manner 
ding with tfie Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon tlie 
for trifles— such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and 
ke-not only gold du^, Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, but Negroes, 
le service of the Brazils, in great numbers. 

ey listened always very attentively to my discourse on these heads, but 
ially to that part which related to the buying Negroes; which was a trade, 
t time, not only not far entered into, but as far as it was, had been carried 
ossientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and ei^rossed 
public stock; so that few Negroes were bought, and those exces^vdy 

lappencd, being in company with some merchants and planters of my 
intance, and talking of those thinp very earnestly, three of them came 
5 the next morning, and told me tney had been musing very much upon 
I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make a 
: proposal to me; and, after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that they 
mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations a$ 
IS I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as it was 
le that could not be carried on, because they could not publicly Sell the 
when they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to 
the N^roes on shore privately, and divide them among their own plan- 
s; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would go their supercargo 
5 ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they 
id me that I should have my equal share of the Negroes, without provid- 
part of the stock. 

i was a fair proposal, it must be coxifessed, had it been made to my one 
ad not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look after, Wlu^ 
ti a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a good ^ck 
it. But for me, that was thus entered and established, and had nothii^ 
but to go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to have 
or the other hundred pounds from England; and who in that time, and 
that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three or four 
tid pounds sterling, and that increasing too— for me to ihink of taich a 



WORKS OF DANIiaL bWOt 

vo3^ge was the most preposterous thmg that ever man in such ckcuinstanoels 
could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the offor, 
than I could restrain my first rambling desi^s, when my father’s good counsel 
was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they 
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose 
of it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, 
and entered into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, dis- 
posing of my plantation and effects in case of my death, making the captain 
of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging 
him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of the 
produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped in England. i 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to l«ep up 
my plantation: had I used half as much prudence to have looked into nw own 
interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have done and not to 
have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an undertak- 
ing, leaving all the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone upon 
a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say notmng of the 
reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather 
than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo fitt- 
nished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my partners in the voyage, 
I went on board in an evil hour, the ist of September, 1659, being the same 
day eight years that I went from my father and mother at Hull, in order tx) act 
the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interests. 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns, 
and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself; we had on board 
no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade with 
the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifles, especially 
litde looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the nordiward 
upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast, when 
we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, 
was the manner of course in those days. We had very good weather, only ex- 
cessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came to the height of 
Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of 
land, and steered as if we were bound for the Isle Fernando de Noronha, hold- 
ing our course N. E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course 
we p^ed the line in about twelve days’ time, and were, by our last obse^a- 
tion, in decrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a viofeftt 
tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began from the 
south-e^'st, came about to the north-west, and then setded in the north-east; 

. from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together 
we ooidd do nothing but drive, and scudding away before it, let it carry us 
^^whither ever fate and the fury of the winds mrected; and during these twd’*^® | 



■ya^ I moi not say tf»t I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor, iodteed* 
d any in die slup expect to save tbeir lives. 

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our men ificr 
the calenture, and one man and the boy wcuhed overboard. About the 
^dtfth dj^, the leather abating; a little, the master made an observation 
ell as he e^d, and found that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude^ 

It that he Was twenty-two degrees of longitude difference west from Cape 
. Awusdiin; so that he found he was upon the coast of Guiana, or the nmih 
irt of Bradl, beyond the River Amazons, towards that of the River Orooito-^ 
le, commonly called the Great River; and began to consult with mci wln^ 
»urse he should take, for the ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and te 
as going directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the sea-coast of 
merica with him, we concluded there was no inhabited country for us tO 
Lve recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Qaribbee Islands, and 
erefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes; which, by keeping off at sea, 

( avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, 
we hoped, in about fifteen days’ sail; whereas we could not possibly mate 
ir voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance bom to our Ship 
id to ourselves. 

With this design, we changed our course, and steered away N. W. by 
order to reafch some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief; tet 
ir voy^e was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of twelve 
agrees t^hteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us 
vay with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the way of 
1 human commerce, that had all our lives been saved as to die sea, we were 
ither in danger of being devoured by savages, than ever returning to bui^ 
TO country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early in the 
orning cried out, “Land!” and we had no sooner rim out of the cabin to look 
it, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship strudit 
on a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke ovijar 
in such a manner, that we expected that we should all have perished im^ ^ 
ately; and we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to didhsdr 
5 from the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like conditibfi to de^^srS^it; 

• conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We Imew noth- 
where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven; whettet te; 
ad or the main—whether inhabited or not inhabited; as the of the wind 
i stUl greatt though rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope^ 
0 have the ship hold many minutes without breaking into pieces, imtes 
^nds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, 

: looking upon one another, and expecting death every momem; <nsd evs^ ; 
r accordingly, preparing for another world; for thete was Ettle Or 
for us to do in tbfe; that which was our present comfort, and all the 



WORKS # bA^^aE^ ^ 

coinfort we had, was that, contrar)^ to our eiqpectatioii^ the $hip did not tiMlt 
yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship having 
thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to e^ect her getting 
off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to 
think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stem Just 
before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship’s rudder, 
and in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was driven off to 
sea; so there was no hope from her. We had another boat on board, but how to 
get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing; however, there w^ no time to 
debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minuite, and some 
told us she was actually broken already. \ 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, aW with the 
help of the rest of the men, got her slung over the ship’s side; an4 getting all 
into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in numbdr, to God’s 
mercy and the wild sea: for though the storm was abated considerably, yet 
the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore, and might be well called den mli 
zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly, that the 
sea went so high, that the boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably 
drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor if we had, could we have done 
anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy 
hearts, hke men going to execution; for we all knew that when the boat came 
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of 
the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner; 
and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with 
our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew 
not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, 
was, if we might find some bay or guff, or the mouth of some river, where 
by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the 
land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was nothing like this appeared; 
but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful 
than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as wc 
reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plain 
bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury, t 
it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as well from the boat as fr< 
one another, gave us not time t# say, “O God!” for we were all swallowed ^ 
in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I 
into the water; for though 1 swam very well, yet 1 could not deliver 
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or rat) 

^ towards the shore, and having spent itself, went baefc]

make on towards the land as fast as I could, befdre another wave should return 
take me up again; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw 
jie sea coming alter me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemv^ 
i;trhich I had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to hold 
my breath, and raise niyself upon the water, if I could; and so, by swimming* 

:o preserve my breathing and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible, my 
greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great way 
:owards the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it 
ivhen it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once twenty or thirty feet 
gieep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force and 
iftness towards the shore a very great way; but I held my breadi, and 
•'‘'isted myself to swim still forward with all my might, I was ready to burst 
th holding my breath, when as I felt myself raising up, so, to my immediate 
ief, 1 found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and 
jugh it was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it 
ieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. 1 was covered again 
th water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the 
Iter had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward against the return 
the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few moments, 
recover breath, and till the waters went from me, and then took to my 
els and ran, with what strength I had, farther towards the shore. But neither 
juld this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after 
B again; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards 
before, the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had wellnigh been fatal to me; for the sea having 
irried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of 
rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as 
my own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breath, beat the 
eath, as it were, quite out of my body; and had it returned again immediately, 
must have been strangled in &e water: but I recovered a little before the 
turn of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I 
solved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if 
>ssible, till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at 
St, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched 
other run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, thou^ 
went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and me 
xt run I took, I got to the main land; where, to my great comfort, I dam- 
red up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from 
nger, and quite out of the reach of the water. 

1 was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God 
tat my life was saved, in a case wherein there was, some minutes before, 
5arce my room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to the life, what 
it ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as 1 may say, 
jit of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at the custom, when a inale- 



^ ^ vmms or vxmm ipiim 

who has the halter about his neck^ is ded up, ai»i ftw gdieg m 1 
tmmi off, and has a reprieve brought to him; I say, I do not wcmdk that ffu 
bring a suxgeon witfi it, to let his blood that moment they tell him of j 
that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and ovcj 
whelm hhn. 

“For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.” 


I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands; and my whole being, as 
may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a thousan 
gestures and motwns, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon ^ ail my con 
i^ades that were drowned, and that there should not be one s|>ul saved bi 
myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any aim of then 
except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not ftUows. 

I wst my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and frokh of the se 
being so Wg, 1 could hardly see it, it lay so far off; and considere4» Lord! ho\ 
was It possible 1 could get on shore? \ 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, 
began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was nci 
to be done: and I soon found my comforts abate, and that; in a word, I had 
dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anythii^ 
either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before nit 
but that of perishing with hunger, or bemg devoured by wild beasts: and tha 
which was particularly afflicting to me was that I had no weapon, either tt 
hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against an] 
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothinj 
about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box* This m 
all my provision; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that fors 
while, I ran about like a madman. Nkht coming upon me, I began, with a 
heavy heart, to consider what would oe my lot if there were any ravenom 
beasts in that country, as at night they always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to get up intti 
a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but Aomy, which grew near me, and where I 
resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death 1 ^ould die, foi 
as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to 
see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did to my great joy; auJ 
having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I weia 
to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to place myself so that if I shoulil 
sleep I might not fall, Ajid having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, to 
my defence, I took up my lodging; and having been excessively fati^ed, I f®® 
f$st ^eep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have mme in tsf 
condition, and found myself more refreshed with it than, 1 chink, I ever vi 
on such an occasion. i 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated 
pD ^bat the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that whidi surprised to 
jrimmwas, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the where she hfi 
swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock wltoj 



ic $m mmidMb&t wbere I had hem m hrtliisi^ by mt wave mmm$ 

This being within about a mile from the shore where 1 was, mA the 
etidr^ to stand upright soli, I wished myself on board, that at least I might 
vt some necessaiy things for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about mo 
;ain, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and sea 
id tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked 
far as I could upon die shore to have got to her; but found a neck, or inlet> 

• water between me and the boat which was about half a mile broad^ so I 
,mc back for the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I 
)ped to find something for my present subsistence. 

A little after noon, 1 found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far out, 
lat I could come withm a quarter of a mile of the ship. And here I found U 
esh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, 
e had been ^1 safe: that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and 1 had not 
;en so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and companV^ 

I now was. This forced tears to my eyes again; but as there was litde relW m 
lat, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for 
le weather was hot to extremity, and took the water. But when I came to the 
lip, my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board; for as she 
y aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach 
► lay hold of. I swam around her twice, and the second time I imied a smaK 
icce of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the forc-^ 
lains so low, that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that 
ipe 1 got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here 1 found that the ship was 
ilged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; but that she lay so on the 
le of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay lifted up upon ihu 
ink, and her head low, almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was 
ee, and all that was in that part was dry: for you may be sure my first wirok 
as to search, and to see what was spoiled and what was free. And, first, 1 
und that all the ship’s provisions were dry and untouched by the water, iild 
ling very well dispos^ to eat, I went to the bread-room, and filled my 
»ckets with biscuit, and ate it as 1 went about other things, for 1 had no rime 
lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which 1 took a laim dram, 
d which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what was bcuore me» 
ow I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I 
resaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was m vain to sit still ana wish for what was not to be had; and tim 
tremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and two or rium 
rge spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship: i resolved to faft 
work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard as 1 could 
r their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away, 
^hen this was done, I went down riie ship’s side, and pulling them to me* t 
d four of them together at borii ends, as well as I could, in the form of a 
:t, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I 
and I comd walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear aiqF 



^ wosacs or damel depoe 

ismt weight, the pieces bdng too %ht. So I went to work^ and wiA tfc 
mpenter^ saw I cut a spare top-mast into Aree lengths, and added Aem 
myi3it, with a great deal of labor and pains. But the hope of furnishing ttmtl 
with necessaries, encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able t< 
have done upon anoAer occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My ncx 
care was what to load it wiA, and how to preserve what I laid upon it fron 
Ac surf of Ae sea: but I was not long considering this. I first laid all Ae planl 
or boards upon it Aat I could get, and having considered well what I mo^ 
wanted, I first got three of Ae seamen’s chests, which I had broken open anj 
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; Ae first of thes^e I filled witl 

S isions, viz.: bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goatfi 
(which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of Eujropean com, 
which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea^with us, ha 
Ae fowls were killed. There had been some barley and wheat together; but to 
my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten ani 
spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases or bottles belonging to our 
smppers, in which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or sk 
^ons of rack. These I bestowed by themselves, Acre being no need to put 
Aem into Ae chest, nor any room for them. While I was doing this, I found 
Ae tide began to flow, Aough very calm; and I had Ae mortification to see 
my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the sand, 
swim away. As for my breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I 
swam on board in them and my stocldngs. However, this set me on rummaging 
for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for 
present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon; as, first, tools 
to work with on shore. And it was after long searching that I found out the 
carpenter’s chest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize to me, and much moK 
valuable Aan a ship lading of gold would have been at that time. I got it down 
to my raft, whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew i 
general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two very 
good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. These I secured fiii 
with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. 1 
knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where our 
ffunner had stowed them; but with much search 1 found them, two of them 
ary and good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to my raft, with tW 
arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and oegan to think 
how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; 
and Ae least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements; ist, a smooA, calm sea; adly, the tide risii® 
and setting in to Ae shore; 3 dly, what litde wind there was blew me towari 
Ae land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to ^ 
boat^ and besides the tools which were in Ae chest, two saws, an axe, and * 
Jiainsner, with Ais cargo I put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts, my raft 
ytff well, only that 1 found it drive a little distant from Ac place 1 bad laodw 



ROB04S(^ mxj^ I 

tdmii I perceived th^t diere was scnne indraft of the water, and 

on^uentlys I hoped to find some cxeeh or river there, which I might xnafo 
i$e cf as a port to get to land with my camo. 

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a litde opezm^ of the 
and, and I foimd a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided my raft, 
is well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream. 

But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, 1 
hink, verily, would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coa^ 
ny raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground ^ 
he other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards 
he end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by 
(etdng rw back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could lipt 
hrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture 1 
Vas in; but holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that maniiat 
^ear half an hour, in which time the rismg of the water brought me a litde 
aore upon a level; and, a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated 
gain, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and then drivii^ 
ip higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on 
loth sides, and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for 
proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high uf 
le river: hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved m 
lace myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which, widj 
^eat pain and difficulty, 1 guided my raft, and at last got so near, that reaching 
round with my oar, 1 could thrust her directly in. But here I had like to have 
ipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep,-- 
lat is to say, sloping,— there was no place to land, but where one end of mj 
oat, if it ran on shore, would lie so nigh, and the other sink lower^ as before 
lat it would endanger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait til 
le tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, u 
old the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, whidi 1 
xpected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I found w^ 
uough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her on upon that fla 3 
iiece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two brokei 
(ars into the ground,— one on one side, near one end, and one on the othe; 
We near the other end, and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left tn} 
ift and cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper {dace for m3 
ibitatibn, and where to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever mi^n 
>ppen. yiTiere I was, I yet Igiew not; whether on the continent or an tsb^ 
fiether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts or not 
here was a hill not above a mUe from me which rose tip veiy steep and 
id which seemed to overtop wme odicr hills, which lay as in a ri^ from h 
Dirthward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, «md \ 
of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to riie 0 

at hai, where, after I bad with great labor and difiiculty got to the : 




^ my fate, to my great afflicdon, t3bat I was in an kiand o 

i'mtiy side by the sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which ky 
t way olf; and two small idands less than this, which ky about thrc 
acs to the west. 

^ found also that the island I was in was barren, and as I saw good rcaso 
to "believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw noa 
Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but I knew not their kinds; neither, when 
killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my comh 
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, op, the side of 
great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had been fired sphere since th 
creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, than from all the parts of th 
wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls, of many s%ts, making i 
confused screaming and crying, every one according to his usuallbotc, but no 
one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I kille4 I took it t( 
Ibe a kind of a hawk, its color and beak resembling it, but it had po talons oi 
ckws more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and tell to worl 
to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day: what tc 
do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid 
to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devoui 
me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chests and 
boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that night’s 
locking. As for food, 1 yet saw not which way to sufmly myself, except that I 
bad seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the wood where I shot 
the fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out of 
the ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the rigginj 
and sails, and such other things as might come to land; and I resolved to make 
anoflier voyage on board the vessel if possible. And as I knew that the ftst 
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set dt 
other things apart, till I had got everything out of the ship that I could get; 
Then I called a council—that is to say, in my thoughts—whether I should takf 
back the raft; but this appeared impracticaole; so 1 resolved to go as befo: 
virben the tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I went fit 
sny hut, having nothing on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, ssAi 
pair of pumps on my feet. 

; I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and hayii| 
bad experience of the first, I neither made this'so unwieldy, nor loaded its* 
b^d, but yet I brought away several things very useful to me; as, first, in 
i^irpenter’s stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a j 
^ww*)ack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most useful i 
® grindstone. All these I secured, together with several things bd 
gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of 
gWets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some smaU quan® 
y powder more; a large bagful of small shot, and a great roll of Aeet-l**

Besides these things^ I took all the mm's dothes that I cooM £mi, mi % 
»are lore*top saik a hamnK>ck) and some bedding; and with this I loaded tp^y 
cond raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort; 

I was under^ some apprehension, during my absence from the land, that at 
ast my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when 1 came back, I 
mnd no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon 
le of the chests, which, when 1 came towards it, ran away a little 
id then stood still. She sat very composed and uncx)ncemed, and looked fuS 
L my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. 1 presented gun 
) her, but as she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, 
3 r did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, 
Y the way, 1 was not very free of it, for my store was not great: however, I 
lared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it, and looked 
IS if pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more: so she 
larched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore,— though I was obliged to open the 
irrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being 
xee casks,— I went to work to make me a little tent, with the sail, and some 
0 ^ which I cut for that purpose: and into this tent I brought everythit^ 
lat I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty 
lests and casks up in a circle roimd the tent, to fortify it from any sudckai 
tempt, either from man or beast. 

When I had done this, 1 blocked up the door of the tent with some boards 
ithin, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreadii^ one of 
eds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at 
ngth by me, 1 went to bed for the first dme, and slept very quietly all nighti 
)r I was very weary and heavy; for the night before I had slept little, and 
ad labored very hard all day, to fetch all those things from the ship, and tn 
et them on shore. 

1 had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I believei 
!>r one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upngln in 
osture, I thought I ought to get everythii^ out of her that 1 could: so every 
^y, at low tide, I went on board, and brought away something or other; hat 
udcularly the third time 1 went, I brought away as much of me rigging as I 
)uld, as mo all the small ropes and rope twine I could get, wkh a piece Cf 
>are canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrd of wel 
iinpowder. In a word, 1 brought away all the sails first and bust; only that 1 
as obliged to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; 
ley were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only. 

But that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all, after I 
lade five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nottdi!^ mOre 10 
epect from the ship that was worth my meddling with;— I say, afti^ all thi$, I 
mud a great hogshead of bread, three large ruiuets of rum, or spirits, aUd a 
of sugar, ana a barrel of fine flour: this was surpriring to me, because I 
^d given over expecting any more provisions, except wh^ was qpoBed biy 



' WQiliE$ W DAMQEt laiKSE 

tine water. I soon emptied the b^shead of the bread, and wnqq>ed it 
patxrel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which 1 cut out; and, in a word, 1 go 
aU this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage and now, having plundered dtc shi] 
of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables: cutting thi 
great cable into pieces such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser or 
shore, with all the iron work I could get; and having cut down the spirit-sail 
yard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything I could, to make a large raft, ] 
loaded it with all these heavy goods, and came away; but my good Irnik begat) 
now to leave me; for this rsUt was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after 1 
was entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my g^ds, not 
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and tnrew me 
and all my cargo into the water; as for myself, it was no great harm, for I 
was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost, eswcially 
the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me: hoWeve^ when 
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the 
iron, though with infinite labor; for I had to dip for it into the water, a work 
which fat^ued me very much. After this, I went every day on board, and 
brought away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on board 
the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands could 
well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the calm 
weather hel^ I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by piec^; but 
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind began to rise; 
however, at low water I went on board, and though I thought I had rum* 
maged the cabin so effectually, that nothing more could be found, yet I dis- 
covered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three 
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives 
and forks: in another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money, --some 
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold and some silver 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: “O drug!” said I aloud, ^*wha) 
art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me,— no, not the taking off the 
ground: one of those knives is worth all this heap: I have no manner of use 
for thee; e’en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature 
whose life is not worth saving.” However, upon second thoughts, I took it 
away; and wrapping all in a piece of canvas, I began to think of making 
another raft: but while I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and 
die wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from 
the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make 
a raft with the wind off shore; and that it was my business to be gone before 
the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at 
llL Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across the 
diannel which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty 
M^ough, partly with the weight or the things I had about me, and partly from 
he roughness of the water; £pr the wind rose very hastily, and before it was 
high water it blew a storm. 



kctB&mm ckimm ' 

Stit I had got home to my Btdo tent, whete I lay, ifnxh all my wealth aWw 
tm very secure* It blew very hard all rfiat night, and in die morning, when 1 
looked out, behold no more ship was to be seen! 1 was a little surprised, but 
recovered myself with this satisfactory reflection, that I had lost no dme, 
nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of her that could be us^l 
to me; and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I was able to brhig 
away, if I had had more time* 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of her, 
except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed, divers pkces 
of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against 
either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; 
and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of 
dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent 
upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and descrip- 
tion of which, it may not be improper to give an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because it 
was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not be 
wholesome, and more particularly because there was no fresh water neat it; 
so I resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground* 

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be proper 
for me: ist, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned: adly, shelter from 
the heat of the sun: 3dly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or 
beasts: 4thly, a view to die sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not 
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not \^ing to banish 
all my expectation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side of a 
rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, so 
that nothing could come down upon me from tlie top. On the side of the roek 
there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, hke the entrance or door 
of a cave; but there was not really any cave, or way into the rock, at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to pitch 
my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice as 
long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the end of it, descended 
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea-side. It was OH 
the N. N. W. side of the hill; so that it was sheltered from the heat every day^ 
till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabout, which, in those countries, is 
near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place, wfaidh 
took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter, from the rock, and twenty yaiids 
in its diameter, from its beginning and ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into 
the ground till they stood very firm like piles, riie biggest end being out of 
the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on top. The two rows 
did not stand above six inches from one another. 

Then 1 took the pieces of cable which 1 had cut in the ship, and laid them lO 



one upon another, witbin the ctrde, between ikm tOWs of ^ 
ib the top, placing other stakes in die inside, leaning against than, about fm 
leet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that 
nkther man nor beast could get into it or over it This cost me a great deal 
df time and labor, especially to cut die piles in the woods, bring diem to the 
place, and drive them into the earth. 

^ The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a short 
ladder to go up over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after 
me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought,/from all the 
world, and consequently slept secure in the night, which odicrwise I could 
not have done; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no\need of all 
this caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from. \ 

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all riches, all 
my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the accoWit above, 
and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me from the tains, that ii| one part 
of the year are very violent there, I made double, one smaller tent within, and 
One large tent above it; and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, 
which 1 had saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which 1 had brought on shore, 
but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged to the 
mate of the ship. 

Into this tent 1 brought all my provisions, and everything that would spoil 
by the wet, and having thus inclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, 
which till now 1 had left open, and so passed and repassed, as 1 said, by a 
short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and bringing 
ail the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, 1 laid them up 
within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within 
fbout a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent, which 
served me like a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labor and many days before all these things were brought 
CO perfection; and, therefore, I must go back to some other things which took 
up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had laid my 
sch^e for the setting up my tent, and makmg the cave, that a storm of rain 
'ailing front a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after 
jiat, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much 
ai^rised with the lightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my 
mud as swift as the lightning itself: O my powder! My very heart within 
fie when 1 thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on 
vfaich, not my defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely 
lepended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the 
K>wder took fire, I should never have known who had hurt me. 

Such mpression did this make upon me, that after the storm wes overt I 
aU my works, my bmldix^ and fortifymg, and applied mysdf «o make 
igi attd boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a litde in a 



in hop whatever mght eotne, it tnkhe Mt ai} tete fire et ^eMiei 
4 keep so apart, that it should not be possible to make otie pm fire att^ 
ther. 1 finished tms work in about a fortnight; and 1 think txxy powder, wh^ 
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, was divided into nOC 
less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, 1 did not 
hend any danger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my tmtyt 
I call my kitchen; and the rea I hid up and down in holes amon^ the rocks, 
so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where 1 lam it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least evesy 
day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to sec if I could kill anything m 
for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the islmid pio- 
duced. The first time I went out, 1 presently discovered that there were goats 
in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended With 
this misfortune to me, viz.: that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, 
that it was the difficultest thing in the world to come at them; but I was not 
discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon 
happened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner 
for them: I observed if they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the 
rocks, they would run away, as in a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in 
the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence 
I concluded that, by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed 
downward, that they did not readily see objects that were above them; SO 
afterwards, I took this method,—! always climbed the rocks first, to get above 
them, and then had frequently a fair mark. 

The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she^oat, which had 
a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me, heartily; for, when 
the old one fell, the kid stood stock stiU by her, till I came and took her up; and 
not only so, but when 1 carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the 
kid followed me quite to my enclosure; upon which, 1 laid down the dam, and 
took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred il 
up tame; but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it, and eat it 
; These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved 
I my provisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could. 

1 Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to providb I 
I place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and what 1 did for that, as also how 1 
I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, 1 shall give a full account cd 
: in its pbee; but I must now give some little account of myself, and c# 
thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed, were not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition, for as I was not cast away upon thstt 
island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite out of the coutw 
of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.: some hundreds of leagues, oof td 
the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to coisrider^ I 
as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this dosolii 
manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plentifully down txsy 
^hen I made these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with tiiyi4 
^hy Providence should thus complendy ruin its creatures, and render ikdk 


m DAim nmm 


n^rable; so without help, abandoned, so entiirely d^tessed, tiittt i 
would hardly be rational to be thaiddPul for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts m 
to reprove me; and particularly, one day, walking with my gun in my hand 
by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition 
when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way, thus; ‘‘Well, yoi 
are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray remember, where are the rest o 
you? Did not you come eleven of you into the boat? Where are the ten? Whj 
were not they saved, and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better tl 
be here or there?” And then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to pe con$idere( 
with the good that is in them, and with what worse attends themu^ 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my\ subsistence 
and what would have been my case if it had not happened (which was a hun 
dred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the place where she fast struck 
and was driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all these things ou 
of her: what would have been my case, if I had been forced to have lived ii 
the condition in which I at fast came on shore, without necessaries of life, oj 


necessaries to supply and procure them^ “Particularly,” said I, aloud (thougl 
to myself), “what should I have done without a gun, without ammunition 
without any tools to make anything, or to work with, without clothes, bedding 
a tent, or any manner of covering^” and that now I had aU these in sufEcien 
quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner |is to liv( 
without my gun, when my ammuniuon was spent, so that I had a tolerable viev 
of subsisting, without any want, as long as 1 lived; for I considered, from thi 
beginning, how I would provide for the accidents that might happen and for thi 
time that was to come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent, bu 
even after my health and strength should decay. 

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being destroyec 
at one blast,—! mean my powder being blown up by lightning; and this made th 
thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I observe 
just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent life 
sucK perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall take it from it 
b^bning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of Sep 
t^ber, when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this home 
island; when the sun, being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just ovej 
my head: for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine 
d^Pes twenty-two minutes north of the line. , 

After 1 had been there about ten or twelve days, it cime into my thought 
that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and ink 
and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent this, I cut with ni) 
ktufe upon a large post, in capital letters; and maudng it into a great cross, ’ 
up on the shore where I first landed, “I came on shore here on the 30th oi 
SimtJember, 1659.” ^ 

Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my knifo, ant 
^Vtry^venth notch was as long again as the rest, and every fast day of tb 



Umth, as bx)g again as diat long one; and tbiis I kept my calendar, or 
montfaly, and yearly reckoning of time. 

In the next jplacc, we we to observe that among the many things whidh I 
brought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above mentioned» I 
made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at all less useful to me* 
which I omitted setting down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper; sev- 
eral parcels in the captain’s, mate’s, gunner^s, and carpenter’s keeping; three ot 
four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts* 
and books of navigation; all which I huddled together, whether I might want 
them or no: also I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo 
from England, and which I had packed up among my thmgs; some Portuguese 
books also; and, among them, two or three Popish prayer-books, and several 
other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget, that we had 
m the ship a dog, and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion 
to say something in its place; for I carried both the cats with me; and as for 
the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day 
after 1 went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many 
years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that lie 
could make up to me; 1 only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would 
not do. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and 1 husbanded 
them to the utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept things 
very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink ify 
any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mmd that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all that 
I had amassed together; and of these mk was one; as also a spade, pickaxe, and 
shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread, as for linen, I soon 
learned to want that without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was near a 
whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded my 
habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, wett 
a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in briu^^ 
ing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home 
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground; for whldh 
purpose, I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of 
one of the iron crows; which, however, though I found it, made driving those 
posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what need 1 have been cmi- 
cemetiat the temousness of anything I had to do, seeing 1 had time enough to 
do it in? nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at least tiuit ] 
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food, which 1 did ttnnatt 
or less every day. 

I now b^an to consider seriously my condition, and the chcumstaoces ] 
was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not so la^endb 
JO leave them to any that were to come after me, for I was likely to have W 
few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and affikr* 
^g my mmd; and as my reason bmn now to master my despondency, I h 
to comfort myself as well as I comd, and to set the goM against the evil, 



have something to disds^uish oase from worse; and { Matted trei 
^jnpori^Ujr, Uke debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miieri 
I sofifered, thus:— 


Evil. 

i am cast upon a horrible, desolate 
idand, void of all hope of recovery. 

I am singled out and separated, as it 
were, from all the world, to be miserable. 


I am divided from mankind,--a soli- 
taire; one banished from human society, 

1 have not clothes to cover me. 

I am without any defence, or means 
to resist any violence of man or beast. 

1 have no soul to speak to or relieve 


Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there was scarce 
my condition in the world so miserable, but there was something negative, 
>r something positive, to be thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction, 
rom die experience of the most miserable of all condidons in this world: that 
ive may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from, and' to set, in 
be descripdon of good and evil, on the credit side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a litde to relish my condidon, and given over 
ooking out to sea, to see if 1 could spy a ship,— say, giving over these things, I 
legan to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to make things as easy 
a me as I could. ^ 

1 have already described my habitadon, which was a tent under the side of a , 
surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; but I might now rathef 
sM k a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against«it of turfs, about two ftc^ i 
;^k on the outside: and after some dme (I think it was a year and a half) I i 
lised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with 
cH^hs of trees, and such things as I could get, to keep out the rain; which 1 ^ 
Mmd at some times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and ! 
Bp cave which I had made behind me. But 1 must observe, too, that at first tlus 
^ a cemfused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so dmy took ^ * 
.place; I had no room to tom myself; so 1 set myself to enlarge my osvtt i 


Good. 

But I am alive; and not drowned, i 
all my ship’s company were. . 

' But 1 am singled out, too, from al 
the ship’s crew, to be spared from death 
and He that miraculously 'laved me fron 
death, can deliver me fnm this con4 
non. I 

But 1 am not starved, ^d perishing 
on a barren place, affording no suste- 
nance. \ 

But I am in a hot climate, \ where, if 1 
had clothes, 1 could hardly wear them. 

But I am cast on an island where I see 
no wild beasts to hurt me, as I saw on 
the coast of Africa: and what if 1 had 
been shipwrecked there? 

But God wonderfully sent the ship 
in near enough to the shore, that I have 
got out as many necessary thipgs as will 
either supply my wants or enable me to 
supply myself, even as long as 1 live. 




inl hm the eaxih; for it e loose sandy roch, whkh 

to the labot 1 bestowed on it: and so when I found I was pretty sale m es 
beasts of prcy» I worked sideways, to the right hand into the rodt; and 
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come cm ' 
on the outside of my pale or fortification. 

Tto gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back way to my tent 
and to my storehouse, but gave me ipom to store my goods. 

‘ And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I found I 
most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I was not able 
to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not write, or eat, or 
do several things with so much pleasure, without a table: so I went to work 
And here I must needs observe, that as reason is the substance and origin nf 
the mafthematics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, and by mak 
mg the most rational Judgment of things, every man may le, in time, master 
of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my lifv‘; and yet, in tknei, 
by labor, application, and contrivance, I found, at last, that 1 wanted nothir^ 
but 1 could have made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made abnn^ 
dance of things, even without tools; and some with no more tools than an adsSe 
and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, and that widi 
infinite labor. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to out 
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with 
an axe, till 1 had brought it to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth widi 
my adze. It is true, by this method 1 could make but one board out of a whole 
tree; but this 1 had no remedy for but patience, any more than 1 had for tbe 
prodigious deal of time and labor which it took me up to make a plank or board: 
but my time or labor was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way 
as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the firat 
place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on the raft 
from the ship. But when I had wrought out some boards as above, I 
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another all 
one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on; and, in a 
to separate everything at large into their places, that I might come ea$2y at 
them. 1 knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and aQ things 
that would hang up: so that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a 
eral magazine of all necessary things; and I had everything so ready at my 
that k was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in su^ orw, tn# 
especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was that 1 began to keep a Journal of every day*s employment^ 
for, mdee4 at first, I was in too much hu^, and not omy hurry a$ to 
[hut in too much discomposure of mind; and my journal would have been fUB 
fof many dull things: for example, I must have said thus: “Sept. ^ojch.^-After I 
got to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being tha^ul to Gelid 
Ifor my deliverance, having first vomited, with the great miantiiy of salt welwr 
which had got into my stomach, and recovering myself a litdc, I ran ahWtId

and crying out, 1 was undone, undone!’ dll, dred and faint, I was farced tn 
m down on the grotuid to repose; but durst not sleep, for fear of being de* 
vOured.” 

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got all that 
I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a litde moun* 
tain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy, at a vast 
distance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and then after looking 
steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, 
and thus increase my misery by my folly. 

But having gotten over these things m some measure, and having settled my 
household stuff and habitation, made me a table and chair, and all ^ hand- 
some about me as I could, I began to keep my journal; of which I shall here 
give you the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over\ again) 
a$ long as it lasted: for having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off. ' 


The Journal. 

September 50, I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, 
during a dreadful storm, in the offing, came on shore on this dismal, unfortu- 
nate island, which I called “The Island of Despair;” all the rest of the ship’s 
company being drowned, and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circumstances 
I was brought to; viz.: I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place 
to fly to: and, in despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me: either 
that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to 
death for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of 
wild creatures; but slept soundly, though it rained all night. 

October f.—In the morning 1 saw, to my great surprise, the ship had floated 
with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer the island, 
which as it was some comfort, on one hand, for seeing her sit upright, and not 
broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board, and get 
some food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on the other hand, it 
renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, 1 imagined, if we had all 
staid on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have 
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might 
perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to 
some other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing myself 
on these things; but, at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand 
^ near as i could, and then swam on board. This day also it continued rainingt 
though with no wind at all. 

JB|pm the ist of October to the All these days entirely spent in many 
voyages to get aU I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore, 
Pyy t ide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also, in the days, though with some 
IMIfyals of fair weather; but it seems this was the rainy season 
upet. 20.^1 overset my raft, and aU the goods I had got upon it; but boiiig

jliod mtet, and things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them 
he tide was out. 

Ocu rj.— It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind; during whieli 
ime the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder than before, and 
a^as no more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. 

[ spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I had saved, that the 
rain might not spoil them. 

Oct, walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place to fix my 
labitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in the night, 
jithcr from wild beasts or men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper place, 
jnder a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment; which I re- 
x)lved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double pite, 
lined within with cables, and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the soth, 1 worked very hard in carrying all my goods to 
my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained exceedingly hard. 

The sistjin the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to See for 
jome food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid fol- 
lowed me home, which I afterwards killed also because it would not feed. 

November /.—I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the first night; 
making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon. 

Nov, 2.— I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber wnich 
made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little within the place 
[ had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. j.— I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, which were 
very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a table. 

Nov. This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out wirii 
my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion; viz.: every morning I walked out 
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not ram; then employed mysdf 
to work till about eleven o’clock; then ate what I had to live on; and from 
twelve till two I lay down to sleep, the weather being excessively hot; and then, 
in the evening, to work a^ain. The working part of this day and of the next Was 
wholly employed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, 
though time and necessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, 
as I believe they would do any one else. 

Nov. 5.— This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a wild 
cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every creature that I 
killed I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming back by the sea-riiore, 
1 saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was surprised, 
and almost frightened, with two or three seals, which, while I was gazing at, 
not well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. After my morning walk, I went to work with my table again, and 
finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7.— Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, lodi, and 
part of the 1 ith (for the 1 1 th was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a chair, 
with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and 
pen in the making I pulled it in pieces several times.

Notc.-I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for ihm 
on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Nov. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and cooled the 
fcarth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning, which 
frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I re- 
solved to separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that 
it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, /j, /d.-These three days I spent in making little square chests, or 
boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most, of powder; 
and so, putting the powder in, 1 stowed it in places as secure and remote from 
one another as possible. On one of these three days, I killed a large bird that was 
good to eat, but 1 knew not what to call it. \ 

Nov. /7.— This day 1 began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to m^e room 
for my further convenicncy. \ 

Note.— Three things 1 wanted exceedingly for this work: viz.: a piifkaxe, a 
shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so 1 desisted from my work, and btegan to 
consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As for the pick- 
axe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy, 
but the next thing was a shovel, or spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, 
indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it; but what kind of one to make 
I knew not. 

Nov. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that wood, 
or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call the iron-tree, for its exceedmg hafrdness, 
of this, with great labor, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought 
it home, too, with difficulty, enough, for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive 
hardness of the wood, and my having no other way, made me a long while upon 
this machine, for I v orked it effectually by little and little into the form of a 
shovel or spade, the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the 
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long, 
however, it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to, 
but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long in making, 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbarrow. A basket I 
could not make by any means, having no such things as tw igs that would bend 
to make wicker-ware— at least, none yet found out; and as to a wheelbarrow, 1 
fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had no notion of; neither did 
I know how to go about it; besides, I had no possible w^ay to make the iron 
gU(^eon for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in; so I gave it over, and 
so, for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing 
like a hod, which the laborers carry mortar in, when they serve the bricklayers. 
This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel; and yet this and the 
shoyel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wffieclbarrow, took me 
Up no less than four days— I mean always excepting my morning walk with my 
^n, which 1 seldom failed, and very seldom failed also brinsmi? home some- 
thing fit to eat. ® ^ 

Nov. 25.— My other work having now stood still, because of my makmj 
these tools, when they were finished 1 went on, and working every day, as my

syx«iigdi and time a&owed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deep^ 
erting my cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note.— During all this time, I worked to make this room, or cave, spacious 
enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining*^ 
room, and a cellar As for my lodging, I kept to the tent, except that some- 
times, in the wet season of the year, it tamed so hard, that I could not ke^ 
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pafe 
with long poles, m the form of rafters, leaning agamst the rock, and load tncm 
with flags and large leaves of trees, hke a thatch 
December lo —I began now to thmk my cave or vault finished, when on a 
sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down 
from the top and one side, so much that, m short, it frighted me, and not with- 
out reason, too, for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger. 

I had now a great deal of work to do over again, for I had the loose earth to 
carry out, and, which was of more importance, I had the ceihng to prop up, so 
that I might be sure no more would come down. 

Dec, li —This day I went to work with it accordmgly, and got two shores 
or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across over eadi 
post, this I finished the next day, and setting more posts up with boards, in about 
a week more I had the roof secured, and the posts, standing m rows, served me 
for partitions to part off the house. 

Dec, /7.-From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up nails on 
■the posts, to hang everythmg up that could be hung up, and now I began to be 
I h some order w ithin doors. 

Dec, 20.— Now I carried everythmg into the cave, and began to furnish my 
lOuse, and set up some pieces of boards hke a dresser, to order my victuals upon; 
ut boards began to be very scarce with me also I made me another table. 

Dec, 2^.— Much ram all night and all day no stirring out. 

Dec, 25.— Ram all day. 

Dec, 26 —No ram, and the earth much cooler than before and pleasanter. 

Dec, 27.— Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that I caught it, and led it 
lome m a strmg, when I had it at home, I bound and splintered up its leg, whidii 
m broke. 

N. B —I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong 
IS ever, but by my nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the litde 
]reen at my door, and would not go away. This was the first time that I enter- 
amed a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food 
vhen my powder and shot were all spent. 

Dec, 28 y 2% 50, 5/.— Great heats, and no breeze, so that there was no stirring 
|hroad, except m the evening, for food, this time I spent m putting all my things 
T order withm doors. 

] amtary /.—Very hot still but I went abroad early and late with my gun, and 
^y still m the middle of the day. This evenmg, gomg farther into the valleys 
vhich lay towards the centre of the island, I found there were plenty of goats, 
hough cxceedmgly shy, and hard to come at, however, I resolved to try if I 
^uld not brmg my dog to hunt them down. 



^ WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Jan. ^.—Accordingly, the next day I went ont with my dog, and set him TOOt 
the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog, and hi 
knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them. 

Jan. 5.-I began my fence, or wall; which, being still jealous of my being at- 
tacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong. 

Ivj, B.—This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said ir 
the journal; it is sufficient to observe that I was no less time than from the 3c 
of January to the 14th of April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall 
though it was no more than about twenty-foxir yards in lengtii, being a hali 
circle, from one place in the rock to another place, about eight yai^s from it 
the door of the cave being in the centre behind it. i 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many nays, najr, 
sometimes weeks together: but I thought I should never be perfectly feecure till 
this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible latipr every- 
thing was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods, ifnd driv- 
ing them into the ground; for I made them much bigger than I needed to have 
done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced, with a turf wall 
raised up close to it, 1 persuaded myself that if any people were to come on 
shore there, they would not perceive anything like a habitation; and it was very 
well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion, 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day, when 
the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks pf some- 
thing or other to my advantage; particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, 
which build, not as wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the 
holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavored to breed them up 
tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps 
was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; however, 

I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones, which were very good 
meat. And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found myself wanting 
in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make, as, 
indeed, with some of them it was; for instance, I could never make a cask to 
be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could never 
^rive at the capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks about 
it; I could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true to one another at 
to make them hold water; so I gave that also over. In the next place, I was at a 
great loss for candles; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally 
b^ seven o’clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of beeswai 
with which 1 made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of that 
now; the only remedy 1 had was, that when 1 had killed a goat I saved the tal‘ 
low, and with a httle dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which 
added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, thougl 
not ai^lear steady light like a candle. In the middle of all my labors it happci^ 
ffiat, rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, as 1 hinted before, ha< 
teen filled with corn for the feeding of poultry,— not for this voyage, but 
forC) as I suppose, when the ship came irom Lisbon. The little remainder ^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 0 

com that had been in the bag was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing 
in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some 
other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it, for the fear of the 
lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of com out of it on one side 
of my fortification, under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned, that I threw this 
stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that I had thrown 
anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few 
stalks of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might 
be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised and perfectly astonished, 
when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which 
were perfectly green barley, of the same kind as our European—nay, as our Eng- 
lish barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts 
on this occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all; in- 
deed, I had very few notions of religion in my head, nor had entertained any 
sense of anything that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as we 
lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as inquiring into the end of 
Providence in these things, or his order in governing events for the world. 
But after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which 1 knew was not proper 
for corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me 
strangely, and 1 began to suggest that God had miraculously caused his grain 
to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed purely for 
my sustenance on that wild, miserable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I bc- 
jan to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my ac- 
count; and this was the more strange to me, because 1 saw near it still, all along 
)y the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks 
)f rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was 
ishore there. 

1 not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my support, 
[)ut not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all over that part of 
the island where 1 had been before, peering in every corner, and under every 
rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any. At last it occurred to my 
thoughts, that I shook a bag of chickens’ meat out in that place; and then the 
^vender began to cease; and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to God’s 
providence began to abate, too, upon the discoverijig that all this was nothing 
but what was common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange 
ind unforeseen a providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was really 
he work of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve 
plains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the 
test, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in 
that particular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up 
(mmcdiately , whereas, if I had thrown it anyw here else, at that time, it bad been 
pumt up and destroyed. 

1 carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their season, which

wm about the end of June; and, laying up every com, I resolved to sow them 
all again, hoping, in time, to have some quantity, sufficient to supply me with 
bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow myself the least 
grain of this com to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards/ 
m its order; for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not observing the 
proper time; for I sowed it Just before the dry season, so that it never came up 
at all, at least not as it would have done: of which in its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice, 
which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to the same pur- 
pose, to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it without 
baking, though I did that also after some time. 

But to return to my journal:— 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get my )iall done: 
and the 14 th of April, I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but 
over the wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outsid^ of my 
habitation. 

April /<?.— I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top, and then 
pulled It up after me, and let it down in the inside: this was a complete en- 
closure to me, for within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me 
from without, unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had all my labor 
overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus: As I was busy in the 
inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted 
with a most dreadful surprising thing mdeed: for, all on a sudden, I found 
the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my ca\e, and from the edge 
of the hill over my head, and two of the posts f had set up in the cave cracked 
in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what was 
really the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in, as some 
of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to 
my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for 
fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down upon me. I 
had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I plainly saw it was a 
terrible earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight 
minutes distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the strong- 
en rauding that could be supposed to have stood on the earth, and a great piece 
m the top of a rock, svhich stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell 
d^, with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my Hfe. 1 perceived also 
the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were 
stronger under the water than on the island. 

*“’*“'* with the thing itself, having never felt the like, nor 
&sco^ vnth any one that had, that 1 was like one dead or stupefied; and 

sick, like one that was to^ at sea; 

“ « '^ere, and rousing roe 
condraon I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought 
hill falhng upon my tent and all my household gtJods 
tod burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul within me a seconl^e- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE || 

After the third diock was over, and I felt no more for some lime, I bi^an 
to take courage; and I had not heart enough to go over my wall again, f<»r 
fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and 
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while, I had not die least serious 
religious thought; nothing but the common “Lord, have mercy upon me!” and 
when it was over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it would 
rain; soon after that, the wind arose by litde and little, so that in less than half 
an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane: the sea was, all on a sudden, cov- 
ered over with foam and froth; the shore was covered with the breach of the 
water; the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it was. This 
held about tliree hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours more it was 
quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All this while 1 sat upon the ground, 
very much terrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, 
that these winds and rain being the conseauences of the earthquake, the eardi- 
quake itself was spent and over, and 1 might venture into my cave again. With 
this thought, my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade 
me, I went in and sat down in my tent, but the rain was so violent, that my tent 
was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go into my cave, 
though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This 
violent rain forced me to a new work, viz.: to cut a hole through my new forti- 
fication, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have flooded my 
cave. After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks 
of the eanhquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now to support 
niy spirits, wliich indeed wanted it very much, 1 went to my little store, and 
took a small sup of rum; which, however, 1 did then and always very sparingly, 
knowing 1 could have no more when that was gone. It continued raining all 
that night, and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but 
my mind being more composed, I began to think of what I had best do; conclud- 
ing, that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living 
for me in a cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place, 
which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself 
secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded if I staid where I was, I should 
certainly, one time or other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where it 
now stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and which, 
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent: and I 
the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and 
how to remove my habitation. The fear of being swallowed up alive made me 
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without 
any fence was almost equal to it: but still, when I looked about, and saw how 
everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from 
danger, it made me very loath to remove. In the mean time, it occurred to me 
that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be 
contented to venture where 1 was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had 
secured it so as to remove to it. & with this resolution 1 composed mysdf for 



52 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

a time; and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a wall 
with piles and cables, &c*, in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it, when 
it was finished; but that 1 would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, 
and fit to remove. This was the 21st. 

Aprtl 22.— The next mormng 1 began to consider of means to put this resolve 
into execution, but I was at a great loss about my tools. I had three large axes, 
and abundance of hatchets (for we earned the hatchets for traffic with the 
Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty, hard wood, they were 
all full of notches, and dull, and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it 
and grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a statesman would 
have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life\and death 
of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it wimmy foot, 
that I might have both of my hands at liberty. \ 

Note.— I had never seen any such thmg in England, or at least not to take 
notice how it was done, though since I have observed it is very common there, 
besides that, niy giindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a 
full week’s work to bring it to perfection. 

April 28 j 2p.— These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my ma- 
chine for turning my grindstone performing very w ell. 

April 50.— Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I took 
a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made my 
heart very heavy. 

May I.— In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the tide being very 
low, I saw something he on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a 
cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the 
wreck of the ship, which were driven on the shore by the late hurricane; and 
looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to he higher out of the 
water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was driven on shore, and 
soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and the pov^- 
der was caked as hard as a stone: however, I rolled it farther on shore for the 
present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, 
to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. The fore- 
castle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet, and the 
stem, which was broke in pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the 
sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on 
one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that 
whereas there was a great place of water before, so that I could not come within 
a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, 1 could now walk quite 
up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon con- 
cluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence die ship was 
more broken open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore, which 
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the 
land. 

^ This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my habita- 
tticm, and 1 busied myself mightily, that day especially, in searching whether I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

could make any way into the ship; but I found nothing was to be ejmectcd of 
that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. However, 
as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to 
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her 
would be of some use or other to me. 

May I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which 1 
thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I cut 
it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay 
highest, but the tide coming in, 1 was obliged to give over for that time. 

May went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that 1 durst eat of, till I was 
weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin, I 
had made me a long Ime of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I fre- 
quently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the 
sun, and ate them dry. 

May 5.— Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought 
three great fir planks from the decks, which I tied together, and made to float 
on shore when the tide of flood came on. 

May (J.— Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of her, and other 
pieces of iron-work; worked very hard, and came home very much tired, and 
had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7.--Wcnt to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but found the 
weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut; the several 
pieces of the ship seemed to he loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that 
I could see into it, but it was almost full of water and sand. 

May W ent to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the deck, 
which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. 1 wrenched open two planks, 
and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck 
for next day. 

May p.— Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of 
the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could 
not break them up. 1 felt also a roll of Enghsh lead, and could stir it, but it was 
too heavy to remove. 

May Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many pieces of 

timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred- weight of iron. 

May /p.— I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off the roll of 
lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as it 
lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the 
hatchet. 

May /(f.— It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more 
broken by the force of the water; but I staid so long in the woods, to get pigeons 
for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day. 

May 17.— 1 saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great distance, 
near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were, and found it was a 
piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away, 
i May 24.— Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard labor 
[I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first blowing tide sev- 



’5* ' WCMEIKS OF DANIEL Dt3fOE 

t 

C3sk^ floated out, and two of die seamen’s chests; but the wind blowing 
foom the shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogs- 
head which had some Brazil pork in it; but the salt water and the sand had 
Spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except the time 
necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during this part of my em- 
ployment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed 
out; and by this time I had got timber, and plank, and iron-work enough to have 
built a good boat, if 1 had known how; and also I got, at several times, and in 
several pieces, near one hundred-weight of the sheet-lead. 

June Going down to the sea-side, I found a large tortoise, or turtle. This 
was the jfirst I had seen, which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect 
of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other side ctf the island, 
1 might have had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but per- 
haps had paid dear enough for them. \ 

June /7.— I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore\eggs; and 
her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savory and pleasant that ev^r I tasted 
in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this hor- 
rid place. 

June /i?.— Rained all day, and I staid within. 1 thought, at this time, the rain 
felt cold, and I was something chilly; which I knew was not usual in that lati- 
tude. 

June 7^.— Very ill, and shhering, as if the weather had been cold. 

June ^0.— No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish. 

June ;?7.— Very ill, frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of my sad 
condition, —to be sick, and no help: prayed to God, for the first time since the 
storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why; my thoughts being all con- 
fused. 

June little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of sickness. 

June 25,— Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent headache. 

June 2^.— Much better. 

June An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours; cold fit, and hot, 
with faint sweats after it. 

June . 25 .— Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but found my- 
self very weak; however, I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it 
home, and broiled some of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made 
some broth, but had no pot. 

June 27.— The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day, and neither ate nor 
drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not strength to stand 
up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light- 
headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not wbat to say; 
Only I lay and cried, “Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord have mercy 
upon me!” I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours; till the fit wear- 
ing off, 1 fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I 
found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty; however, as I 
had no water in my habitation, I was forced to he till morning, and went to 
^ deep again. In this second sleep, I had this terrible dream: I thought that I

sittiiig on Ae ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm 
blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black 
cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground: he was all over as 
bright as a flame, so that I could just bear to look towards him: his countenance 
was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe; when he 
stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it 
had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my appjj;ehensiont 
as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner landed upon the 
earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his 
hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he 
spoke to me,— or 1 heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the 
terror of it. All that 1 can say 1 understood, was this: “Seeing all these things 
have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die,’ —at which words, I 
thought he lifted up the spear that was m his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that 1 should be able to 
describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision. I mean, that even while 
it was a dream, 1 even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible to 
describe the impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and 
found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas’ no divine knowledge. What 1 had received by the good instruction 
of my father was then worn out by an unmterrupted senes, for eight years, of 
jseafaring wickedness, and a constant conversauon with none but such as were, 
like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not remember that 1 had, 
|in all that time, one thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards 
[towards God, or inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain 
[stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or consciousness of evil, had entirely 
pverwhelnied me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked 
creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be; not having the least 
pense, either of the fear of God, m danger, or of thankfulness to God, in deliver- 
lance. 

[ In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more easily 
believed, when 1 shall add, that through all the variety of miseries that had to 
this day befallen me, I never had so much as one thought of it being the hand 
pf God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin— my rebellious behavior 
iagainst my father,— or my present sms, which were great,— or so much as a 
lunishment for the general course of my wicked life. When I was on the des- 
ecrate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, 1 never had so much as one 
bought of what would become of me, or one wish to God to direct me whither 
[ should go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, 
IS well from voracious creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely thoughtless 
of a God or a Providence, acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, 
and by the dictates of common sense only, and, indeed, hardly that. When I 
'vas delivered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain, well used, and 
iealt justly and honorably with, as well as charitably, I had not the least thank* 
ulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked, rumed, and in danger 
of drowning, on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Judgmeat. I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and bon 
to be always miserable. 

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship^s crev 
drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and som 
transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have come up t( 
true thankfulness; but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight of joy 
or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon th( 
distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singlec 
me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry wh} 
Providence had been thus merciful unto me. Even just the same common sort ol 
joy which seamen generally have, after they are got safe ashore^ from a ship, 
wreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of punch, and foiteet almost as 
soon as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it. Even when\l was, after 
wards, on due consideration, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast 
on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human land, out of all h<^e of relief, 
or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that ] 
should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, 
and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my preser- 
vation and supply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as 
a judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were thoughts 
which very seldom entered my head. 

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had, at first, some 
little iimuence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as 1 
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever that part of die 
thought was removed, all the impression that was raised from it wore off also, 
as I nave noted already. Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more 
terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible power 
which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the 
impression it had made went off also. I had no more sense of God, or his judg- 
ments—much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from his 
hand—than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life. But now, when 
I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place 
itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong 
distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, 
that had slept so long began to awake, and 1 began to reproach myself with my 
past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the 
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so 
vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed me for the second or third day 
of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadfd 
reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from me like praying to 
God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires or 
with hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts 
were confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dyio? 
in such a miserable condition raised vapors into my head with the mere appre- 
hension; and in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might 
express. But it was rather exclamation, such as, “Lord, what a miserable creature 



ROBINSON CRUSOE SJr 

n 1! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what will 
jcome of me?*’ Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no inore 
Ir a good while. In this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind, 
id presently his prediction, which 1 mentioned at the beginning of this story, 
iz.: that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would 
ave leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there 
light be none to assist in my recovery. “Now,” said J, aloud, “my dear father’s 
rcS-ds are come to pass; God’s justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help 
r hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me 
1 a posture or station of life wherein I might have been happy and easy: but I 
^ould neither see it myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from my 
larents. 1 left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under 
le consequences of it. I refused their help and assistance, who would have 
fted me in the world, and would have made everything easy to me. And now 
have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support, 
nd no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.” Then 1 cried out, “Lord, be 
ly help, for I am in great distress!” This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, 
hat I had made for many years. 

But to return to my journal:— 

June . 2 ;?.— Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and the 
it being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and terror of my dream 
vere very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague would return again the 
lext day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and support mysdf 
vhen 1 should be ill: and the first thing I did, 1 filled a large square case-bottle 
vith water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take off the 
:hill or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum 
nto it, and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat’s flesh and 
)roiled it on the coals, but could cat very little. I walked about, but was very 
veak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable 
:ondition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At night, I made 
ny supper of three of the turtles’ eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, 
IS we call it, in the shell, and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God’s 
)lessing to, that I could remember, in my w hole life. After 1 had eaten, I tried 
:o walk, but found myself so weak, that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never 
vent out without that; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, 
ooking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth, 
^s I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What is this earth 
ind sea of which I have seen so much? Whence is it produced? And what am 
1 and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal? Whence are 
ive> Sure we arc all made by some secret power, who formed the earth and sea, 
:he air and sky. And who is that? Then it followed most naturally, It is God that 
las made all. Well, but then, it comes on strangely, if God has made all these 
things, He guides and governs them all, and all things that concern them; for 
the power that could make all things must certainly have power to guide and 
direct them. If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His works, either 
*vithout His knowledge or appointment. 



58 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am here, 
and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without His appoint* 
ment, He has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my thought 
to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested upon me with 
the greater force, that it must needs be that God had appointed all this to befall 
me; that 1 was brought into this miserable circumstance by His direction. He 
having the sole power, not of me only, but of everything that happened in the 
world. Immediately it followed, Why has God done this to me? What have 1 
done to be thus used? My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, 
as if 1 had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voibe, “Wretch* 
dost thou ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, 
and ask thyself, what thou hast not done? Ask, why is it that thou Wert not long 
ago destroyed^ Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; Wiled in the 
fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, devoured by the wild 
beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowmed hercy when all the crew perished bit 
thyself? Dost thou ask, What have 1 done?” I was struck dumb w ith tnese relief - 
tions, as one astonished, and had not a word to say,— no, not to answer to myself, 
but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over iiiy 
wall, as if 1 had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and 
I had no inclination to sleep; so 1 sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, 
for it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distemper 
terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians take no 
physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and 1 had a piece of a roll of 
tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was 
green, and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure both 
for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked for, the tobacco, 
and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles 
which I mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found leisure, or 
inclination, to look into. I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the 
tobacco with me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in 
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried several expeii- 
ments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a 
piece of leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first, almost stupe- 
fied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much 
used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and 
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and, lastly, I burnt some upon a 
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear 
it, as well for the heat, as almost for suffocation. In the interval of this operation, 
1 took up the Bible, and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed 
with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at the time; only having opened the 
book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these: “Call on me id 
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.” Thebe 
words were very apt to my case, and made some impression upon my thoughtb 
at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did afterwards, to 
as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thin? 



ROBINSON C31USOE

/as so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of thirds, that I began to say 
s the children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, “Can God 
pread a table in the wilderness?” so I began to say, “Can God Himself deliver 
Se from this place?” And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, 
his prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made a 
Teat impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew now 
ate, and the tobacco had, as 1 said, dozed my head so much that I inclined to 
leep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in 
he night, and went to bed. But before 1 lay down, I did what 1 never had done 
n all my life; I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, 
bat if I called upon Him in the day of trouble. He would dcli\ cr me. After my 
)roken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which 1 had steeped 
he tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that 1 could scarcely 
ret it down; immediately upon this I went to bed. I found presently it flew up 
nto my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, 
3y the sun, it must necessarily be near three o’clock in the afternoon the next 
Jav ; nay, to this hour 1 am partly of opinion that 1 slept all the next day and 
light, and till almost three the day after; for otherwise, I know not how 1 should 
ose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some 
/cars after 1 had done; for if 1 had lost it by cre^ssing and recrossing the line, 

: should have lost more than one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, 
ind I never knew which w^ay. Be that, however, one way or the other, when 1 
iwaked 1 found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheer- 
ful; when I got up 1 was stronger than 1 was the day before, and my stomach 
better, for 1 was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued 
much altered for the better. This was the 29th. 

; The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but 
Bid not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a brand 
joose, and brought them home; but was not very forward to eat them; so I ate 
lome more of the turtles’ eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed 
:he medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before, —the tobacco 
iteeped in rum; only I did not take so much as before, nor did 1 chew any of the 
fcaf, or hold my head over the smoke; however, 1 w^as not so w cU the next day, 
cvhich was the ist of July, as 1 hoped 1 should have been; for 1 had a little spice 
)f the cold fit, but it was not much. 

July 2.— I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself with it 
IS at first, and doubled the quantity w^hich 1 drank. 

July I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my full 
strength for some weeks after. While 1 was thus gathering strength my thoughts 
’an exceedingly upon this scripture, “I will deliver thee;” and the impossibility 
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it; 
>ut as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind 
'hat 1 pored so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I 
iisregarded the deliverance I had received, and I was, as it were, made to ask 
tyself such questions as these; viz.: Have 1 not been delivered, and wonderfully 
from sickness? from the most distressed condition that could be, and that 



60 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it? Had I done my part? 
God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him; that is to say, I had not 
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance: and how could I expect 
greater deliverance? This touched my heart very much; and immediately 
knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for the recovery from my sickness. 

July In the morning, I took the Bible; and beginning at the New Testa- 
ment, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile 
every morning and every night; not tying myself to the number of chapters, 
but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after I set seri- 
ously to this work, till 1 found my heart more deeply and sincerel)j' affected with 
the wickedness of my past life. The impression of my dream reyived; and the 
words, “All these things have not brought thee to repentance,” rdp seriously m 
my thoughts. 1 was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it 
happened providentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to 
these words: “He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and give 
to remission.” 1 threw down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands 
lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried aloud, “Jesus, thou Son of 
David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance!” This 
the first time I could say, in the true sense of the words, that 1 prayed in all my 
life; for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with a true Scripture 
view of hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of God; and fron 
this time, I may say, that I began to have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, “Call on me and I vil 
deliver thee,” in a different sense from what I had ever done before; for thcr 
had no notion of anything being called deliverance y but my being deliver 
from the captivity 1 was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place, ; 
the island w as certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the wor 
But now I learned to take it in another sense: now I looked back upon my pasi 
life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought 
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my 
comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be 
delivered from it, or think of it; it was all of no consideration, in comparison to 
this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that wheneve! 
they come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a mud 
greater blessing than deliverance from affliction. 

But leaving this part, I return to my journal:— 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way < 
living, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by ^ 
constant reading the Scripture and praying to God,' to things of a higher nature, 
I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of; also 
my health and strength returned, 1 bestirred myself to furnish myself wit 
everything that 1 wanted, and make my way of living as regular as 1 could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, 1 was chiefly employed in walking aboui 
with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that was gather^ 
hig up his strength after a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to be imagined bo 
low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The application which I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


61 

se of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never cured an ague before; 
[either can 1 recommend it to any to practise, by this experiment: and though 
c did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had 
requent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time; I learned from it 
Iso, this, in particular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the most 
>crnicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those rains which 
anic attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came 
ti the dry season was almost always accompanied with such storms, so 1 foimd 
hut rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and 
October. 

1 had now been in this unhappy island above ten months; all possibility of 
Icliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I 
irmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having 
low secured my habitation, as 1 thought, fully to my mind, 1 had a great desire 
o make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other produc- 
ions 1 might find, which 1 yet knew nothing of. 

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey of the 
sland itself. 1 went up the crcck first, where, as I hinted, 1 brought my rafts on 
hore. I found, after I came about wo miles up, that the tide did not flow any 
lighcr; and that it was no more than a little brook of running water, very fresh 
nd good: but this being the dry season there was hardly any water in some parts 
>f it; at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived. On 
he banks of this brook 1 found many pleasant savannas or meadows, plain, 
ni()(Jth, and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the 
lighcr grounds, where the w’atcr, as might be supposed, never overflowed, I 
ound a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong 
talk; there were divers other plants, which 1 had no notion of or understanding 
[bout, that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, w hich 1 could not find 
)ut. 1 searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make 
heir bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not 
indcrstand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but w ild, and for want of cultiva- 
ion, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and 
:amc back, musing with myself what course 1 might take to know the virtue 
ind goodness of any of the fruits or plants whicli 1 should discover; but could 
^ring it to no conclusion; for, in short, 1 had made so little observation while 
was in the Bra/ils, that 1 knew little of the plants in the field; at least very little 
hat might serve me to any purpose now in my distress. 

The Tjext day, the rdth, I went up the same way again; and after going some- 
hing farther than 1 had gone the day before, I found the brook and savannas 
-case, and the country became more woody than before. In this part I found 
lifferent fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground, in great 
ihundancc, and grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread indeed over the 
'rees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in tiicir prime, very ripe and 
rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but 
t was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remembering that 
ivhen I was ashore in Barbary the eating of grapes killed several of our English- 



fi2 WORKS OF DAMEL DEFOE 

men, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But 
found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them « 
the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I though 
would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and agreeable to eat, when no grape: 
could be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation, which, 
by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the 
night I took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree, where 1 slept well, 
and the next morning, proceeded upon my discovery, travelling nearly four 
miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north, with 
a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me. At the end (Iff this march, 
I came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend to t3|ie west; and 
a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of tho hill by me, 
ran the other wa} , that is, due east; and the country appeared so fre^h, so green, 
so flourishing, e\ery thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish of 4>pring, that 
it looked like a planted garden. 1 descended a little on the side of that delicious 
vale, surveying it w ith a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other 
afflicting thoughts, to think that this w^as all my own, that 1 was king and lord 
of all this country indcfeasibly% and had a right of possession; and, if I could 
convey it, I might ha\ e it in inheritance, as completely as an}" lord of a manor 
in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange, and lemon, and citron 
trees; but all w ild, and \ ery few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, 
the green limes that 1 gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very whole- 
some; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very 
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now I had business enough 
to gather and carr} home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes 
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which 1 knew was 
approaching. In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, 
a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another 
place; and taking a few of each with me, 1 travelled homewards; and resohed 
to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what 1 could make, to carry the 
rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home 
(so I must now call my tent and my cave); but before I got thither the grapes 
were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having 
broken them and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to the 
limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day, being the 19 th, I went back, having made me two small bags to 
bring home my harvest; but 1 was surprised, when coming to my heap of grapes, 
which were so rich and fine when 1 gathered them, I found them all spread 
about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance 
eaten and devoured. By this, I concludecl there were some wild creatures there- 
abouts, which had done this; but what they were I knew not. However, as I 
found there was no laying them up on heaps, and no carrying them away in ^ 
sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, and the other way they would 
be crushed with their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large 
quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the trees, that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 63 

key might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried 
many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey I contemplated with great pleasure 
the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; the security 
from storms on that side, the water, and the wood; and concluded that I had 
hitched upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part of tfie 
Country. Upon the whole, 1 began to consider of removing my habitation; and 
looking out for a place equally safe as where now I was situate, if possible, in 
kat pleasant, fruitful part of the island. 

f This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some 
Itinie, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when 1 came to a nearer 
jvicw of it, I considered that 1 was now by the sea-side, uhcre it was at least 
bossible that something might happen to my advantage; and, by the same ill fate 
pat brought me hither, might bring some other unha[)py w retches to the same 
place, and though it was scarcely probable that any such thing should ever 
jhappen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the 
iisland, was to anticipate iiiy bondage, and to render such an afTair not only 
[improbable, but impossible; and that therefore 1 ought not by any means to 
!reino\e. However, I was so enamored of this place, that I spent much of my 
time there for the whole of the remaining part of the month of July; and though, 
Upon second thoughts, 1 rcsoh cd not to rcmo\ c, yet 1 built me a little kind of 
a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double 
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled between with brush- 
wood, and here I lay \cry secure, sometimes two or three nights together; 
always going over it wdth a ladder; so that I fancied now I had my country- 
house and my sea-coast house, and this work rook me up to the beginning of 
August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labor, when the 
rams canic on, and made me stick dose to my first habitation; for though I had 
made me a tent like the other, w ith a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet 
I liad not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to 
retreat into when the rains were eMraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I bad finished my bower, and 
began to enjoy myself. The 3 d of August, 1 found the grapes I had hung up 
perfectly dried, and indeed w ere excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to 
take tlicm dowm from the trees, and it was very' happy that I did so, for the 
rams which followed would Ime spoilt them, and I had lost the best part of 
iiy winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner 
iiad 1 taken them all dow n, and carried most of them home to my cave, but it 
3egan to rain; and from hence, which was the 141 !! of August, it rained, more or 
css, every day till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I 
'ould not stir out of my cave for several days. 

In this season 1 was much surprised with the increase of my family; I had 
>ccn concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as 
thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her, till, to my aston- 
J»hnient, she came home about the end of August with three kittens. This was 



64 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

the more strange to me, because, though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it 
with my gun, yet I thought it a quite different kind from our European cat; but 
the young cats were the same kind of house-breed as the old one; and both nij 
cats being females, I thought it very strange. But from these three cats, I after- 
wards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them lik? 
vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible 

From the i4rh of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, 
and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement, I began 
to be straitened for food: but venturing out twice, 1 one day ^killed a goat, 
and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was 
a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for rny 
breakfast; a piece of the goat’s flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled, 
for, to my great misfortune, 1 had no vessel to boil or stew anythhig; and two 
or three of the turtle’s eggs for my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked d^ily two or 
three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one 
side, till 1 came to the outside of the hill, and made a doorway out, which came 
beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I was not 
perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed myself before, I was in a 
perfect enclosure; whereas now% I thought I lay exposed, and open for anything 
to come in upon nic; and } et I could not perceive that there was any living 
thing to fear; the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being 
a goat. 

Sept 50.— I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing. I cast 
up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three hundred and 
sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart for religious 
exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious humiliation, 
confessing my sins to God, acknowledging His righteous judgments upon me, 
and praying to Him to ha\e mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and not having 
tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, e\ en till the going dowm of the 
sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing 
the day as I had began it. I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for as at 
first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted 
to distinguish the wxeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the 
Sabbath-day, and so did not really know w hat any of the days were; but no\^, 
haying cast up the days as above, 1 found I had been there a year; so 1 divided 
it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though 1 found 
at the end of my account, 1 had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A little 
after this, my ink began to fail me, and .so I cont(?ntcd myself to use it more; 
sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable events of my life, with-j 
out continuing a daily memorandum of other tilings. i 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to niCi 
and 1 learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; hut 1 
bought all my experience before I had it, and this 1 am going to relate was one 
of the most discouraging experiments that I made. 

I have mentioned that I had saved the few cars of barley and rice, which 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


65 


had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and I believe 
here were about thirty stalks or rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I 
bought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its southern 
position, going from me. Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as 
could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my 
Tain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would 
lot sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for 
h; so I sowed about two thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each, 
t was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of 
vhat 1 sowed this time came to anything: for the dry months following, the 
larrh having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist 
ts growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and 
hen it grew as if it had been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not 
rrow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, 1 sought for a moister piece 
ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my 
lew bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the 
aTtial equinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to water 
t, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part 
of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, 1 had but a small 
quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of each 
kind. But by this experiment 1 v^as made master of my business, and knew 
pxactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed 
times and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing, 1 made a little discovery, which was of use 
to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began to 
Settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the country 
to iny bower, where, though 1 had not been some months, yet I found all 
things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I had made was not 
billy firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that 
grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as 
li willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. 1 could not 

I ell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and 
^ct very well pleased, to see the young trees grower and 1 pruned them, and 
ed them up to grow as much alike as 1 could; and it is scarce credible how 
leautiful a figure they grew into in three years; so that though the edge made 
k circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees (for such I might 
how call them) soon covered it, and it w'as a complete shade, suflScient to 
lodge Uiider all the dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, 
knd make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle round my wall (I mean that 
^f my first dwelling), w'hich 1 did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double 
cow, at about eight yards’ distance from my first fence, they grew presently,, 
and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a 
defence also, as I shall observe in its order. 

^ 1 found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not 
>nto summer and winter, as m Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry 
Reasons, which were generally thus:— 



.66 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

The half of February, the whole of March, and the half of April— rainy, thi 
sun being then on or near the equinox. 

The half of April, the whole of May, June and July, and the half of Augus 
—dry, the sun being then to the north of the line. 

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half of October- 
rainy, the sun being then come back. 

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, anc 
the half of February— dry, the sun being then to the south of the line. 

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happence 
to blow, but this was the general observation I made. After I had found, b) 
experience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I \ took care tc 
furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be qbliged to gc 
out, and 1 sat wdthin doors as much as possible during the wet months. This 
time I found much employment, and very suitable also for the' time, for 
found great occasion for many things which 1 had no way to fui^ish myself 
with but by hard labor and constant application; particularly I tried man) 
ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose 
proved so brittle that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage 
to me now, that w hen 1 was a boy, 1 used to take great delight in standing at 
a basket-maker's, in the towm where my father lived, to see them make their 
wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very ollicious to helj^, and a great 
observer of the manner in which they worked thovse things, and sometimes 
lending a hand, 1 had l)\ these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and 
1 wanted nothing but the materials, w hen it came into my mind that the twigs 
of that tree from whence 1 cut my stakes that grew miglit possibly be as tough 
as the sallow’^s, willow^s, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try. Accord- 
ingly, the next day 1 wxnt to my country-house, as I called it, and cutting some 
of the smaller tw igs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire; 
whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quan- 
tity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. These I set up to 
dry within my circle or hedge, and w’hen they w'cre fit for use, I carried them 
to my cave; and here, during the next season, I employed myself in making, as 
well as 1 could, a great many baskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay 
up anything, as I had occasion; and though 1 did not finish them very hand- 
somely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; and thus, 
afterwards, I took care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware de- 
cayed, I made more, especially strong deep baskets to place my com in, instead 
of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed st world of time about it, I 
bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two w^ants. I had no vessel 
to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, w^hich were almost full 
of rum, and some glass bottles,— some of the common size, and others which 
were case-bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits, &c. I had not so 
much as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I saved out of the 
ship, and which was too big for such as I desired it, viz.; to make broth, iiud 
stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I fain would have had was a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 67 

.acco-pipc, but it was impossible to me to make one; however, I found a 
itrivance for that, too, at last. I employed myself in planting my* second rows 
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry season, 
len another business took me up more time than it could be imagined I 
jld spare. 

mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and that 
ad travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower, and where 
ad an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved 
travel quite across to the sea-shore on that side; so taking my gun, a hatchet, 
i niy dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two 
cuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began 
^ journey. When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, 
anie within view of the sea to the west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly 
?cried land, —whether an island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very 
rh, extending from the W. to the W, S. W. at a very great distance; by my 
ess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

[ could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than that 
new it must be part of America, and as I concluded, by all my observations, 
1 st be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, 
lerc, if 1 had landed, T had been in a worse condition than I was now; and 
irefore 1 acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which 1 began now 
own and to believe ordered everything for the best; I say 1 quieted my 
nd with this, and left off afflicting m\'self with fruitless wishes of being there. 
Sesides, after some thought upon this affair, 1 considered that if this land 
is the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see some vessel 
iS or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was the savage coast be- 
een the Spanish country and Brazils, where arc found the worst of savages; 
: they are cannibals, or mcn-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the 
man bodies that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations, 1 walked very leisurely forward; I found that side 
the island where I now w as much pleasanter than mine,— the open or savanna 
Ids sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods, I 
V abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one, if possible, to 
ve kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. 1 did, after some pains- 
dng, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and having 
:overed it, 1 brought it home; but it w^as some years before 1 could make 
n speak; however, at last, I taught him to call me by my name very famil- 
ly. bui the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting 
its place. 

1 was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low grounds 
res (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed greatly from all 
e other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though 
filled several. But I had no need to be venturous, for I had no want of food, 
d of that which was very good, too, especially these three sorts, viz,: goats, 
^eons, and turtle, or tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall Market 
not have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company; 



68 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thantfu 
ness, that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had rather pie 
even to dainties. 

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or then 
abouts; but I took so many turns and returns to see what discoveries I cou 
make, that I came weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down i 
night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with 
row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from one tree to another, ors 
as no wild creature could come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see i(hat I had tak, 
up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed! the shore 
covered with innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other side l\had found ba 
three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of niam 
kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I had not seen befpre, and niani 
of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the names oL except th 
called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my poud 
and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if 1 could, which i 
could better feed on; and though there were many goats here, more than i 
my side the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could co 
near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me much soonei 
than when I was on the hill. 

I confess this side of the cotintry was much pleasanter than mine; but 
I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my habitatioii| 
it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here to be as it we 
upon a journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the shore of thj 
sea towards the east, 1 suppose about twelve miles, and then setting up a grej 
pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home again, and 
the next journey I took should be on the other side of the island east from ni| 
dwelling, and so round rill I came to my post again. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinldng I could casili 
keep all the island so much in my view, that I could not miss finding my iifi 
dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself mistaken, for, being con 
about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very large valle; 
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I coulj 
not see which was my way by any direction but that of the sun, nor evef 
then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the da)j 
It happened, to my further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for thre 
or four days while I was in the valley, and not being able to see the sun, 
wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find the r~ 
side, look for my post, and come back the same way 1 went; and then, by caijl 
journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my 
ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy. , 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it, and j 
running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. 1 
a great mind to bring it home if I could, for 1 had often been musing whetk 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 69 

might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, 
hich might supply me when my powder and shot should be all spent. I made 
collar for this little creature, and with a string, which I made of some rope- 
urn, which 1 always carried about me, I led him along, though with some diffi- 
Jty, till I came to my bower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I 
as very impatient to be at home, from whence 1 had been absent above a 
onth. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old hutch, 
id lie down in my hammock bed. This little wandering journey, without set- 
ed place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I 
died it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it 
indercd everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved 1 would never 
) a great way from it again, while it should be my lot to stay on the island. 
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long jour- 

| ;y; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of 
aking a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to be 
ell acquainted w'ith me. Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had 
jnned in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, or give 
some food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed 
I could noi get out, but was almost starved for want of food, I went and cut 
0ughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, 
tid having fed it, 1 tied it as 1 did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame 
rich being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like 
dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and 
) fond, that it became from that time one of my domestics also, and would 
e\er leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the 
)th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the anniversary 
r my landing on the island, having now been there two years, and no more 
rospect of being delivered than the first day I came there. I spent the whole 
ly in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies 
hich my solitary condition was attended with, and without which it might 
ive been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that God 
id been pleased to discover to me that it w^as possible I might be more happy 
this solitary condition, than I should have been in the liberty of society, and 
all the pleasures of the world: that he ct>uld fully make up to me the defi- 
mcics of my solitary state, and the want of human society, by his presence, 
id the communications of his grace to my soul; supporting, comforting, and 
icouraging me to depend upon his providence here, and hope for his eternal 
csence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life I 
iw led was, wdth all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, 
ommable life I led all the past part of my days; and now 1 changed both my 
throws and my joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed their 
Sts, and my delights w^rc perfectly new from what they were at my first 
niing, or, indeed, for the two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the country, 
the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden, 
and my very heart would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountain^ 
the deserts 1 was in, and how 1 was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal barj 
and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption, h 
the midst of the greatest composure of my mind, this would break out upop 
me like a storm, and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child; some, 
times it would take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediatelj 
sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or twp together; and 
this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, br vent mvself 
by words, it would go off, and the grief, having cvhausted itself, would abate 

Bur now 1 began to e\crcise myself w'ith new thoughts; 1 daily Wad the \v(^rd 
of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state. One morning, 
being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words: “J will neveV, never leave 
thee, nor forsake thee.” Immediately it occurred that these words were to me, 
why else should they be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when I 
was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man? “Well, 
then,” said 1, “if God does not forsake me, of w^hat ill consequence can it he, 
or what matters it, though the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other i 
hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God.! 
there would be no comparison in the loss?” j 

From this moment, I began to conclude in my mind, that it w^as possible 
for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was prob- 
able 1 should ever ha\e been in any other particular state in the world; and 
with this thought I w'as going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this 
place. I know not w hat it w^as, but something shocked my mind at that thought, 
and I durst not speak the words. “How canst thou become such a hypocrite,” 
said I, even audibly, “to pretend to be thankful for a condition, which, how- 
ever thou mayst endeavor to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heart- 
ily to be delivered from?” So I stop}>ed there; but though I could not sa\ 1 
thanked God for being there, yet 1 sincerely gave thanks to (jod for opening 
my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my 
life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent, I never opened the Bible, 
or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend 
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and 
for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, 1 began my third year; and though I 
have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my worlds 
this year as the first, yet in general it may be observed, that I was very seldom 
idle, but having regularly divided my time according to the several daily em- 
ployments that were before me, such as, first, my duty to God, and the reading 
the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice every day? 
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up 
three hours m every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, cur- 
ting, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught n>r my supply*' 
took up great part of the day; also, it is to be considered, that in the middle of 



71 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


[e day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great 
) stir^out; so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I could 
b supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my 
ours of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad 
nth my gun in the afternoon. 

' To this short time allowed for labor, I desire may be added the exceeding 
tboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of tools, want of 
elp, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time; for example^ 
;was full two and forty days in making a board for a long shelf, which I 
knted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would 
sive cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. 

; My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down, 
ecause my board was to be a broad one. This tree I v as three days in cutting 
own, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece 
f timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of 
: into chips till it began to be light enough to move; then I turned it, and 
lade one side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end; then turning 
iiat side downward, cut the other side till I brought the plank to be about 
aree inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labor of 
ly hands in such a piece of work; but labor and patience carried me through 
bat, and many other things; I only observe this in particular, to show tne 
eason why so much of my time went away with so little work, viz.: that what 
[light be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labor and required 
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But notwithstanding this, with 
laticncc and labor I got through everj^hing that my circumstances made 
lecessary to me to do, as will appear by what follow^s. 


; 1 was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop 
if barley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up for them was not 
[reat; for, as I observed, my seed of each w as not above the quantity of half a 
feck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season: but now my 
irop promised very well, when on a sudden 1 found I was in danger of losing 
t all again by enemies of several sorts, which it w^as scarcely possible to keep 
jroni it; as, first the goats, and w ild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting 
lie sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and 
te it so close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk. 

This I saw no remedy for, l)ut by making an enclosure about it wdth a hedge; 
i^hich T did with a great deal of toil, and the more because it required speed, 
iowever, as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally 
i^ell fenced in about three weeks’ time; and .shooting some of the creatures in 
le daytime, 1 set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at 
he gate, where he would stand and bark all night long: so in a little time the 
nemies forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began 
0 ripen apace. 

But as tne beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so the 
ttrds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for going along 
y the place to sec how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls. 





WORKS OF DANIFX DEFOK 


of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I shoulj 
be gone. I immediately let fly among them, for I always had my ^n with me 
I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not 
seen at all, from among the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they wouij 
devour all my hopes; that 1 should be starved, and never be able to raise a cro; 
at all; and what more to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not to lose mj 
corn,’ if possible, though I should uatch it night and day. In the first place, li 
went among it, to see what damage was already done, and found they had 
spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green for thdp, the loss was 
not so great but that the remainder was likely to be a good cibp, if it could 
be saved. \ 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could ^easily see the 
thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only wai^d till I was 
gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked off, as if I was 
gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, than they dropped down one by one 
into the corn again. I w as so provoked, that I could not have patience to sta) 
till more came on, knowing that every grain that they ate now was, as it might 
be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I 
fired again, and killed three of them. I'his w as w hat 1 wished for; so 1 tool 
them up, and served them as wc serve notorious thieves in England— hanged 
them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to invaginc that this 
should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not comeat 
the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island, and I could 
never see a bird near the place as long as my scare-crows hung there. This I 
was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end of December, 
which was our second harvest of the year, 1 reaped my corn. | 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I could do 
was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the broadswords, or cutlas^es, 
which I saved among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop wai 
but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down; in short, 1 reaped it in my 
way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it aw ay in a great basket 
which 1 had made, and so rubbed it out w ith my hands; and at the end of all 
my harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of seed I had near two bushels 
of rice, and about two bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my gucsSi 
for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in rime,, 
it would please God to supply me with bread: and yet, here I was pcrjdexcu 
again, for I neither knew how to grind, or make meal of my corn, or indeed, 
how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it, 
and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it; these things being added 
to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a constant 
supply, 1 resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed 
against the next season; and, in the mean time, to employ all my study ttjid 
hours of working to accomplish this great work of providing myself 
com and bread. r b r & /

•ROBINSON CRUSOE 

it might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. I believe few people 
ire thought much upon the strange multitude of little things necessary in the 
jviding, producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of 
:ad. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to nty daily dis- 
uragement, and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after I had 
t the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, 

J indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade or shovel to dig it. 
ell, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed before; 
t this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a great 
iny days to make it, yet for want of iron, it not only wore out soon, but 
ide my work the harder, and made it be performed much worse. However, 
s I bore with, and was content to work it out with patience, and bear with 
: badness of the performance. When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, 
t was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree 
cr it, to scratch it as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it 
IS growing, and grown, I have observed already how many things I wanted 
fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it 
)m the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, 
ast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; but all these things 
lid without, as shall be seen; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort 
d advantage to me too. All this, as 1 said, made everything laborious and 
lious to me: but that there was no help for; neither was my time so much 
»s to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day 
pointed to these works; and as 1 had resolved to use none of the corn for 
ead till 1 had a greater quantity by me, 1 had the next six months to apply 
/self wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper 
r the performing all the operations necessary for making the corn, when I 
d it fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow 
ove an acre of ground. Before I did this, 1 had a week’s work at least to 
ike me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and 
ry heavy, and required double labor to work with it. However, I got 
rough that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my 
>use as 1 could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, 
e stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had set before, and 
lew It would grow; so that, in one year’s time, I knew I should have a quick 
living hedge, that would want but little repair. This work did not take me 
> less than three njonths, because a great part of that time was the wet season, 
hen 1 could not go abroad. Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could 
‘t go out, I found employment in the following occupations,— always observ- 
g, that all the while I was at work, 1 diverted myself with talking to my 
trot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught him to know his own 
jrne, and at last to speak it out pretty loud, Poll, which was the first word I 
er heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This, therefore,

was not my work, but an assistance to my work; for now, as I said, I had 
great employment upon my hands, as follows: 1 had long studied to make b 
some means or other, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted soreb 
but knew not where to come at them. However, considering the heat of tb 
climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might make soir 

E ots that might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough 
ear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept ^ 
and as this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal, &c., which was the thii 
I was doing, I resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stai 
like jars, to hold what should be put into them. j 

It would make the reader pity me, or laugh at me, to tell htaw many awl 
ward ways 1 took to raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly\things 1 made 
how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay hot being stif 
enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked b}^ the ovar-vioicnt hci 
of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell in piec^es with onh 
removing, as well before as after they were dried; and, in a word, how, aftti 
having labored hard to find the clay— to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home 
and work it— I could not make above two large earthen ugly things (1 canno 
call them jars) in about two months’ labor. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, 1 lifted them verj 
gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which 1 ha! 
made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as between the po 
and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice am 
barley straw; and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought woul 
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn ^;v'as bruised. 

Though 1 miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made seven 
smaller things with better success; such as little round pots, fiat dishes, pitcher! 
and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun halve 
them quite hard. 

But all this w^ould not answer my end, which w^as to get an earthen pot r 
hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could do. 
happened after some time, making a prett}^ large fire for cooking my mes 
when 1 went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken piece < 
one of my earthen-ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and ri 
a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that certainly 
might be made to burn whole, if they would burn broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some poi 
I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters bum in, or of glazing them vii 
lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I placed three large pipkins, ai 
two or three pots, in a pile, one upon another, and placed my nrewood 5 
around it with a great heap of embers under them, I plied the fire with fre 
fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the insi 
red-hot qmte through, and observed that they did not crack at all; wheii 
saw them clear red, 1 let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, til 
found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the 
which was jrdxed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat, and woi 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 75 

[lave run into glass if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the 
pots began to abate of the red color, and watching them all night, that I might 
not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning 1 had three very good (I will not 
5 ,ay handsome) pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burned as could 
be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that 1 wanted no sort of earthen-ware 
for my use; but I must needs say as to the shapes of them, they were very 
indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of making them but 
as the children make dirt pies or as a woman would make pies that never 
learned to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I found 
I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and 1 had hardly patience 
to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the fire again, with some water 
in it, to boil me sonic meat, v hich it did admirably well; and with a piece of 
a kid I made some very good broth, though T v anted oatmeal, and several 
other ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would have had it been. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn 
in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that perfection of art 
with one pair of hands. To supply this want, 1 was at a great loss; for, of all 
the trades in the world, I was as perfectly unejualified for a stonecutter, as for 
any whatever; neither had 1 any tools to go about it with. T spent many a day 
to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, 
and could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had 
no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness 
sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which neither would bear 
the weight of a heavy pestle, nor w ould break the corn without filling it with 
sand; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, 
and resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed 
much easier; and getting one as big as 1 had strength to stir, I rounded it, and 
formed it on the outside w ith my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of 
fire, and infinite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make 
their canoes. After this, T made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood 
called the iron-wood; and this 1 prepared and laid by against I had my next 
crop of corn, which 1 proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, into meal, 
to make bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or scarce, to dress my meal, and to 
part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see it possible I 
could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, even to think on, for to 
be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean fine thin 
canvas, or stuff, to scarce the meal through. And here I was at a full stop for 
many months; nor did 1 really know what to do. Linen I had none left but 
what was mere rags; I had goat’s-hair, but neither knew how to weave it or 
spin it; and had 1 known how, here were no tools to work it with. All the 
remedy that 1 found for this was, that at last 1 did remember I had, among the 
seamen’s clothes which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico 
or muslin; and with some pieces of these I made three small sieves proper 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


76 

enough for the work; and thus I made shift for some years: how I did after, 
wards, I shall show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should 
make bread when 1 came to have corn; for, first, 1 had no yeast; as to that part, 
there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself much about it. 
But for an oven, 1 was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an experi* 
ment for that also, which was this: I made some earthen vessels very broad, but 
not deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches 
deep; these I burned in the fire, as 1 had done the other, and laid them b) , 
and when I wanted to bake, I make a great fire upon my hearth, jwhich I had 
paved with some square tiles, of my own baking and burning; also; but 1 
should not call them square. \ 

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or l^vc coals, I 
drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and\ there 1 let 
them lie till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away all the cn^bers, I set 
down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew 
the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat, 
and thus, as well as in the best oven m the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and 
became, in little time, a good pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made myself 
several cakes and puddings of the rice; but 1 made no pies, neither had I any- 
thing to put into them, supposing 1 had, except the flesh cither of fowls 
or goats. 

It need not be w^ondered at, if all these things took me up most part of the 
third year of my abode here; for, it is to be observed, that in the intervals of 
these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage; for 1 reaped niv 
corn in its season, and carried it home as well as 1 could, and laid it up in the 
ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for 1 had no floor to 
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build m) 
barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of the corn 
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and 
of the rice as much, or more; insomuch that now 1 resolved to begin to use 
it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great w hile; also I resolved to 
see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but 
once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were 
much more than I could consume in a year: so I resolved to sow just the same 
quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity 
would fully provide me with bread, &c. 

All the while these things were doing, you may he sure my thoughts ran 
many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other side of 
the island; and I was not without secret wishes that I were on shore there, 
fancying that, seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, 1 might find 
some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some 
means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an under- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 77 

raking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I 
night have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa: that if 
[ once came in their power, 1 should run a hazard of more than a thousand to 
3 ne of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people 
Df the Caribbean coast were cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the 
;atitudc that I could not be far from that shore. Then, supposing they were not 
:annibals, yet they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their 
lands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty together—much 
more I, that was but one, and could make little or no defence; all these things, 
f say, which I ought to have considered well, and did come into my thoughts 
afterwards, yet gave me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily 
upon the thought of getting over to the shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder-of- 
Tuitton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; 
3 Ut this was in vain: then I thought I would go and look at our ship’s boat, 
tvhich, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, 
ivhen we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not 
^uite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom 
jpward, against a high ridge of beachy, rough sand, but no water about her. 
If 1 had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into the 
;vatcr, the boat would have done well enough, and 1 might have gone back into 
the Brazils with her easily enough; but 1 might have foreseen that I could no 
more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove 
:he island; however, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and 
brought them to the boat, resolving to try wdiat 1 could do; suggesting to 
myself, that if I could but turn her dowm, I might repair the damage she had 
received, and she would be a very good boat, and 1 might go to sea in her 
very easily. 

I spared no })ains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I think, 
three or four weeks about it; at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with 
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine it, and so to 
make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the 
fall 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get under 
it, much less to move it forw^ard towards the water; so 1 w^as forced to give it 
over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture 
over the main increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed 
impossible. 

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make 
myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make, even 
'vithout tools, or, as 1 might say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree. 
This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with 
the thoughts of making it, and with my having much more convenience for it 
than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the particular 
inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz.: want of 
hands to move it, when it was made, into the water— a difficulty much harder 



WORKS OF DANTFL DRFOK 


for roe to surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to 
dbero; for what was it to me, if when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, 
and with much trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools to hew 
and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the 
inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it—if, after all this, I roust 
leave it just there where I found it, and not be able to launch it into the water^ 

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon my 
mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but I should have 
immediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my thoughts weie 
so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once considered how 
I should get it off the land: and it was really, in its own nature, rrtore easy for 
me to guide it over forty-five miles in sea, than about forty-fivc\ fathoms of 
land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water, \ 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever mati did, who 
had any of his senses awake. 1 pleased myself with the design, without deter- 
mining whether 1 was ever able to undertake it; not but that the dilBculty of 
launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a stop to my inquiries 
into it, by this foolish answer, which I gave myself: “Let me first make it; I 
warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when it is done.” ^ 

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy pre- 
vailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, and 1 question much whether 
Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple of Jerusalem; it 
was five feet ten inches diameter at the lover part next the stump, and four 
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it 
lessened for a while, and tlicn parted into branches. It was not without infinite 
labor that I felled tliis tree; I w^as tw^enty days hacking and hewdng at it at the 
bottom; 1 was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the vast 
spreading head, cut off, w^hich I hacked and hewed through with axe and 
hatchet, and inexpressible labor; after this, it cost me a month to shape it and 
dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it 
might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three months more tc 
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it: this 1 did 
indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labor 
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to have 
carried six and twenty men, and consequently big enough to have carried me 
and all my cargo. 

When 1 had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it. The 
boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua, that was 
made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be 
sure; and had 1 gotten it into the water, 1 make no question but I should have 
begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that cvei 
was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost me 
infinite labor too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water, and not 
more; but first inconvenience w^as, it was up hill towards the creek. Well 
to take away this discouragement, 1 resolved to dig into the surface of the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 79 

earth, and so make a declivity: this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of 
pains (but who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view? ); but when 
this was worked through, and this diflSiculty managed, it was still much the 
same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I 
measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring 
the water up to the canoe, seeing 1 could not bring the canoe down to the 
water. Well, I began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and 
calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be 
tluown out, 1 found that, by the number of hands 1 had, being none but my 
own, it must hvive been ten or twelve years before 1 could have gone through 
with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been at 
least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this 
attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of begin- 
ning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our 
own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work 1 finished my fourth )ear in this place, and kept 
niy anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever 
before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the Word of God, 
and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different knowledge from what 
I had before. I entertained different notions of things. I looked now upon the 
world as a thing remote, w^hich I had nothing to do with, no expectation from, 
and, indeed, no desires about: in a word, 1 had nothing indeed to do with it, 
nor was ever likely to have; so 1 thought it looked, as we may perhaps look 
upon it hereafter, viz.: as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and 
well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, “Between me and thee is a great 
gulf fixed.” 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world here; 
I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, or the pride of life. I 
had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now capable of enjoying; I was 
lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor 
over the whole country which I had possession of; there were no rivals; I had 
no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command with me: 1 might have 
raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as 1 
thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and 
then one was as much as 1 could put to any use; I had timber enough to have 
huilt a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have 
cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built. 

But all I could make use of was ail that was valuable: I had enough to eat 
and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed more flesh 
than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if 1 sowed more corn than I 
could cat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the 
ground; I could make no more use of them but for fuel, and that I had no 
occasion for but to dress my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just 
, J'cflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther good to us than

they are for our use; and that whatever we may heap up to give others, we 
enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous, griping 
miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had 
been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with. 
I had no room for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they 
were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, 
a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. 
Alas! there the sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business for it; and 
often thought with myself, that I would have given a handful of it for a gross 
of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have 
given it all for a sixpenny worth of turnip and carrot seed out ctf England, or 
for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, 1 had not the 
least advantage by it or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawipr, and grew 
mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I '^ad had the 
drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case— they had 'been of no 
manner of value to me, because of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it was at 
first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently sat down 
to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of Clod’s providence, which 
had thus spread my table in tiie wilderness. I learned to look more upon the 
bright side of my condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider whar 
I enjoyed rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret 
comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take notice of here, to pur 
those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what 
God has given them, because they see and covet something that He has not 
given them. All our discontents about what w'c w ant appeared to me to spring 
from the want of thankfulness for whar we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to 
any one that should fall into such distreSsS as mine was; and this was, to coin' 
pare my present condition with what I at first expected it would be; nay, with 
what it would certainly have been, if the good providence of Gt)d had not 
wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not 
only could come at her, but could bring what 1 got out of her to the shore, for 
my relief and comfort; without which, 1 had wanted for tools to work, 
weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself, in the 
most lively colors, how I must have acted if I had got nothing out of the 
ship; how I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and turtles, 
and that, as it was long before I found any of diem, 1 must have perished 
first; that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage; that if 
I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, J liad no way to flay or open 
it, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must 
gnaw It with my teeth and pull it with my claws, like a beast. 

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence to 
me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships and 
misfortunes: and this part also 1 cannot but recommend to the reflection cf 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 81 

those who are apt, in their misery, to say, “Is any ajffiction like mine?*' Let 
them consider how much worse the cases of some people are, and their case 
might have been, if Providence had thought fit. 

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind with 
hopes; and this was comparing my present situation with what I had deserved, 
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence. I had lived a 
dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had been 
well instructed by father and mother; neither had they been wanting to me, 
in their early endeavors to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense 
of my duty, and what the nature and end of my being required of me. But 
alas! falling early into the seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most desti- 
tute of the fear of God, though His terrors are always before them; I say, 
falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that little 
sense of religion which 1 had entertained was laughed out of me by my mess- 
mates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death, which grew 
habitual to me; by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to 
converse with anything but what was like myself, or to hear anything that was 
good, or tended towards it. 

So void was 1 of everything that was good, or the least sense of what I was, 
or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed— such as my escape 
from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese master of the ship; my being 
planted so wxll in the Brazils; my receiving the cargo from England, and the 
like— I never had once the words, “Thank God,” so much as on my mind, or 
in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray 
to I lim, or so much as to say, “Lord, have mercy upon me!” no, nor to mention 
the name of God, unless it was to swear by and blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have already 
observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I looked 
about me, and considered what particular providences had attended me since 
my coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me,— 
had not only punished me less than my iniquity had deserved, but had so 
plentifully provided for me, this gave me great hopes that my repentance was 
accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for me. 

With these reflections, 1 worked my mind up, not only to a resignation to 
the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but even to a 
sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, w'ho was yet a living man, 
ought not to complain, seeing 1 had not the due punishment of my sins; that I 
<*nioycd so many mercies which 1 had no reason to have expected in that place; 
that 1 ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give 
daily thanks for that daily bread which nothing but a crowd of wonders could 
have brought; that 1 ought to consider 1 had been fed even by a miracle, even 
as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; 
and that I could hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the 
world where I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as 
1 had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so 1 found no ravenous 
beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous creatures, 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

or poisons, which I might feed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and 
devour me. In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a lift 
of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but tc 
be able to make my sense of God’s goodness to me, and care over me in thii 
condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a just improvement 
of these things, I went away, and was no more sad. I had now been here sc 
long, that many things which 1 had brought on shore for my help were eithci 
quite gone, or very much wasted and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little, whicl 
I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so pale, it scarce left any 
appearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted 1 made use of it to 
minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened 
to me; and first, by casting up times past, 1 remembered that \thcre was a 
strange concurrence of days in the various providences which b^ell me, and 
which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or 
fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a gfeat deal of 
curiosity. 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away from my father and 
friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards 
I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave; the same day of the 
year that I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that 
same day year afterwards 1 made my escape from Sallee in a boat; the same 
day of the year 1 was born on, viz.: the 30th of September, that same day 1 had 
my life so miraculously saved twxnty-six years after, when 1 W’as cast on shore 
in this island; so that my wdeked life and my solitary life began both on a day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread; I mean the 
biscuit which I brought out of the ship: this 1 had husbanded to the last degree, 
allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a year; and yet 1 was 
quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and 
great reason I had to be thankful that 1 had any at all, the getting it being, as 
has been already observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had none a good while 
except some checkered shirts which I found in the chests of the other seamen, 
and which I carefully preserved; because many times I could bear no other 
clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had, among 
all the men’s clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. There were also 
indeed, several thick watch-coats of the seamen’s which were left, but the) 
were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the weather was so violcnrlj 
hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked,— no 
though 1 had been inclined to it, which 1 was not;— nor could I abide tbt 
thought of it, though 1 was alone. The reason why 1 could not go naked was 
I could not bear the heat of the sun so wxll w^hen quite naked as with some 
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a 
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, wa‘ 

^ ^»Wofold cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go ou 
in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; the heat of the sun, beating witl 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 83 

och violence as it does in that place, would give me the headache presently, 
y darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could 
lOt bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away. 

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had, 
^rhich I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoats I 
lad, and my business was now to try if I could not make jackets out of the 
vatch-coats which I had by me, and with such other materials as I had; so I 
et to work tailoring, or rather, indeed, botching, for I made most piteous work 
>f it. However, I made shift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I 
loped would serve me a great while; as for breeches or drawers, 1 made but a 
rciy sorry shift indeed till afterwards. 

1 have mentioned that 1 saved the skins of all the creatures that I killed, I 
riean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up stretched out with sticks in 
:he sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard that they were 
5t for little, but others were very useful. The first thing 1 made of these was 
i great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain; 
and this 1 performed so well, that after, I made me a suit of clothes wholly of 
these skins,— that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and 
both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me 
uarni. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for 
if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. 1 lowever, they were such as I 
[iiade very good shift with, and when 1 was out, if it happened to rain, the 
hair of my waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry. 

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella; I was 
indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had seen 
them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great heats there, 
and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the 
equinox; besides, as 1 was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful 
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats, I took a world of pains with it, 
and was a great while before 1 could make anything likely to hold: nay, after 
1 thought I had hit the way, 1 spoiled two or three before I made one to my 
mind: but at last I made one that answered indifferently well; the main diffi^ 
culty I found was to make it let dowm. I could make it spread, but if it did not 
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but just over 
my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to 
answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the 
rain like a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that 1 could walk 
out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in 
the coolest, and when I had no need of it, could close it, and carry it under 
tuy arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by 
resigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the 
disposal of His providence. This made my life better than sociable, for when 
1 began to regret the want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus 
conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope 1 may say) with 



WORKS OF nAKTFT. DFFOF 


even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the utmost enjoymcni 
of human society in the world? 

1 cannot say that, after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing happenee 
to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture and place, aj 
before; the chief things I was employed in, besides my yearly labor of planting 
my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which 1 always kept up jua 
enough to have sufficient stock of one year’s provision beforehand; I sa) 
besides this yearly labor, and my daily pursuit of going out with my gun, ■ 
had one labor, to make a canoe, which at last I finished; so that, by digging; 
canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, 1 brought it into the creek 
almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, jfor I made ii 
without considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be able tc 
launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water, or bring tlie water t( 
it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum tq teach me tr 
be wiser the next time: indeed, the next time, though 1 could npt get a tre; 
proper for it, and was in a place where I could not get the watcj^^ to it at am 
less distance than, as 1 have said, near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable 
at kvSt, I never gave it over; and though I was near two years about it, )et 
never grudged my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, } ct the size of it which 1 
had in view when I made the first; I mean of vcTituring over to the terra firma, 
where it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat 
assisted to put an end to that design, and now 1 thought no more of it. As I ha<‘ 
a boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I had 
been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already described it, 
over the land, so the discoveries 1 made in that little journey made me very 
eager to see other parts of the coast; and now 1 had a boat, 1 thought of 
nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, that 1 might do everything with discretion and considera- 
tion, 1 fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail too out of some of 
the pieces of the ship’s sails which lay in store, and of which 1 had a great 
stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, 1 found she 
would sail very well; then I made little lockers, or boxes, at each end of niv 
boat, to put provisions, necessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, 
either from rain or the spray of the sea; and a little, long, hollow place 1 cut in 
the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang dew 
over it, to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to stand over rr 
head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I every no 
and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor fai 
from the little creek. At last, being eager to view the circumference of niy 
little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise; and accordingly I victualled my shif 
for the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes 1 should rather cal 
them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a grcai 
deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for kUli ' 
more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I ^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 85 

Lved out of the seamen’s chests: these I took, one to He upon, and the other 
p cover me in the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my captivity, 
ji^hich you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer 
han 1 expected; for though the island itself was not very large, yet when I 
^nie to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two 
kgues into the sea, some above water, some under it; and beyond that a shoal 
If sand, lying dry half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way 
lut to sea to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, 1 was going to give over my enterprise, and 
oiTie back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea; 
nd, above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came to an anchor; 
)r 1 had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which 
[ got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a 
lill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of it. 
Hid rcsf)lvcd to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, T perceived a strong, and, 
ndecd, a most furious current, which ran to the east, and even came close to 
he point; and I took the more notice of it, because 1 saw there might be some 
langer, that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength 
)f it, and not be able to make the island again: and, indeed, had 1 not got first 
ipon this hill, 1 believe it would have been so; for there was the same current 
)n the other side the island, only that it set off at a farther distance, and I saw 
here was a strong eddy under the shore; so 1 had nothing to do but to get out 
)f the first current, and 1 should presentl) be in an eddy. 

1 lay here, howx’ver, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at 
1 . S. E., and that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach of 
he sea upon the point; so that it w^as not safe for me to keep too close to the 
horc for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the sea 
vas calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash and ignorant pilots; 
or no sooner was I come to the point, when 1 v^ as not even my boat's length 
rom the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current like 
he sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along with it with such violence that 
ill I could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but 1 found it 
lurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, whicli was on my left hand. 
Hicre was no wdnd stirring to help me, and all 1 could do with my paddles 
iignifiod nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost; for as the 
-urrent was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues’ distance they 
nust join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did 1 sec any possibility 
>f avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the 
ca, for that was calm enough, but of starving from hunger. 1 had, indeed, 
ound a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into 
he boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen 
'ots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be 



86 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues at least? 

And now 1 saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even the 
most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon rt\y 
desolate, solitary island, as the most pleasant place in the world, and all the 
happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again. I stretched out 
my hands to it, with eager wishes: “O happy desert!” said I, “I shall never see 
thee more. O miserable creature! v/hithcr am I going?” Then I reproached 
myself with my unthankful temper, and that I had repined at my solitary 
condition; and now what would I give to be on shore there again! Thus, we 
never see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its con- 
traries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the w^nt of it. It is 
scarcely possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven from 
my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, 
almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering in again. How- 
ever, I worked hard till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept 
my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the side of \ the current 
which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as th6 sun passed 
the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up 
from S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in about 
half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time, I had got at a 
frightful distance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather 
intervened, I had been undone another way, too; for 1 had no compass on 
board, and should never have known how to have steered towards the island, 
if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied 
myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north 
as much as possible, to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, I saw 
even by the clearness of the w^ater some alteration of the current was near; for 
where the current was so strong the water w^as foul; but perceiving the water 
clear, I found the current abate: and presently I found to the cast, at about half 
a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks; these rocks 1 found caused the 
current to part again, and as the main stress of it ran aw^ay more southerl\, 
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the 
rocks, and made a strong eddy, w^hich ran back again to the north-west, with 
a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the 
ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who have 
been in such extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, and 
how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also 
freshening, how gladly 1 spread my sail to it, riftining cheerfully before the 
wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, directly towards 
the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the current 
which carried me away at first, so that when I came near the island, I found 
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the, 
island, opposite to that which 1 went out from. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 87 

When I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this 
xrent or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther. However, 
id that being between two great currents, viz.: that on the south side, 
1 had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay about a league 
1 the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I found 
le water at least still, and running no way; and having still a breeze of wind 
if for me, 1 kept on steering directly for the island, though not making 
ich fresh way as I did before. 

About four o’clock in the evening, being then within a league of the island, 
found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster, stretching out, 

; is described before, to the southward, and casting off the current more 
(Utherly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north; and this I found 
jry strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was due 
cst, but almost full north. However, having a fredi gale, I stretched across 
lis eddy, slanting north-west; and in about an hour came within about a mile 
: the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land. 

When 1 was on shore, 1 fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my 
bverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; 
d refreshing myself with such things as 1 had, I brought my boat close to 
ic shore, in a bttle cove that 1 had spied under some trees, and laid me down 
) sleep, being quite spent wuth the labor and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss w^hich way to get home with my boat! I had run 
) much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting it by 
»e way I went out; and wdiat might be at the other side (I mean the west side) 
knew not, nor had 1 any mind to run any more ventures: so I resolved on the 
xt morning to make my way westward along the shore, and to see if there 
IS no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her 
ain, if I wanted her. In about three mUes, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, 
came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till I 
inie to a very little rivulet or brook, where 1 found a very convenient harbor 
)r my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on 
irpose for her. Here 1 put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on 
3re to look about me, and see where 1 was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been before, 
^hen I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat but 
iy gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way 
^as comfortable enough after such a voyage as 1 had been upon, and I reached 
ly old bower in the evening, where I found everything standing as I left it; 

I always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my country-house. 
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs, for 1 
^as very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you can, that read my story, 
fhat a surprise 1 must be in when I was awakened out of my sleep by a voice, 
illing me by my name several times, “Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe: poor 
obin Crusoe! Where arc you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have 
pu been?” 

^ Was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or paddling as it is

called, the first part of the day, and with walking the latter part, that 1 did noi 
wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed 
that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat, “Robin 
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,” at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at 
first dreadfully frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation; but no 
sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, 
and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in such be. 
moaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and he had learned 
it so perfectly that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to 
face, and cry, “Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you bcen^ 
How came you here?” and such things as I had taught him. j 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could be 
nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose mysaf. First, I 
amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he should j^t keep about 
the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well satisfied it would be nobody but 
honest Poll, I got over it; and holding out my hand, and calling him by 
name, “Poll,” the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he 
used to do, and continued talking to me, “Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I 
come here? and where had I been?” just as if he had been overjoyed to see me 
again; and so 1 carried him home along wdth me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough i 
do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been m. 1 
would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the 
island; but I knew not how it was practical to get it about. As to the east side 
of the island w hich I had gone round, I knew \\ ell enough there was no ventur- 
ing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my verj' blood run chill, bur to 
think of it; and as to the other side of the island, 1 did not know how it mighl 
be there; but supposing the current ran wdth the same force against the shor« 
at the east as it passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of heinj 
driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before ot 
being carried aw ay from it. So w ith these thoughts, I contented myself to be 
without any boat, though it had been the product of so many months’ labor t 
make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. 

In this government of my temper, I remained near a year; and lived a ver) 
sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose, and my thoughts being verj 
much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning iu)sel 
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought 1 lived really very happily in ^ 
things, except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my nec 
skies put me upon applj ing myself to; and 1 bdieve I should, upon occasio 
have made a very good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen- ware, af 
contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, w^hich I found infinitely 
easier and better; because 1 made things round and shaped, which before wer 
filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain of my 
performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than for my being al^l|

make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it 
s done, and only burned red, like other earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and 
n, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I 
1 been always used to smoke; and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot 
xn at first, not thinking that there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, 
len 1 searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes, 
n my wicker-ware, also, I improved much, and made abundance of neces- 
y baskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome, 

: they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things up in, 
fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang 
jp in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a 
ket; and the like by a turtle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a 
ce or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in 
)askct, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets were the 
eivers of my corn, w^hich I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and 
•cd, and kept it in great baskets. 

began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want 
ich It was impossible for me to supply, and 1 began seriously to consider 
at I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to say, how I 
mid kill any goats. 1 had, as is observed, in the third year of my being here, 
)t a young kid, and bred her up tame, and 1 was in hopes of getting a 
goat: but 1 could not by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an 
1 goat, and as I could never find in my heart to kill her, she died at last of 
re age. 

5ut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said, my 
munition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare the 
Its, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and particularly, 
vanted a she-goat great with young. For this purpose I made snares to 
nper them; and I do believe they were more than once taken in them; but 
^ tackle w^as not good, for 1 had no wire, and I always found them broken, 
1 my bait devoured. At length 1 resolved to try a pitfall: so I dug several 
ge pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats used to feed, 
1 over those pits 1 placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great 
ight upon them; and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without 
ting the trap; and 1 could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and 
en up the corn, for I could sec the marks of their feet. At length, I set three 
ps in one night, and going the next morning, 1 found tliem all standing, and 
r the bait eaten and gone: this w as very discouraging. However, I altered my 
ps, and, not to trouble you w ith particulars, going one morning to see my 
ps, J found in one of them a large old he-goat; and in one of the others 
•ee kids, a male and two females. 

^s to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce, I durst 
t go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring him away alive, which was 
lat I wanted. 1 could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor 
>uld it answer my end; so 1 even let Iiiin out, and he ran away as if he had 
frightened out of his wits. But 1 did not then know what 1 afterwards 



90 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


learned, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three or fo 
days without food, and then have carried him some water to drink, and tl 
a little com, he would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they ar 
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present, I let him go, knowing no better at that time: thei 
I went to the three kids, and, taking them one by one, 1 tied them with string 
together, and with some difficulty brought them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed; but tlirowing them some suet 
corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I found that if 
expected to supply myself with goats’ flesh, when I had no powder or shot left 
breeding some up tame was my only way, when, perhaps, I nlight have then 
about my house like a flock of sheep. But, then, it occurred to iiic that I 
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would alw'ays run w^ld when thq 
grew up; and the only way for this w'as to have some enclosed pi^ce of ground 
.veil fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effcctujdly that thost 
within might not break out, or those without break in. ^ 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands, yet, as 1 saw there wai 
an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find our a proper pieci 
of ground, where there w^as likely to be herbage for them to eat, water foi 
them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. 

Those v/ho understand such enclosures will think I had very little con- 
trivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these (being a plain 
open piece of meadow land, or sa\anna, as our people call it in the western 
colonies), which had two or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one 
end was very woody,— 1 say, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall 
them I began by enclosing this piece of ground in such a manner, that ni\ 
hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about. Nor was the madness 
of it so great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to ha\t 
time enough to do it in; but 1 did not consider that my goats w^ould be as vild 
in so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should ha\eso 
much room to chase them in that I should never catch them. 

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when this 
thought occurred to me; so 1 presently stopped short, and for the beginning, 
1 resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in Icngrli, 
and one hundred yards in breadth, w^hich, as it would niaintam as many as I 
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could add niort 
ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. 1 
about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it, 1 terhered 
the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as 
possible, to make them familiar; and very often I w^ould go and carry them 
some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand, so 
that after my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow 
me U]p and down, bleating after me for a handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of about 
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had tltree and forty, bcsid"* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 91 

/eral that I took and killed for my food. After that, I enclosed five several 
ieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take 
leni as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all; for now I not only had goats’ flesh to fped on when I 
[eased, but milk too, —a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I did not so 
luch as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, was really an 
rceablc surprise, for now 1 set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or 
JO of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to every 
eature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so that had never 
jilked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made only when 
was a boy, after a great many essays and miscarriages, made both butter and 
hecse at last, also salt (though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat 
f the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards, 
ow mercifully can our Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions 
which they seem to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can He sweeten 
le bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and 
risons! What a table w'as here spread for me in the wilderness, where I saw 
othing at first but to perish for hunger. 

It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit 
own to dinner. There w^as my majesty, the prince and lord pf the whole 
iland; I had the lives of ail my subjects at my absolute command; I could hang, 
raw, give liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all my subjects, 
hen, to see how like a king 1 dined, too, all alone, attended by my servants! 
oil, as if he had been my favorite, was the only person permitted to talk to 
e. My dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and had found no 
lecics to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, 
le on one side of the table and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit 
111 my hand, as a mark of especial favor. 

But these were not the tw^o cats w hich I brought on shore at first, for they 
ere both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by my own 
md; bur one of them having multiplied by I know not w hat kind of creature, 
lesc were two wdiich I had preserved tame; whereas the rest ran wild in the 
oods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last, for they would often 
>me into my house, and plunder rne, too, till at last 1 was obliged to shoot 
lem, and did kill a great many; at length they left me. With this attendance 
id in this plentiful manner I lived; neither could 1 be said to want anything 
►ut society; and of that, some time after this, I w^as likely to have much. 

I was something impatient, as 1 have observed, to have the use of my boat, 
lough very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat 
Hitriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times 1 sat myself 
jwii contented enough without her. But 1 had a strange uneasiness in my 
iind to go down to the point of the island, where, as I have said, in niy last 
nible, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set, 
I might sec what I had to do: this inclination increased upon me every 
Vi and at length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of 
5»hore. I did so; but had any one in England met such a man as I was, it

must either have frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I 
frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of 
my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be 
pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:— 

I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat’s skin, with a flap hanging 
down behind, as well to keep 'the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from 
running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the ram 
upon the flesh under the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat’s skin, the shirts coming down to about the 
middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of ithe same; the 
breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hing down such 
a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the\middle of mv 
legs; stockings and shoes 1 had none, but had made me a pair on somethings J 
scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lacc on 
either side like spatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all 
the rest of m)' clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat’s skin dried, which I drew together with tvo 
thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on either side of 
this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and hatchet, one on one 
side, and one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in 
the same manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my 
left arm, hung wo pouches, both made of goat’s skin too, in one of whicli 
hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back 1 carried my basket, and 
on my shoulder my gun, and o\er my head a great clumsy, ugly, goatVskin 
umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about n 
next to my gun. As for ni) face, the color of it was really not so inulatro-bl 
as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nir 
or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow till it 
about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors sufficien 
I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I hi 
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn b 
some Turks at Sallee, for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks die 
of these mustaches, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to ban 
my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous enougf 
and such as in England would have passed for frightful. 

But all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, 1 had so few to observe m< 
that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of that. In this kin 
of dress 1 went my new journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled fit' 
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where Jl first brought my boat to a 
anchor to get upon the rocks; and having no boat now to take care of, 1 ven 
over the land a nearer way to the same height that 1 was upon before, vher 
looking forward to the points of the rocks which lay out, and which I 
obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the 
all smooth and quiet— no rippling, no motion, no current, an^y more there thai 
in any other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved J 
spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tid

id occasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it was, viz.: that the tide 
- ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of waters from some 
eat river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current, and that, 
jcording as the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, 
[is current came nearer, or went farther from the shore; for, waiting there- 
)outs till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb beii^ 
ladc, I plainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran farther off, 
eing near half a league from the shore, whereas in my case it set close upon 
le Store, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at another time 
: would not have done. 

t This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe the 
bing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about 
e island again; but when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had 
kich terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger 1 had been in, 
3iat 1 could not think of it again with any patience, but, on the contrary, I 
:ook up another resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious~and 
his was, that I would build, or rather make, me another periagua or canoe, and 
;o have one for one side of the island, and one for the other. 

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations in 
he island,— one my little fortification or rent, with the wall about it, under 
he rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into 
icvcral apartments, or caves, one within another. One of these, which was the 
inest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification,— that is 
:o say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock,— was all filled up with the 
urge earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and with fourteen or 
iftecn great baskets, which would hold fiv^e or six bushels each, where I laid 
ip my stores of provisions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short 
rom the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles grew 
ill like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so very much, 
bat there was not the least apjiearance, to any one’s view, of any habitation 
iehind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and upon 
ower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-land, which I kept duly cultivated 
ind sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and when- 
ever 1 had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, 1 had my country-seat, and I had now a tolerable plantation 
therp also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, wdiich I kept in 
repair— that is to say, 1 kept the hedge, which encircled it in, constantly fitted 
ip to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the inside. 1 kept the trees, 
^bich at first were no more than stakes, but were now growm very firm and 
fall, always cut, so that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make 
the more agreeable shade, which they did cffcctuall)' to my mind. In the 
rniddle of this I had my tent alw^ays standing, being a piece of a sail spread 
^ver jjoles, set up for that purpose, and wdiich never wanted any repair or 
renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins of 



94 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on 
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved; and a great 
watch-coat to cover me. And here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from 
my chief seat, 1 rook up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my 
goats; and 1 had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this 
ground, I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should breal( 
through, that 1 never left off dll, with infinite labor, I had stuck the outside of 
the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather 
a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand tnrough between 
them; which afterw ards, when those stakes grew, as they all aid in the next 
rainy season, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any 
wall. \ 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that 1 spared no pains to 
bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support, for 
I considered the keeping up a breed of fame creatures thus at my' hand would 
be a living maga/ine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as i 
lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping them in in} 
reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, 
that I might be sure of keeping them together; which, by this method, indeed, 
1 so effectually secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, 1 had 
planted them so \ cry thick, that I w as forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which 1 principally depended 
on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve \er} 
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my w hole diet; and indeed | 
they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and 
refreshing to the last degree. 

As this w as also about half-way between my other habitation and the place 
where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way thither, 
for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all things about, or belong* 
ing to her, in very good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, 
but no more hazardous voyages would I go, scarcely ever above a stone’s cast 
or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of my 
knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any other accident. But now I 
come to a new scene of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly 
surprised with the print of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was very 
plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen 
an apparition. I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, nor 
see anything; I went up to a rising ground, to look farther; I went up the .shore, 
and down the shore, but it was all one: I could see no other impression but that 
one. I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it inig^^ 
not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was exactly the 
print of a foot— toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How came it thither I 
knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but after innumerable fluttering 
thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my 



95 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 

^rtificadoti, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the 
ist degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking everjr 
iush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it 
possible to describe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination repre- 
ented things to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in 
fiy fancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimseys came into my thoughts 
ly the way. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I fled 
3to it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, 

>r went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a door, I cannot remem- 
ber; no, nor could I remember the next morning, for never frightened hare 
led to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat. 

I I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my fright, 
^he greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary to the nature 
E)f such things, and especially to the usual practice of all ci eaturcs in fear; but 
t was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed 
nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was now a great way 
off. Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in with me in 
this supposition, for how should any other thing in human shape come into 
the place? Where was the vessel that brought them^ What marks were there 
of any other footsteps And how was it possible a man should come there? 
But then, to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a 
^lacc, wiiere there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print 
of his foot behind him, and that e\en for no purpose too, for he could not be 
sure I should see it,— this w as an amazement the other u ay. I considered that 
jthe devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me 

E han this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the other side 
)f the island, he w^ould never have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place 
where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in 
^he sand too, W'hich the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have 
jdefaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all 
khe notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all apprehen- 
sions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then, that it must be 
isome more dangerous creature, viz.: that it must be some of the savages of the 
niain land opposite, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and either 
driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made the island, and had 
been on shore, but were gone away again to sea; being as loath, perhaps, to 
have staid in this desolate island as I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I w^as very thankful in my 
thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they 
did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded that some 
JJjhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. 
Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having found out 
Jl'y boat, and that there were people here; and that, if so, I should certainly 
have them come again in greater numbers, and devour me; that if it should 



96 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


happen that they should not find me, yet they would find my enclosure, 
destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should 
perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence in 
God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had of His 

f oodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, b\ 
lis power, the provisions which He had made for me by His goodness. { 
reproached im sclf with my laziness, that would not sow any more corn one 
year than would just serve me till the next season, as if no accident could 
intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground; and 
this I thought so just a reproof, that 1 resolved for the future to have two or 
three years’ corn beforehand; so that, whatever might come, I niight not perish 
for want of bread. \ 

How strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of manJ and by what 
secret different springs arc the affections hurried about, as different circuin* 
stances present! I'o-day we love what to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek 
W'hat to-morrow we shun; to-day w'e desire what to-morrow we fear, na\, 
even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me, at this time, 
in the mOvSt lively manner imaginable, for I, w^hose only affliction was that I 
seemed banished from human society, that 1 w^as alone, circumscribed by the 
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I called silent 
life; that I was one whom Heaven thought not w'orthy to be numbered among 
the living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures; that to have seen ont 
of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life, 
and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of 
salvation, could bestowx I say, that I should now tremble at the very appre- 
hensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the 
shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great mam 
curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first surprise 
I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely wise and good 
providence of God had determined for me; that as 1 could not foresee whai 
the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his 
sovereignty; who, as 1 was his creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, 
to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as 1 
a creature that had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn me 
to what punishment he thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to bear i 
his indignation, because I had sinned against him. 1 then reflected, that as God, 
who was not only righteous, but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish 
and afilict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if He did not think fit to do 
so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to 
His will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to 
Him, and quietly to attend the dictates and directions of His daily providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may saj^ weeks and 
months; and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot 
omit. One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 97 

inger from the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me very much; 
)on which these words of the Scripture came into my thoughts: “Call upon 
c in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.’^ 
non this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not only comforted, 
lit I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: 
rhen I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first 
ords that presented to me were, “Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, 
id he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.” It is impossible to 
tpress the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, 
id was no more sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it came 
ito my thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, 
id that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore 
•om my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade 
lyself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot; and 
hy might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I was going that 
ay to the boat? Again I considered also, that I could by no means tell, for 
;rtain, where I had trod, and where 1 had not; and that if, at last, this was 
ily the print of my own foot, 1 had played the part of those fools who 
y to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at 
lem more than anybody. 

Now 1 began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not 
irred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to starve 
)r provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but some barley-cakes 
id water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually 
as my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain and 
iconvenience for w^ant of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, 
id almost dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, therefore, with the 
clief that this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and that 
might be truly said to start at rny own shadow, I began to go abroad again, 
id went to my country-house to milk my flock: but to see with what fear 
went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now 
id then, to lay down my basket, and run for my life, it would have made 
ly one have thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had 
ecn lately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, I went 
own thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little 
older, and to think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination; 
ut I could not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the 
lore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if 
iere was any similitude or fitness, that 1 might be assured it was my own foot: 
ot when 1 came to the place— first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I 
lid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts: 
-condly, when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, I found 
foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things filled my head with 
imaginations, and gave me the vapors again to the highest degree, so 
1 shook with cold like one in an ague; and I went home again, filled 



9$ WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there; or, in short, 
that the island was inhabited, and T might be surprised before I was aware; 
and what course to take for my security I knew not. 

O what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! It deprives 
theni of the use of those means which reason offers for their relief. The first 
thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my 
tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the enemy should find them, and then 
frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like booty: then the 
simple thing of digging up my two corn-fields, lest they should find such a 
gram there, and still be prompted to frequent the island: then to demolish 
my bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of habitation, md 
be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night’s cogitations after I was con\e 
home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were 
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors. Thus, fear of danger is te»^ 
thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the 
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the evil which 
we are anxious about: and what was worse than all this, 1 had not that relief 
in this trouble that, from the resignation I used to practice, I hoped to have. 
I looked, 1 thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines 
were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due 
ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon 
His providence, as I had done before, for my deliverance; which if 1 had done, 
I had at least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and 
perhaps carried through it with more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the morning 
I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, 
tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much better 
composed than I had ever been before. And now 1 began to think sedately; 
and upon debate with myself, 1 concluded that this island (w'hich was so 
exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I 
had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that although 
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, j et that there might 
sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, cither wuth design, or perhaps 
never but when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this place; 
that I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow 
or figure of any people yet; and that, if at any time they should be driven 
here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing 
they had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most I 
could suggest any danger from was, from any casual accidental landing of 
s^^ggllng people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven 
hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went 
off again with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest they 
should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and that, 
therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case 
I should see any savages land upon the spot. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 99 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to brbg 
a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where my 
fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this, therefore, I 
resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semi- 
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double row of 
trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention: these trees having 
been planted so thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven between 
them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon 
finished. So that 1 had now a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened 
with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything 1 could think of, to make it 
strong; having in it seven little holes, about as big as 1 might put my arm out 
at. In the inside of this, 1 thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with 
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the 
wall and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant 
the muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the 
sliip; these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held 
them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes’ 
time; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought 
myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done 1 stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great 
length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which 
I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I 
might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be- 
tween them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they 
might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to approach 
my outer wall. 

1 hus, in two years’ time, I had a thick grove; and in five or six years’ time 1 
had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and strong that 
It was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what kind soever, could ever 
imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the 
way which I proposed to my^self to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was 
by setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke 
in, and left room to place another ladder upon that; so that when the two 
ladders were taken down, no man living could come down to me without doing 
himself mischief; and if they had come down, they w^ere still on the outside of 
niy outer wall. 

Thus 1 took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own 
preservation; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not altogether vidthout 
just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear 
suggested to me. 

While this was doing, 1 was not altogether careless of my other affairs; for I 
had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were not only a 
ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, with- 
out the expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting 
after the wild ones; and 1 was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have 
ffiem all to nurse up over again.

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


For this purpose, after lon^ consideration, I could think of but two ways to 
preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave under 
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was to enclose 
two or three little b'ts of land, remote from one another, and as much con- 
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in each 
place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be able 
to raise them again with little trouble and time; and this, though it would 
require a good deal of time and labor, I thought was the most rational design 
Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the 
island; and 1 pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart could 
wish for: it was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the holloty and 
thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavorinu 
to come back that way from the eastern part of the island. Here 1 found a (ilear 
piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an 
enclosure by nature; at least, it did not W'ant near so much labor to make it so 
as the other piece of ground 1 had worked so hard at. ’ 

1 immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and, in less than a 
month’s amc, I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it which vou 
please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be 
were well enough secured in it; so, without any further delay, 1 removed ten 
young shc-goats, and two he-goars, to this piece; and when they were there 
I continued to perfect the fence, till 1 had made it as secure as the other; which 
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal’ 
All this labor I w'as at the expense of purely from my apprehensiifns on the 
account of the print of a man’s foot; for, as jet, 1 had ncicr seen any hunm 
creature come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasi- 
ness, which indeed, made my life much less conifortalilc than it was before as 
may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare 
of the fear of man. And this 1 must observe with trrief too thnr tht^ 
posure of my mind had great impression also upon tlie religious part of my 
tlioughts; for the dread and terror of falling into tiic hands of ^ 

cannibals lay so upon my spirits that 1 sel l .n f,. n u- ^

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

another deposit; whcn^ wandering more to the west point of the island than I 
had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought 1 saw a boat upon the sea, 
at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one of the sea- 
iTien s chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this 
was so remote that 1 could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it 
till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or 
not, I do not know, but as I descended from the hill 1 could see no more of it, 
so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass 
in my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, 
indeed, I had never been before, 1 w^as presently convinced that the seeing the 
print of a man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined; 
and but that it was a special providence that 1 was cast upon the side of the 
island where the savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing 
was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to 
be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbor; 
likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken 
any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their 
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which 
hereafter. 

AMicri I was conic down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the S. W* 
point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible 
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, 
hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particularly, I observed a 
place w here there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a 
cockpit, \v here I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman 
f castings upon the bodies of their fcllow-crcatures. 

1 was so astonished 'w ith the sight of these things, that I entertained no notions 
of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my apprehensions were 
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the 
horror of the degeneracy of human nature, w hich though 1 had heard of it often, 
)et I never had so near a view of before; in short, 1 turned away my face from 
the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I w as just at the point of 
fainting, w hen Nature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having 
vomited w ith uncommon violence, 1 was a little relieved, but could not bear to 
stay in the place a moment: so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, 
and walked on tow^ards my owm habitation. 

When 1 came a little out of that part of tliat island, I stood still aw^hilc, as 
ama/cd, and then, recovering myself, 1 looked up w ith the utmost affection of 
my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast 
my first lot in a part of the w orld where I W'as distinguished from such dreadful 
creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed my present condition very 
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to give 
thanks for than to complain of; and this, above all, that 1 had, even in this 
miserable condition, been comforted w’irh the knowledge of Himself, and the 
of His blessing: w hicli w as a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to 
all the misery w^hich I had suffered or could suffer. 



102 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began to be 
much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before; 
for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what 
they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything 
here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it, with- 
out finding anything to theu: purpose. 1 knew I had been here now almost 
eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature there 
before; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as 1 was now, 
if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; 
it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless 
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make my'^elf knowiji to* 
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have D^een 
speaking of, and of the \Vrctched inhuman custom of their devouring and 
eatingsonc another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close wnthin 
my own circle, for almost tw’o } cars after tliis: w hen I say my owm circle, I 
mean by it my three plantations, \ iz.: my castle, my country-scat ( w hich I called 
my bower), and my enclosure in the w^oods: nor did I look after this for any 
other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for the a\crsion which Nature 
gave me to these hellish wTCtches was such, that 1 w as as fearful of seeing them 
as of seeing the devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat 
all this time, but began rather to think of making another; for 1 could not think 
of ever making an) more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to 
me, lest 1 should meet with some of these creatures at sea; in w hich case, if ! 
had happened to have fallen into their hands, 1 knew w hat w^ould have been 
my lot. 


Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I w^as in no danger of being 
discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I 
began to live just in the same composed manner as before, only w ith this dif- 
ference, that I used more caution, and kept my e) cs more about me than I did 
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was 
more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the island, should 
happen to hear it. It was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I had 
furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I liad no need to hunt 
any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them 
after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before: so that for two 
years after this, 1 believe 1 never fired my gun once off, though I never went 
out without it; and, what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, 
I always carried them out with me, or at least tw^o of them, sticking them in 
my goatskin belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out 
of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most 
formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the fonner 
description of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword 
han^g at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard. 

^ mgs going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting these 
to my former calm, sedate way of living. All these 
things tended to show me, more and more, how far my conditiOT was from 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


103 


being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other particulars of 
life, which it might have pleased God to have made my lot. It put me upon 
reflecting how little repining there would be among mankind at any condition 
of life, if people would rather compare their condition with those that were 
^orse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those 
which are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really many things which I wanted, 
so, indeed, I thought that the frights 1 had been in about these savage wretches, 
and the concern 1 had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge 
of my invention for my own conveniences; and I had dropped a good design, 
which 1 had once bent my thoughts too much upon, and that was to try S I 
could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself 
some beer. This was really a whimsical thought, and 1 reproved myself often 
for the simplicity of it: for 1 presently saw' there would be the want of several 
things necessary to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to 
supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as 1 have observed 
already, 1 could never compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but 
wrecks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I 
had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle 
to make it boil, and yet with all these things wanting, 1 verily believe, had not 
the frights and terrors I w as in about the savages intervened, I iiad undertaken 
it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for 1 seldom gave anything over without 
accomplishing it, wlicn once 1 had it in my head to begin it. But my invention 
now rail quite an(»ther w'ay; for night and day, 1 could think of nothing but 
how 1 might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel, bloody entertain- 
ment, and, if possible, save the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It 
would take up a larger volume than this w'holc work is intended to be, to set 
down all the contri\ ances 1 hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, 
for the destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent 
their coming hither any more; but all this was ab(»rtive: nothing could be 
possible to take effect, unless 1 was to be there to do it myself: and what could 
one man do among them, when perhaps there might be wenty or thirty of 
them together with their darts, or their bows and arrows, w'ith which they 
could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun? 

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place w'here they made their 
fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled 
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow^ up all that W'as near it: but 
as, in the first place, 1 should be unwilling to waste so much pow der upon them, 
my store being now^ within the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be 
sure of its going off at any certain lime, w hen it might surprise them; and, at 
best, that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their cars and 
fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; 
and then proposed that I w^ould place myself in ambush in some convenient 
place, with my three guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their bloody 
ceremony let fly at them, when 1 should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two 
or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and 



J04 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

mv sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them 
all This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it, that 
I often dreanied of it, and sometimes, that 1 was just going to let fly at them in 
mv sleep I ent so far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself several 
days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to W'atch 
for them, and 1 went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more 
familiar to me; but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and 
a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the 
horror 1 had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring 
one another, abetted my malice. Well, at length I found a place in the side of 
the hill, where 1 vas satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats 
coming; and might then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, 
convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which there Svas 
a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe 
all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, w hen they were 
so close together as that it w'ould be next to impossible that I should miss ray 
shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In 
this place, then, 1 resolved to fulfil my design; and accordingly, 1 prepared two 
muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded wfirh a 
brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol 
bullets; and the fowling-piece 1 loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of 
the largest size; I also loaded my pistols w’ith about four bullets each; and, in 
this posture, well provided wfith ammunition for a second and third charge, I 
prepared myself for my expedition. 

After 1 had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put it 
in practice, I continually made my tour e\cry morning to the top of the hill, 
which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to sec 
if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing 
over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard dut}% after 1 had for two or 
three months constantly kept my w’atch, but came ahvays back without any 
discovery; there having not, in all that time, been the least appearance, not only 
on or near the shore, but on the w hole ocean, so far as my eyes or glass could 
reach every way. 

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I kept up 
the vigor of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the w'hile in a suitable 
form for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked 
savages, for an offence which I had not at all entered into any discussion of 
in my thoughts, any farther than my passions w ere at first fired by the horror 
I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that coiyitr)'; who, it seems, 
had been suffered by Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have 
no other guide than that of their owm abominable and vitiated passions; and, 
cons^uently, were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such 
horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but Nature, entirely 
abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have 
run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the 
fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE lOS 

so my opinion of the action itself began to alter; and 1 began, with cooler and 
calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in; what authority or 
call 1 had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, 
whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go 
on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of His judgments one upon another; 
how far these people were offenders against me, and what right I had to engage 
in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously upon one another. 

1 debated this very often with myself thus: “How do 1 know what God Himself 
judges in this particular case? It is certain these people do not conimit this as 
a crime; it is not against their own consciences reproving, or their light re- 
proaching them; they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in 
defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They 
think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in w ar, than we do to kill an ox; 
or to eat human flesh, than w'c do to eat mutton.” 

When 1 considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was certainly 
in the wrong; that these people wxre not murderers, in the sense that 1 had 
before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were 
murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more fre- 
quently, upon many occasions, put w'hole troops of men to the sword, without 
giving quarter, though they threw down their arms, and submitted. In the next 
place, it occurred to me, that although the usage they gave one another was 
thus brutish and inhuman, yet it w^as really nothing to me— these people had 
done me no injury; that if they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my imme- 
diate preservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for it; but that 
I w’^as yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and 
consequently no design upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me 
to fall upon them; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all 
their barbarities practiced in America, w^hcre they destroyed millions of these 
people; who, how^ever they were idolaters and barbarians, and had several 
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to 
their idols, wxrc yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the 
rooting them out of the country is spoken of w ith the utmost abhorrence and 
detestation by even the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all other 
Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece 
of cruelty, unjustifiable cither to Ciod or man; and for which the very name of 
a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity or 
of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent 
for the produce of a race of men, w ho were without principles of tenderness, 
or the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark 
of generous temper in the mind. 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full stop; 
and 1 began, by little and little, to be off my design, and to conclude I had 
taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the savages; and that it was 
not my business to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me; and this it 
was my business, if possible, to prevent: but that, if I were discovered and 
attacked by them, 1 knew my duty. On the other hand, 1 argued with myself, 



106 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

that this really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and 
destroy myself; for, unless I was suie to kill every one that not only should be 
on shore at that time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but 
one of them escaped to tell their country people what had happened, they 
would come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and 
I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at present, I had 
no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought, neither 
in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair: 
that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, and 
not to leave the least sign for them to guess by that there were any living 
creatures upon the island— I mean of human shape. Religion joined in with this 
prudential resolution; and I was convinced now, many ways, that I was pcrfi^ctly 
out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction 
of innocent creatures— 1 mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were 
guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were na- 
tional, and I ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of 
nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution 
for national offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in 
a public manner, by such ways as best please Him. I'his appeared so clear to me 
now, that nothing w^as a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been 
suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe w^ould have 
been no less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave 
most humble thanks, on my knees, to God, that He had thus delivered me from 
blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me the protection of His providence, 
that I might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or, that I might not lay 
my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in 
defence of my own life. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far was I from 
desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in all that time I never 
once went up the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to 
know whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might not 
be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them or be provoked, by 
any advantage that might present itself, to fall upon them: only this I did; I 
went and removed my boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and 
carried it down to the cast end of the whole island, w here I ran it into a little 
cove, which 1 found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of 
the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats 
upon any account whatever. With my boat I carried away everything that I 
had left there belonging to her, though not necessary for tha bare going thither, 
viz,: a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but 
which indeed could not be called either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the 
best I could make of its kind: all these I removed, that there might not be the 
least shadow for discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human habita- 
tion '^pon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, 
and ^Idom went from my cell except upon my constant employment, to milk 
my shc-goats, and manage my little nock in the wood, which, as it was quite On 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 107 

the other part of the island, was out of danger; for certain it is that these 
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts 
of finding anything here, and consequently never wandered off from the coast, 
and I doubt not but they might have been several times on shore after my 
apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed I looked 
back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have 
been, if I had chopped upon them and had been discovered before that; when, 
naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small 
shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island to see what I 
could get; what a surprise should 1 have been in, if, when I discovered the print 
of a man’s foot, 1 had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found 
them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my 
escaping them! The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, 
and distressed my mind so much that I could not soon recover it, to think what 
1 should have done, and how 1 should not only have been unable to resist them, 
but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might 
have done; much less what now, after so much consideration and preparation, 
1 might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be 
very melancholy, and, sometimes, it would last a great while; but I resolved it 
all, at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me from 
so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which I could 
have no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had not the 
least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being 
possible. This renewed a contemplation which had often come into my thoughts 
in former times, w^hen first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, 
in the dangers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered 
when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), 
a doubt or hesitation whether to go this w^ay or that way, a secret hint shall 
direct us this way, when we intended to go that way; nay, when sense, our 
own inclination, and perhaps business, has called us to go the other way, yet a 
strange impression upon the mind, from we know not w'hat springs, and by we 
know not what power, shall overrule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards 
appear, that had we gone that way which we should have gone, and even to our 
imagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost. UpoQ 
these, and many like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, 
that whenever 1 found those secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not 
doing anything that presented, or going this way or that way, I never failed to 
obey the secret dictate; though 1 knew no other reason for it than that such a 
pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my mind. I could give many examples of 
the success of this conduct in the course of my life, but more especially in the 
latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which 
it is very likely 1 might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes 
then that I see with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot out 
advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary 
incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret 
intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence they 



108 WORKS OF DAKIEL DEFOE 

will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certait^ 
they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and a secret communication between 
Aose embodied and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never be with^ 
stood; of which I shall have occasion to give some very remarkable instances in 
the remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if I confess that these 
anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was now upon 
me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for 
my future accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety^ more 
now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, oj| chop 
a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard; mudi less 
would I fire a gun for the same reason: and, above all, I was intolerably uj(ieasy 
at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, 
should betray me. For this reason, I removed that part of my busipess which 
required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in 
the woods; where, after 1 had been some time, 1 found to my unspeakable conso- 
lation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, 
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, w ould be so hardy as to 
venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted 
nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where (by mere 
accident I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such things 
now to Providence) I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make 
charcoal; -md before I go on I must observe the reason of my making this 
charcoal, which was thus. I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, 
as I said before, and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking 
my meat, &c.; so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in 
England, under turf, ull it became chark or dry coal; and then putting the fire 
out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services for 
which fire was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by the bye. While 
I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick 
branch of low brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place: 
1 was curious to look in it; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I 
found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, 
and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you that I made more haste 
out than I did in, when looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly 
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I 
knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the cave’s mouth 
shining directly in, and making the reflection. However,^ after some pause, I 
recovered myself, and began to call myself a thousand fools, and to thmk that 
he t^t was afraid to see the devil, was not fit to live twenty years in an island 
all alone; ^d that I might well thmk there was nothing in this cave that was 
mow fr^htful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up * 
nrebrand, and m I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand; I had not 
pne three steps in, before I was almost as much frightened as before; for I 
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by 



ROBINSON CRUSOE m 

& broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. 1 stepped 
back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold 
sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair 
might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, 
and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power and presence 
of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, 
and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw 
lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, 
as we say, and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him 
a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able 
to raise himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie there, —for if he 
had frightened me, so he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any one 
of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when 
1 found the cave was but very small; that is to say, it might be about twelve 
feet over, but m no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having 
ever been employed in making it but those of mere nature. 1 observed also that 
there was a place at the farther side that went in further, but it was so low that it 
required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it 
went I knew not, so, havmg no candle, 1 gave it over for that time, but resolved 
to come again the next day provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I 
had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire m the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day, 1 came provided with six large candles of my 
own makmg (for I made very good candles now of goats’ tallow, but was hard 
set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried 
rind of a weed-like netdes); and going into this low place I was obliged to 
creep upon all-fours, as I have said, almost ten yards,— which, by the way, 1 
thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it 
might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the strait, I found 
the roof rose higher up, I believe nearly twenty feet; but never was such a 
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was to look round the sides 
and roof of this vault or cave— the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to 
me from my two candles. What it was in the rock— whether diamonds or any 
other precious stones, or gold— which I rather supposed it to be— I knew not. 
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly 
dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, 
so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was riiere 
any damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only difficulty in it was the entrance, 
-which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as 1 wanted, 
I thought was a convenience, so that 1 was really rejoiced at the discovery, and 
resolved, without any delay, to hrixig some of those things which I was most 
anxious about to this place; particularTy, I resolved to bring hither my magazine 
of powder, and all my spare arms,— viz.: two fowling-pieces— for I had three in 
all-and three muskets— for of them I had eight in all; so I kept in my casde only 
five, which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, 
and were ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of 



WORKS OP DANIEL DEFOE 

my anununitton^ I happened to open the barrel of powder whith I 
todc up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water 
liad penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which, 
and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell, 
60 that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the center of the ca^. 
This was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away 
thkher, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my 
cistle, for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried hither all the lead I had 
left for bullets. . 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live in 
caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; for I persiuded 
myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, fhey 
could never find me out— or if they did, they would not venture to attach me 
here. The old goat whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the 
next day after 1 made this discovery; and 1 found it much easier to dig a great 
hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him oht; 
so I interred him there, to prevent offence to my nose. 

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and was 
$0 naturalized to the place and the manner of livmg, that, could 1 but have 
enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to disturb me, I 
could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time 
there, even to the last moment, till 1 had laid me down and died, like the old 
goat in the cave. 1 had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, 
which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did 
before;— first, I had taught my Poll, as I named before, to speak; and he did it 
so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to 
me, for I believe no bird ever spoke plainer,— and he lived with me no less than 
six-and-twenty years; how long he might have lived afterwards I know not, 
though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. 
My dog was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than Sixteen 
years of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they multi- 
plied, as I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of 
them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all 1 had; but at length, when 
the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually 
driving them from me, and letting them have no provisions with me, they all 
tan wild into the woods, except two or three favorites, which I kept tame, and 
whose young, when they had any, 1 always drowned; and these were part of 
my faniily. Besides these, I always kept two or three household kids about me, 
whom 1 taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two mbre parrots, which 
talked pretty well, and would all call “Robin Crusoe,” but none like my first; 
nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that 1 had done with him. 
I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew not, that I caught upon 
the shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had planted before 
casde-wall being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all 
Jmfnd among these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me, 
HO that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented with the life I led, 



ROBmSON CRUSOE tii 

if I cottld have been sectured from the dread of the savages* But it iva$ otherwise 
directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story 
to make this just observation from it— how frequently, in the course of out 
lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are 
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of 
our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we 
are fallen into, I could give many examples of this in the course of my unac* 
countable life, —but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the 
circumstances of my last years of solitary residence m this island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third year; 
and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call it), was the pai^ 
ticular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty much abroad m the 
fields, when, going out early in the morning, even before it was through day- 
hght, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a 
distance from me of about two miles, towards that part of the island where I 
had observed some savages had been, as before, and not on the other side,— but, 
to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my 
grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet 1 had no more 
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling 
over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and 
improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were people in 
the place, and would then never rest till they had found me out. In this ex- 
tremity I went back directly to my casde, pulled up the ladder after me, and 
made all things without look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence; 1 
loaded all my cannon, as 1 called them,— that is to say, my muskets which were 
mounted upon my new fortification,— and all my pistols, and resolved to defend 
myself to the last gasp, not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the 
Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the hands 
of the barbarians. I continued in this posture about two hours, and began to 
be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitdw^ 
a while longer, and musing what 1 should do in this case, I was not able to bear 
sitting in ignorance any longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, 
where there was a flat place, as 1 observed before, and then pulling the ladder 
after me, I set it up again, and mounted the top of the hill, and puumg out my 
perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose, 1 laid me down flat on my 
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found there 
were no less than nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they had made, 
not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely 
hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flerfi 
which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I could not tcU. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore; 
as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait for the return of the 
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put 
me into, especkuly seeinsr them come on my side of the island, and so near to 



^2 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

me- but when I considered their coming must be always with the current of the 
ebb 1 began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied tiiat 1 
might go abroad with safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not 
on shore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad about my 

harvest work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved; for, as soon as the tide made to the westward, 
I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle, as we call it) away. I should have 
observed, that for an hour or more before they went off they were dancmg, 
and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glass. I could not 
perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were stark naked, ai|d had 
not the least covering upon them; but whether they were men or wospen I 
could not distinguish. ' 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, 
and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side without a scab- 
bard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away to the hill where I 
had discovered the first appearance of all; and as soon as 1 got thither, which 
was not in less than two hours (for I could not go quickly, being so loaded with 
arms as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes more of the savages at 
that place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making 
over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down 
to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had 
been about had left behind it, viz.: the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of 
human bodies eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and 
sport. I w^s so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to premedi- 
tate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom or how 
many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits w^hich they made thus to 
this island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any 
more of them came on shore there again,—that is to say I neither saw them 
nor any footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to the rainy seasons, 
then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all this while I 
lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming 
upon me by surprise; from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is 
more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off that 
expectation, or those apprehensions. 

During all this time 1 was in the murdering humor, and spent most of my 
hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to circum- 
vent and fall upon them the very next time I should see them,— especially if they 
should be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties; nor did I con- 
»der at all that if 1 killed one party— suppose ten or a dozen— I was still the next 
month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infinituntj till I 
should be, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters, and 
permps much more so. I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of 
xmnd, expecting that 1 should one day or other fall into the hands of these 
merciless creatures: and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not without 

greatest care and caution imaginable. And now I 
ZomuJ, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided 8 tame 



ROBINSON C31USOE lit 


flock or herd of j^ats; for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially 
near that side of the island where diey usually came, lest I should alarm the 
savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again 
with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, aiid then 
I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and three months more 
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then 1 found them again, as I 
shall soon observe. It is true they m^ht have been there once or twice; but 
either they made no stay, or at least f did not see them; but, in the month of 
May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a 
very strange encounter with them; of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months’ interval, 
was very great; 1 slept unquictly, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
started out of my sleep in the night. In the day, great troubles overwhelmed my 
mind; and in the night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the reasons 
why I might justify doing it. But to waive all this for a while.— It was in the 
middle or May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden 
calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon my post still; I say, it was on the 
sixteenth of May, that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great 
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I knew not 
what was the particular occasion of it; but as I v/as reading in the Bible, and 
taken up with very serious thoughts about my present condition, I was sur- 
prised with the noise of a gun, as 1 thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, 
a surprise quite of a different nature from any I had met with before; for the 
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind. 1 started up ia 
the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle 
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the second dme, got 
to the top of the hill at the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a 
second ^n, which, accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and by the 
sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven down 
the current in my boat. I immediately considered that this must be some ship 
in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and 
fired these signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, 
at that minute, to think, that though I could not help them, it might be they 
might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at han^ 
and, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood 
was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned 
fairly out, so that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must 
need see It, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I 
heard another gun, and after that several others, all from me same quarter. I 
plied my fire all night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the 
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of the island, 
whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish-no, not with my glass; Ae 
distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy also; at least, it was 
so out at sea. 


Hooked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not move} 
I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and beh^ eager, you may

be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the sotidi 
side <rf the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been carried away by the 
current; and getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly clear, 
I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the 
night u^n those concealed rocks which 1 found when I was out in my boat; 
aim which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind 
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the most 
desperate, hopeless condition that ever 1 had been in in all my life. Thus, what 
is one man’s safety is another man’s destruction; for it seems these men, wl^oever 
they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly (under 
wamr, had been driven upon them m the night, the wind blowing h^d at 
E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as 1 must necessarily suppose they di| not, 
they must, as 1 thought, have endeavored to have saved themselves on shotc by 
the nelp of their boat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when they 
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, 1 imagined that 
upon seeing my light, they might have put themselves into their boat, and 
endeavored to make the shore; but that the sea runnmg very high, they might 
have been cast away. Other times, I imagined that they might have lost their 
lK 3 at before, as might be the case many ways; particularly, by the breaking of 
the sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to stave, or take in 
pieces, their boat, and someames to throw it overboard with their own hands. 
Other times, I imagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, 
upon the signals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried them off. 
Other times, 1 fancied they were all gone off to sea in them boat, and being 
hurried away by the current that 1 had been formerly in, were carried out into 
the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing; and that, 
perhaps, they might by this time think or starving, and of being in a condition 
to eat one another. 


As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in, I 
could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity 
them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it gave me more and 
more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro- 
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships’ companies, who 
were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared 
but mine. I learned here again to observe, that it is very rare that the providence 
of God casts us into any condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but 
we may see something or other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse 
circumstances than our own. Such certainly was the case of these men, of 
whom 1 could not so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved; 
nothmg could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not 
perish there, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another 
ship m company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the 
least sign or appearance of any such thing. 1 cannot explain, by any possible 
of words, what a strange longing I felt in my soul upon tJiM s®ht, 
some^es thus:— “O that there had been but one or two, my, <w 
one soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me that I i^ht but 



<mmm uf 

hav« had companipn, one fellow-creature, to h spoken tjo me and ^ 
have conversed with!** In all the time of my solitary 1 . 1 never fdt so earnest; 

so strong a desire ' : the society of my fellow-crcaturcs, 
at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the affections, which, when they 
are set a-going by some object m view, or though not in view, yet rendered 
pxesent to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the 
soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent eager embracings of the object that the 
absence of it is insupportable. Such were these earnest wishings that but one 
man had been saved. 1 believe I repeated the words, “O that it had been but oner* 
a thousand times; and my desires were so moved by it, that when 1 spoke the 
words my hands would dinch together, and my fingers would press the palm$ 
of my hands, so that if 1 had had any soft thing in my hand, I would have 
crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would strike together, and 
set against one another so strong, that for some time 1 could not part thexn 
again. Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner of 
them. All I can do is, to describe the fact, which was even surprising to me, 
when I found it, though 1 knew not from whence it proceeded; it was, doubt- 
less, the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, 
realizing the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-Chrisrians 
would have been to me. But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both^ 
forbade it, for till the last year of my being on this island, I never knew 
whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the afHictkm« 
some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the eoA 
of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seamati^a 
waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but 
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of. He had 
nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a tobacco-pipe— the last was 
to me of ten times more value than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to tJhis 
wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might be usefid 
to me. But that did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that there 
might be yet some living creature on board, whose life 1 might not only savOi 
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree; and this 
thought clung so to my heart that 1 could not be quiet night or day, but 1 must 
venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to 
providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it couU 
not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I 
should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, prepared 
everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot bf fz^ water, 
a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), 
a basket of raisins; and thus, loading myself with everything necessary, I 
went down to my boat, got the water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all 
cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My secrnid cargo was a 
great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another 



jjg WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

laffire pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of small loaves, or barley cafc^ 
more ^an before, with a bottle of goat’s milk, and a cheese: aU of which with 
great labor and sweat I carried to my boat; and praymg to God to direct my 
voyage, I put out, and rowing, or paddling the canoe along the shore, came 
at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side. And now I was 
to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked 
on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a 
distance, and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the 
hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresay that 
if I was driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a greaj: way 
out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again; an|i that 
then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should 
be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my enter- 
prise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, 
and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between 
fear and desire, about my voyage, when as I was musing, I could perceive 
that the tide was turned, and the flood came on; upon which, my going was 
impracticable for so many hours. Upon this, presently it occurred to me, that I 
should go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I could, 
how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the flood came in, that I might 
judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven 
another way home, with the same rapidity of the currents. This thoi^ht was 
no sooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill, which sufficiently 
overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the 
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my 
return. Here I found that as the current of ebb set out close by the south 
point of the island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the 
north side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep the north side of the 
island in my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to set out 
with the first of the tide; and, reposing myself for the night in my canoe, under 
the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a little out to 
sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set east- 
ward, and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did not so hurry me as 
the current on the south side had done before, so as to take from me all govern- 
ment of the boat; but having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, at a 
great rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. 
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by its building, was Spanish, 
ii' between two rocks: all the stem and quarter of her 
ww beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, 
had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by 
the board, that is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the 
head and bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon 
her, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and, as soon as I caUed him, 
jutnped into the sea to come to me: I took him into the boat, but found him 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 117 

almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bitad, and he 
devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the 
snow: I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would 
have let him, he would burst himself. After this I went on board; hut the first 
sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the 
ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probabK 
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so 
continually over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled 
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under 
water. Besides the dog, there was nothmg left in the ship that had life; nor 
any goods, that 1 could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were 
some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in 
the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, 1 could see; but they were too 
big to meddle with. 1 saw several chests, which 1 believe belonged to some of 
the seamen; and I got tv/o of them into the boat, without examining what was 
in them. Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore part broken off, I 
am persuaded I might have made a good voyage, for, by what I found in these 
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; 
and, if I may guess from the course she steered, she must have been bound 
from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond 
the Brazils to the Havana, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She 
had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at tnat time, to anybody; 
but what became of the crew I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a litdc cask full of liquor, of about twenty 
gallons, which I got into my boat, with much difficulty. There were several 
muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of 
powder in it: as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them; so I left them^ 
but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted 
extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and 
a gridiron, and \\ ith this cargo, and the dog, 1 came away, the tide beginning 
to make home again: and the same evening, about an hour within night, 1 
reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that 
night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to harbor what 1 had got in 
my new cave, and not carry it home to niy castle. After refreshing myself, I 
got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of 
liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils; and, 
in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the chests, I found several 
things of great use to me; for example, 1 found in one a fine case of bottles, of 
an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and very good; Ae 
bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped wiA silver. I found two 
pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on Ae top that Ae 
salt water had not hurt them; and two more of Ae same, which the water had 
spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and 
about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and colored neck-cloAs; 
Ae former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my 
face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to Ae till in Ae chest, I found 





m 

WORKS OF DAMEL DEFOE 

tluere three great bags of pieces-of-e^ht* which held about eleven hundred 
pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in paper, six doubloons of gold, 
and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a 
pound. In the other chest were some dothes, but of little value; but, by the 
circumstances, it must have belonged to the gimner’s mate; though there was 
no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three small 
flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon 
the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for, as 
to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt 
under my feet, and I would have given it all for three or four pairs of English 
shoes and stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had none on my 
feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pairs of shoes now, which l\took 
off the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I fifund 
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they 
were not like our English shoes either for ease or service, being rather what we 
call pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman’s chest about fifty pieces-of-eight, 
in rials, but no gold: I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, 
which seemed to belong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money 
home to my cave, and laid it up, as 1 had done that before which 1 had brought 
from our own ship; but it was a great pity, as 1 said, that the other part of 
this ship had not come to my share; for 1 am satisfied 1 might have loaded my 
canoe several times over with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, 
it might lie here safe enough till I come agam and fetch it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went back 
to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbor, where 
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found 
everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my old 
fashion, and take care of my family affairs, and for a while 1 lived easy enough, 
only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not 
go abroad so much; and if, at any time, I did stir with any freedom, it was 
always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the 
savages never came, and where I could go without so many precautions, and 
such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went the 
other way. I lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky 
head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, 
was all these two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were possi- 
bie^ I might get away from this island; for sometimes I was for making another 
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing left 
t^ere worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way, some- 
times another: and I believe verily ijf I had had the boat that I went from 
Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither. 
Ihave been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are touched 
l||e general plague of mankind, whence, for aught 1 know, one half of their 
flow; I mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God 
|^l|l|4eture hath placed them: for, not to look back upon my primitive condi-^ 
and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which was, as I

may ^ ori^ml my my «^ubsequeat mistakes of the same kmd had been 
the mcails of my coming into this miserable condition; for had that Providencei 
which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with con** 
fined desires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, 1 
might have been by this time (I mean in the time of my being in this island) 
one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils: nay, I am persuaded, that 
by the improvements I had made in that little time I lived there, and the 
increase I should probably have made if I had remained, 1 might have been 
worth a hundred thousand moidores; and what business had I to leave a seil^ed 
fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn shper^ 
cargo to Guinea to fetch Negroes, when patience and time would have so 
increased our stock at home, that we could have bought them at our own door 
from those whose business it was to fetch them^ and though it had cost tis 
something more, yet the difference of that price was by no means worth 
saving at so great a hazard. But as this is usually the fate of young heads, SO 
reflection upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise or more years, or 
of the dear-bought experience of time: so it was with me now; and yet so deep 
had die mistake taken root m my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my 
station, but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of my 
escape from this place: and that I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader, 
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper to give some 
account of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my 
escape, and how, and upon what foundation I acted. 

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to 
the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my condi^ 
tion restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than I had 
before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it than the 
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four-and-twentieth 
year of my first setting foot m this island of solitude, 1 was lying in my bed oi: 
hammock, awake, very well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness 
of body, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by no 
means dose my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, other- 
wise than as follows:—It is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of 
thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain— the 
memory, in this night’s time: 1 ran over the whole history of my life in minia- 
ture, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also 
of that part of my life since I came to this island. In my reflections upon the 
state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was comparing the 
happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation here, wim th^ 
life of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in ever since I had seen the 
print of a foot in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented 
the island even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of diem at 
times on shore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any 
apprehensions about i , my satisfaction was perfect, though my danget was 
the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had never 



ttj WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

jpeally been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with many very ^toGxibk 
reflexions, and particularly this one: How infimtely good that Providence is, 
which has provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his 
sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of so many 
t£)usand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract ms 
mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of 
things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround 
him. 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came ro| reflect 
seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in tnis very 
island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible 
tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a greit tree, 
or the casual approach of night, had been between me and the worst w^nd of 
destruction, viz.: that of fallmg into the hands of cannibals and savages^ who 
would have seized on me with the same view as I would on a goat or a turtle; 
and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a 
pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I was not 
sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection I 
acknowledged, with great humility, all these unknown deliverances were due, 
and without which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in 
considering tlie nature of these wretched creatures (I mean the savages), and 
how it came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of all things should 

S Ve up any of His creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so much 
flow even brutality itself, as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in some 
(at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred to me to inquire, what part of 
the world these wretches lived in? how far off the coast was from whence 
they came? what they ventured over so far from home for? what kind of 
boats they had^ and why I might not order myself and my business so, tliat I 
might be as able to go over thither, as they were to come to me. 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with myself 
when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the hands of these 
savages; or how I should escape them if they attacked me; no, nor so much as 
, how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attacked by some or 
other of them, without any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should 
not fall into their hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I should 
bend my course: none of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; 
but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat 
^ to the main land. I looked upon my present condition as the most miserable 
that could possibly be; that 1 was not able to throw myself into anything but 
death, that could be called worse; and if I reached the shore or the main, I 
might perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African 
shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; 
and, after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take 
me in; and if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an 
txkd to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed 



ROKNSON (3RUSOE tit 

[ impatient temper, made desperate, j i it were, by the long continuance 

‘ * disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on 

boar^ of, and where I had been so near obtaining what I so earnestly longed 
for, somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from them of the 
place where I was, and of the probable means of my deliverance. I was 
agitated wholly by these thoughts: all my calm of mind, in my resignation to 
Pmvidence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be 
suspended; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts to anything 
but to the project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me with |nch 
force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such 
violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as if I 
had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervor of my mind about 
it, Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of 
it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should have 
dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to it; but I dreamed that 
as I was going out in the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the 
shore two canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and that they brought with 
tliem another savage, whom they were going to kill in order to eat him; when, 
on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for 
his life; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick 
grove before my fortification, to hide himself; and that I, seeing him alone, 
and not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, 
and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to me, seeming 
to pray me to assist him; upon which 1 showed him my ladder, made him go 
up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant: and that as soon 
as I had got this man, I said to myself, “Now I may certainly venture to the 
main land, for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, 
and whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of bein^ 
devoured; what places to venture into, and what to shun.” I waked with this 
thought; and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect 
of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon coming 
to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally extrava- 
gant the other way, and threw me into a very great dejection of spirits. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion; that my only way to go about 
to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a savage into my possession; and, 
if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to 
be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were attended 
with this difficulty, that it was impossible to effect this without attacking a 
whole caravan of them and killing them all; and this was not only a very 
desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly 
scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts 
of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. 1 need not repeat 
the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the same men- 
tioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz.: that those 
™n were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could; that it was

isdf-pi^eservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this death of a 
life, and was acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually 
assaulting me, and the like; I say, though these things argued for it, yet the 
thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to 
me, and such as I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great while. 
However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after great 
perplexities about it (for ail these arguments, one way and another, struggled 
m my head a long time), the eager prevailmg desire of deliverance at length 
mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of thefee savages 
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive now to do 
it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch upon 
no probable means for it, so 1 resolved to put myself upon the watm, to see 
them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; talang such 
measures as the opportunity should present, let what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, 1 set myself upon the scout Us often 
as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartily tired of it; for it was above 
a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of that time went out to the 
west end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost every day, to look 
for canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging, and began to 
trouble me much, though 1 cannot say that it did in this case (as it had done 
some time before) wear off the edge of my desire to the thing; but the longer 
it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first 
so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I 
was now eager to be upon them. Besides, 1 fancied myself able to manage one, 
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to 
me, to do whatever 1 should direct them, and to prevent their being able at 
anjr time to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with 
this affair; but nothing still presented itself; all my fancies and schemes came 
to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long 
musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occasion 
to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by seeing no 
less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the 
people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight. The number 
of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they 
always came four or six, or sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to 
think of it, or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single- 
handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and disconjforted. However, I put 
myself into the same position for an attack that I bad formerly provided, and 
Was just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good 
whil^ listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, 
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the 
hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my head did not 
^Rp^ur above the hiD, so that they could not perceive me by any means. Here I 
by the help of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty

. had cooked it, I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I 
w not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round 

^le I was thus looking on them I perceived, by my perspective, two 
erable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid 
and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them 
(lediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden 
ird, for that was their way; and two or three others were at work im- 
liately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was left 
iding by himself, till they should be ready for him. In that very moment, 
poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound. Nature inspired 
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible 
‘tness along the sands, directly towards me; I mean, towards that part of 
coast where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowl- 
e, when I perceived him run my way; and esj^cially when, as I thought, I 
him pursued by the whole body; and now I expected the part of my 
im was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my 
ve: but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the other 
Lges would not pursue him thither, and find him there. However, I kept 
station, and ray spirits began to recover when I found that there was not 
ve three men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged, when I 
id that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained ground on 
n; so that, if he cOuld but hold out for half an hour, I saw easily he would 
ly get away from them all. 

here was between them and my castle, the creek, which I mentioned often 
he first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and 
I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would 
:aken there; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing 
t, though the tide was then up; but, plunging in, swam through in about 
ty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran with exceeding strength and 
Fmess. When the three persons came to the creek, I found that two of 
n could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the other side, 
looked at the others, but went no farther, and soon after went softly back 
in; which, as it happened, was very well for him in the end. I observed 
: the two who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the 
sk as the fellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon my 
ughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, 
jperhaps a companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called by 
vidence to save this poor creature’s life. I immediately ran down the 
iers with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both 
he foot of the ladders,, as I observed before, and getting up again with the 
haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and having a very 
cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way between the pursuers 
I the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at 
^.P^kaps as much frightened at me as at them; but I beckoned with my 
Id to him to come back; and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced toward^

the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the f orenu^ I knodbsl j 
down with the stock of my piece. 1 was loath to fire, because I would not h 
the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, i 
being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what 
make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued 1 
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced towards mm; but s. 
came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was 
to shoot at me; so I was then obliged to shoot at him first, which I did, 5 
killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, the 
he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frighti 
with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood stock still, and neither c 
forward, nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined still toi 
than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to cqme for 
which he easily understood, and came a little way; then stoppei^ again, 
then a little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perc^ve that] 
stood trembhng, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to I 
killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, . 
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he ca 
nearer and nearer, kneelmg down every ten or twelve steps, in token < 
acknowledgment for saving his life. 1 smiled at him, and looked pleasan 
and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length, he came close to me, i 
then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon I 
ground, and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it s 
was in token of swearing to be my slave forever. I took him up and made i 
of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to do ; 
for I perceived the savage whom I had knocked down was not killed, t 


stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, a 
showed him the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some \ 
to me, and though I could not understand them, yet I thought they 
pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a man’s voice that I 
heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was no 1 
for such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down recovered ' 
self so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage 
to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, 
if I would shoot him: upon this, my savage, for so I call him now, made 
motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt byr 
side, which I did. He no sooner had it, but he ran to his enemy, and at( 
blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have d 
it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had reaso^ 
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swori 
however, it seems, as 1 learned afterwards, they make their wooden swordsi 
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even cut off heads 
them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done this, he c 
laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and,J^ 
abundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down, with ^ 
of the savage that he had killed, just before me. But that which astonished "

^as to teiow how I killed the other Indian $o far off; so pointing to 
..lade sigtts to me to let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well as I 
id. When be came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, tmmg 
first on one side, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had 
lie, which it seems was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no 
.quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite 
, He took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to go away, 
[beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that more might come after 
n. Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, 

: they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and so 1 made signs 
um again to do so. He fell to work; and in an instant he had scraped a hole 
the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged 
into it, and covered him; and did so by the other also; I believe he had 
ed them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried 
^ not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the 
id. so I did not let my dream come to pass in that part, that he came into 
1 grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and 
Iraught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, from 
running: and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down 
ileep, showing him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket 
L it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay 
1 and went to sleep. 

!e was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with strait strong 
[bs, not too large, tall and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six 
rs of age. He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, 
seemed to have something very manly in his face: and yet he had all the 
wetness and softness of a European in his countenance too, especially when 
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like wool, his forehead very 
h and large; and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The 
or of the skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, 
ilow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virgimans, and other natives of 
•'erica are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive color, that had in it something 
agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face was round ana 
up, his nose small, not flat like the Nepocs; a very good mouth, thin lips, 
his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory. 

he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he awoke 
lin, and came out of the cave to me; for 1 had been milking my goats, which 
iad in th6 enclosure just by; when he espied me, he came running to me, 
'ing himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of a 
*^ble, thankful disposition, making a great many antic gestures to show it. 
last he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets mf 
^er foot upon his head, as he had done before; and after this made all the 
“‘i to me of subjection, servitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me know 
he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood him in nianv things, 
him know I was vtty well pleased with him. In a little time 1 oegan to 
iK to him, and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I let him know his 



126 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life: I called him so 
the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master; and then let h 
know that was to be my name: I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, a 
to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and 
him see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it; and gave him a c 
of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied with, and made signs i 
it was very good for him. I kept there with hmi all that night; but, as soon 
it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would gi 
him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked i 
he went by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactl) 
the place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them agai 
making signs to me that he should dig them up again and eat th^m. At this 
appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made a*^ if I woul 
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned w ith my hand to him to come aw? 
which he did immediately, with great submission. I then led him up to t 
top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out my glass 
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no appearance: 
them or their canoes, so that it w as plam they were gone, and had left th(i 
two comrades behind them, without any search after them. 

But 1 was not content with this discovery; but having now more coura|( 
and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving hr 
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I fouii 
he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and 1 tvi 
for myself and away we marched to the place where these creatures hi 
been; for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them. Whei 
came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sm 
within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight J 
least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covere 
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces c 
flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, i 
the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a victor 
over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three o 
four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, b 
his sign's, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to fo 
upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, 
the fourth; that there had been a great battle between them and their rcJ* 
king, of whose subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken 
great number of prisoners; all which were carried to several places, by thflS 
who had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was 
here by these wretches upon those they brought hither. 

I caused hriday to gather up all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever ^ 
mained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon it, a** 
burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering stomach 
some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I showed so 
abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, tl*

Jurst not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him know that I Would 
him if he offered it. 

^hen he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to work 
ixiy man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I 
out of the poor gunner’s chest I mentioned, which I found in the wreck* 
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well; and then I made him a 
dn of goat’s skin, as well as my skill would allow (for I w^as now growm a 
srably tailor); and I gave him a cap which 1 made of hare’s skin, very 
\cnient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was clothed, for the present, 
irably well, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well 
:hcd as his master. It is true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at first; 
iring the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waist- 
t galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little easing them 
ere he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to 
m at length very well. 

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to con- 
;r where 1 should lodge him; and that I might do well for him and yet be 
fcctly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place between 
two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first. 


there was a door or entrance there into my cave, 1 made a formal framed 
>r-casc, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little 
hill the entrance; and causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it 
in the night, taking in my ladder, too; so that Friday could no way come 
ne in the inside of my innermost wall without making so much noise in 
ting over that it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had now a complete 
f over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of 
hill; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and 


n thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, 

5 reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, 
ad placed a kind of a trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the 
side, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a 
at noise; as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But I 
ded none of all this precaution; for never a man had a more faithful, loving, 
:ere servant than Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or designs, 
fectly obliged and engaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those 
a child to a father; and 1 dare say he would have sacrificed his life to save 
upon any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave me of 
% put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precau- 
is for niy safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that 
^c\cr It had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of the 
rks of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world of His creatures 
' to which their faculties and the powders of their souls are adapted, 

- that He has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, the 
fie affections; the same sentiments of kindness and obligation; the same pas- 
fiN and resentments of wrongs; the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity. 



128 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

and all the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that He has givei 
us; and that when He pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, t 
are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which i. 
were bestowed, than we are. This made me very melancholy sometiines, 
reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we make of 
these, even though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp 
instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of His word added 
our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving knoi 
edge from so many millions of souls, who, if 1 might judge by this poor sava 
would make a much better use of it than we did. From hence, I sometimes v 
Jed too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it Were, arrai 
the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that yj 
from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty frorp both; bu 
shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first. That we i 
not know by what light and law these should be condemned; but that as G 
was necessarily, and by the nature of His being, infinitely holy and just, 
it could not be, but if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from H 
self, it was on account of sinning against that light, which, as the Scripti 
say, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their conscience wo) 
acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us, ai 
secondly, Thar still, as wc all arc tl»e clay in the hand of the potter, no \es 
could say to him, ‘'Why hast thou formed me thus? ” 

But to return to my new companion:—! was greatly tielighted with 
and made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make 1 
useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and understa 
me when I spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particular 
was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but undr 
stand me, or make me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to t 
to him. Now my life began to be so easy that I began to say to myself, t 
could I but have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was never 
remove from the place where 1 lived. 

After 1 had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought 
in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and fromt 
relish of a cannibal’s stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I ta 
him out with me one morning to the woods. 1 w ent, indeed, intending to kill 
kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; but as I was going 
saw a she-goat 1) ing down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by hei 
catched hold of Friday. “Hold,” said 1; “stand still;” and made signs to k 
not to stir: immediately, I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the h 
The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savaj 
his enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine how it was done, ^ 
l^isibly surprised; trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that 1 thouf 
ite would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive 1 1 
killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded; ^ 
as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him; for he came a 
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many thiflS'

not understand; but I could easily see the meaning was, to pray me not 
kill him. 

soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and 
ing him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I 
1 killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did: and while he 
; wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded 
' gun again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree 
:hin shot, so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him 
tne again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though 1 thought 
lad been a hawk; 1 say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the 
fund under the parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him 
ler&tand that 1 would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, 1 fired, and 
le him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one 
rhtened again, notwithstanding all 1 said to him; and I found he was the 
re ama/ed, because he did not see me put anything into the gun, but 
mght that there must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in 
it thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything near or far off; and the 
Dnishmcnt this created in him was such as could not wear off for a long 
[jc, and 1 belie\e, if I would have let him, he w^ould have worshipped me 
my gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for 
krai days after, but he would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered 
?n, when he was by himself, which, as 1 afterwards learned of him, was to 
jsire It not to kill him. Well, after his astonishment w^as a little over at this, 
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird 1 had shot, w hich he did, but staid 
ue time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away a good 
.tance from the place wdiere she fell- however, he found her, took her up, 
d brought her to me; and as 1 had perceived his ignorance about the gun 
foie, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let him see 
J do It, that I might be ready for any other mark that might present; but 
thing more offered at that time: so I brought home the kid, and the same 
emiig 1 took the skin off, and cut it out as well as 1 could; and having a pot 
ft)i that purpose, 1 boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very 
od broth. After 1 had begun to eat some, 1 gave some to my man, who 
mied very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest to 
^ was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not 
od to eat; and putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, 
d would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it: 

^ the other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and pre- 
sided to spit and sputter for want of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; 
It It Would not do; he would never care for salt with his meat or in his broth; 
^ast not for a great while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast 
tn the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before 
^ fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting two poles 
U one on each side of the fire, and one across on the top, and tying the string 
tne cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This Friday admired very

much, but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell iji 
how well he liked it, that I could not but understand him and at last he to 
me, as well as he could, he would never eat man’s flesh any more, which 
was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting it I 
the manner 1 used to do, as I observed before, and he soon understood ho^ 
to do it as well as 1, especially after he hid seen what the meaning of it uas 
and that it was to make bread of, for after that, I let him see me make 
bread, and bake it too, and in a little time, I riday was able to di all the vorl 
for me, as well as 1 could do it my self. \ 

I began now to consider that having two mouths to feed insroad of one ] 
must provide moie ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quamity of corn 
than I used to do, so I marked out a larger piece of land, and bej^n the fin« 
m the same manner as before, in which 1 riday worked not only very willing) 
and very hard, but did it v cry cheerfully and I told him what it w as for, thatii 
was for corn to make more bread, because he was now with me, and that] 
might have enough for him and myself too. I Ic appeared very sensible of tint 
part, and let me know that he thought 1 had much more 1 ibor upon me on k 
account, than 1 had for myself, and that he would woik the harder for me if 
I would tell him w hat to do 

This was the pleasantest )ear of all the life 1 led m this pi ice. Friday bcgji 
to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost everything I M 
occasion to call for, and of ever) place I had to send him to, and tilkcda 
great deal to me, so that, in shoit, 1 began now to have some use for it) 
tongue again, which, indeed, I had ver) little occasion for before. Besides rt( 
pleasure of talking to him, 1 had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself 
his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and 
began really to love the creature, and on his side, I believe he loved mt men 
than It was possible for him e\er to love anything before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country i 
and having taught him English so well that he could answer me almost an) 
question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to never conqucrec 
in battle^^* At which he smiled, and said, es, yes, we always fight the better, 
that is, he meant, always get the better in fight, and so we began the foliovwf 
discourse

-Yes, 1 have been here (points to the N. W. side of the island, which, 
fcems, was their side). 

this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the 
ges who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on the 
man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and, some time after, 
pi 1 took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly 
^tioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he was there once when 
^ ate up twenty men, mo women, and one child; he could not tell twenty 
English, but he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, and 
jting to me to tell them over. 

have told this passage, because it introduces what follows; that after this 
[)urse 1 had with him, I asked him how far it was from our island to the 
jre, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no 
r, no canoes ever lost, but that after a little way out to sea, there was a 
ent and wind, always one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. 

1 understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or 
ing in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draught 
reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which river, 
found afterwards, our island lay; and that this land which I perceived to 
W. and N. W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the 
ith of the river. 1 asked Friday a thousand questions about the country, 
inhabitants, the sea-coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he 
j with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the 
ral nations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs; 
ti whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees, which our maps 
;e on the part of America which reaches from the mouth of the River 
►onoko to Guiana, and onwards to St Martha. He told me, that up a great 
' beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which must 
from their country, there dwelt white, bearded men, like me, and 
ited to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had 
id much mans—that was his word; by all which I understood he meant the 
wards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole country, 
were remembered by all the nations from father to son. 
inquired if he could tell, me how I might go from this island, and get 
ig those white men; he told me, “Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe.” 
nd not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he

to relish very well; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one \ 
or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, 
that this poor savage might be a means to help me. 

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he be 
to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation 
religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him one time, who m 
him. The poor creature did not understand me at all, but thought 1 had asl 
him whom was his father: but 1 took it up by another handle, and asked fa 
who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and the hills and woodi, ] 
told me, ‘It was one Bcnamuckee, that lived beyond all;” he! could desen 
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, “much Wider,” hesii 
“than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars.” I asked mm then, ifd 
old person had made all things, why did not all things worship hun? He loob 
very grave, and, with a perfect look of innocence, said, “All tfiings say 0 
him.” I asked him, if the people who die in his country went away anywher 
He said, “Yes; they all went to Benamuckee.” Then I asked him whether tlo 
they eat up went thither too? He said, “Yes.” 

From these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true G« 
I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up town 
heaven; that He governed the world by the same power and providence li 
which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and could do everything fora 
give everything to us— take everything from us; and thus, by degrees, 1 opae 
his eyes. He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure the noio 
of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of makings 


prayers to God, and His being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told nieoi 
day, that if our God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he must needs De 
greater God than their Bcnamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and } 
could not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt] 
speak to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him? Hesai 
“No; they never went that were young men; none went thither but thed 
men,” whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made him explain Jtj 
me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say O (so he called savin 
prayers), and then came back and told them what Benamuckee said. By this 
observed, that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorat 
pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret of religion, in order I 
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not only to be fouj 
in the Roman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even among ^ 
most brutish and barbarous savages. ^ 

I endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told 
the pretence of their old men going up the mountains to say O to their 
Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he^ 
was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or spake with any^ 
there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then 1 entered into a long 
with him about the devil, the origin of him, his rebellion against 
enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark part^ ° ^ 
world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the many strata^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 133 


use of to delude mai^ind to their ruin; how he had a secret access to 
passions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so 
) cause us even to be our own tempters, and run upon our destruction by 
own choice. 

Found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the devil 
was about the being of a God: nature assisted all my arguments to evidence 
dm even the necessity of a great First Cause— an overruling, governing 
rer-a secret directing Providence; and of the equity and justice of paying 
^age to Him that made us, and the like; but there appeared nothing of this 
I in the notion of an evil spirit; of his origin, his bemg, his nature; and, above 
of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor 
ture puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and 
>cent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal 
im of the power of God, His omnipotence. His aversion to sin, His being a 
fuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us all, 
icould destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he listened with 
it seriousness to me all the while. After this, I had been telling him how 
devil was God’s enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and 
: to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of 


ist in the world, and the like. “Well,” says Friday, “but you say God is so 
ag, so great; is he not much strong, much might as the devil?” “Yes, yes,” 

1 1, “Friday; God is stronger than the devil: God is above the devil, and 
before we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable us 
esist his temptations and quench his fiery darts ” “But,” says he again, “if 
‘ much stronger, much might as the wicked devil, why God no kill the 
I, so make him no more do wicked?” I was strangely surprised at this 
ftion; and, after all, though 1 was now an old man, yet I was but a young 
tor, and ill-qualified for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and at first 1 
Id not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what 
^aid; but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so he 
^ated it in the very same broken words as above. By this time 1 had recovered 
telf a little, and I said, “God will at last punish him severely; he is reserved 
the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with ever- 
bg fire.” This did not satisfy Friday: but he returns upon me, repeating 
words, “ ^Reserve at lasfP me no understand: but why not kill the devU 
1^? not kill great ago?” “You may as well ask me,” said I, “why God does 
[kill you or me, when we do wicked things here that offend him: we are 
served to repent and be pardoned.” He mused some time on this. “Well, 
Mys he, mightily affectionately, “that well: so you, 1, devil, all wicked, 
preserve, repent, God pardon all.” Here I was run down again by him to 
[last degree: and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, 
Pgh they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and 
t Worship or homage due to t;he supreme being of God, as the consequence 
yet nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge of 
r and of redemption purchased for us; of a Mediator of the new 
pant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God’s throne; I say, nothing

but a revelation from heaven can form these in the soul; and that, therefo 
the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (I mean the Word of 
and the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his people, ] 
the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowlei 
of God, and the means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man, risings 
hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then sending him for sonii 
thing a good way off, I seriously prayed to God that he would enable me fi 
instruct savingly this poor savage; assisting, by His Spirit, the heart of \ 
poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of pod in < 
reconciling him to Himself, and would guide me to speak so to\him from t. 
Word of God, that his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, aiiij 
his soul saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long mscourse 
him upon the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, a 
of the doctrine of the gospel preached from heaven, viz.: of repentance towai 
God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as welli] 
could why our blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, 1 
the seed of Abraham; and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no shji 
in the redemption; that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, au] 
the like. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I toil 
for this poor creature’s instruction, and must acknowledge, what I beheveil 
that act upon the same prmciple will find, that in laying things open to him I 
really informed and instructed myself in many things that either I did not knoff, 
or had not fully considered before, but which occurred naturally to my 
upon searching into them, for the mformation of tins poor savage; and 1 1 
more affection in my inquiry after dungs upon this occasion than ever Ifel 
before: so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I 
had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat hglite! 
upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure: and vhea l 
reflected that in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had not ( ’ 
been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek the hand that had brouj 
me here, but was now to be made an instrument, under Providence, to savetl 
life, and, for aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him tot 
true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he might 
Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all 
things, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and I frequently rejo'*'’ 
that ever I was brought to this place, which I had so often thought the 
dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen me. 

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and 
conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was suen^ 
made the three years which we lived there togetlier perfectly and compW 
happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be found in a sublunff 
state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much better than i 

have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, ^ 
comforted* restored penitents. We had here the Word of God to read, ^

farther off from His Spirit to instruct, than if we had been m England I 
ays applied myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as well as I 
tld the meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries and 
■sdonings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture 
>wledge than I should ever have been by my own mere private reading, 
other thing I cannot refram from observing here also, from experience in 
1 retired part of my life, viz.: how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is 
t the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is 
plainly laid down in the Word of God, so easy to be received and under- 
jd, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of under- 
iding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of 
:cre repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salva- 
1 , to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God’s com- 
nds, and this without any teacher or instructor, 1 mean human; so the same 
in instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature, 
I bringing him to be such a Christian as 1 have known few equal to 
1 in my life. 

is to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention wffiich have happened 
:he world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of church 
^crnnient, they were all perfectly useless to us, and, for aught I can yet see, 
y have been so to the rest of the world. We had the sure guide to heaven, 
the Word of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the 


lit of God teaching and instructing by His Word, leading us into all truth, 
i nuking us both willing and obedient to the instruction of His Word. And 
annot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of 
Igion, which have made such confusion in the world, W'ould have been to us, 


ve could have obtained it; but I must go on with the historical part of things; 
] take every part in its order. 

Vftcr Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could 
Icrstand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though in broken 
glish, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at least so much of it 
related to my coming to this place; how 1 had lived there, and how long: I 
him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and 
ight him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully de- 
bited with; and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in Eng- 
d we wear hangers in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a 
:chct, v^hich was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but much more 
'ful upon other occasions. 

described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which I 
ne from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one 
Jther, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. 1 gave him an 
'Ount of the wreck which 1 had been on board of, and showed him, as near 
could, the place where she lay: but she was all beaten in pieces before, and 
showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and 
»ch 1 could not stir with my whole strength then; but was now fallen almost 
to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and 



136 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon. At last, says he, **Me 
such boat like come to place at my nation.” I did not understand him a o 
while; but, at last, when I had examined further into it, I understood byl 
that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country where 
lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I j 
ently imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon i 
coast, and the boat might get loose and drive ashore; but was so dull i 
never once thought of men making their escape from a wreck thither, .. 
less whence they might come: so I only inquired after a description of the 1, 

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to i 
derstand him when he added with some warmth, “We save tke white 
from drown.” Then I presently asked if there were any white mai^s, as he ( 
them, in the boat. “Yes,” he said; “the boat full of white mans.” I asked 
how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him then what be 
of them. He told me, “They live, they dwell at my nation.” 

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that „ 
might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight of 
island, as 1 now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, i 
they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were lam 
upon that wild shore among the savages. Upon this I inquired of him 
critically w hat was become of them. He assured me they hved still there, t 
they had been there about four years; that the savages left them alone, i 
give them victuals to live on. I asked him how it came to pass they did 
kill them and eat them. He said, “No, they make brother with them,” thai 
as I understood him, a truce; and then he added, “They no eat mans but ivl 
make the war fight,” that is to say, they never eat any men but such as com« 
fight with them, and are taken in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the 1 
at the east side of the island, from whence as 1 hav e said, I had, in a clear d 
discovered the main or continent of America, Friday, the weather being v 
serene, looks very earnestly towards the mam land, and, in a kmd of surpi 
falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some distai 
from him. 1 asked him what was the matter. “O joy!” says he; “O glad* tli 
see my country, there my nation!” I observed an extraordinary sense of pi 
ure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discove 
a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in* his own country again. T 
observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me, at t 
not so easy about my new man Friday as 1 w-as before; and I made no do 
but that, if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he would not c 
forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me, and would be forv^ 
enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, ^ 
a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he imgh* 
as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies, when they were takei 
war. But 1 wronged the poor, honest creature very much, for which I was v 
sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held me some we 
1 a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as bef< 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 137 

rhich I was certainly wrong too; the honest, grateful creature having no 
irht about it, but what consisted with the best principles, both as a religious 
.itian, and as a grateful friend; as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction, 
hiilc my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day pumping 
to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which 1 suspected 
2 in him; but I found everything he said was so honest and so innocent, that 
uld find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my uneasiness, 
[ladc me at last entirely his own again; nor did he in the least perceive that 
xs uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

Inc day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea so that 
fcould not see the continent, I called to him, and said, “Friday, do not you 
h yourself in your own country, your own nation?” “Yes,” he said, “I be 
ch 0 glad to be at my own nation.” “What would you do there?” said I: 
)uld you turn wild again, cat men’s flesh again, and be a savage, as you were 
He looked full of concern, and shaking his head said, “No, no, Fri- 
• tell them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread, 
ilc-flesh, milk; no eat man again.” “Why, then,” said 1 to him, “they will 
'^ou.” He looked grave at that, and then said, “No, no, they no kill me, 
y willing love learn.” He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He 
ed, they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I 
ed him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told me that 
jould not swim so far. 1 told him I would make a canoe for him. He told me 
mxAd go, if I would go with him. “I go!” says I; “why they will eat me 
conic there.” “No, no,” says he, “me make they no eat you; me make they 
ch love you.” He meant, he would tell them how 1 had killed his enemies, and 
jd his life, and so he would make them love me. Then he told me, as well as 
could, how kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he 
icd them, who came on shore there in distress. 

rom this time, I confess, 1 had a mind to venture over, and see if I could 
K»ibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were Spaniards 
I Portuguese; not doubting, but if I could, we might find some method to 
ape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good company together, 
ter than I could from an island forty miles ofl[ the shore, alone, and without 
p- So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by way of discourse, 
^ told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own nation; and ac- 
dingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the 
nd, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water), I 
^'ight it out, showed it him, and we both went into it. 1 found he was a most 
tcrous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift again 
could. So when he was in, I said to him, “Well, now Friday, shall wc go 
S^our nation?” He looked very dull at my saying so; which it seems was be- 
he thought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I had a bigger; 
he next day I went to the place where the first boat lay which I had made, 
I could not get into the water. He said that was big enough; but then 
I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years 
rc, the sun had split and dried it, that it was rotten. Friday told me such a 



138 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

boat would do very well, and would carry “much enough vittle, di 
bread;’ —that was his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going , 
with him to the continent, that I told him we would go and make one as 
as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word, but loo] 
very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him. He asked 
again, “Why you angry mad with Friday?— what me done?” I asked him ^ 
he meant. 1 told him I was not angry with him at all. “No angry!” says 
repeating the words several times; “why send Friday home away to m\ j 
tion?” “Why,” says I, “Friday, did not you say you wished you were then 
“Yes, yes,” says he, “wish we both there; no wish Friday there, n\) master ther

mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new life.” “Alas, I^ridai 
says I, “thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man ir 
self.” “Yes, yes,” says he, “you teachec me good, you teachee them good.” 
no, Friday,” says I, “you shall go without me; leave me here to live by ni}si 
as I did before.” He looked confused again at that word; and running to one 
the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it tor 
“What must 1 do with this?” says I to him. “You take kill Friday,” sa\si 
“What must 1 kill you for?” said I again. He returns very quick-“What} 
send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.” This he spt 
so earnestly that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, 1 so plainly disanei 
the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that 1 tc 
him then, and often after, that 1 would never send him away from me, if hc^ 
willing to stay wuth me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to me, ! 
that nothing could part him from me, so 1 found all the foundation of 
desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the peo[ 
and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing which, as I had no notion 
myself, so 1 had not the least thought or intention, or desire of undertaking 
But still I found a strong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on i 
supposition gathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen bear 
men there; and therefore without any more delay, I went to work with rri 
to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe 
undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the island to have bu 
little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good large vessels; but 
main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might wui 
it when it was made, to avoid the mistake 1 committed at first. 
pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew much better than 1 what kind o 
was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree^® 
down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between tna^ 
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same color and sm^l* ^

use, he did very handily; and in about a month’s hard labor, we finished it ai^ 
made it very handsome; especially, when with our axes, which I showed hiffl 
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a hom' 
After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight’s time to get her along, as 
were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water: but when she was in, 
would have carried twenty men with great ease. [ 

When she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see wi^il,* 
hat dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn her, anil 
paddle her along. So 1 asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in 
her. “Yes,” he said, ‘*we venture over in her very well, though great blow wind4^ 
However, 1 had a further design that he knew nothing of, and that was, to mat® 
a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that w«S 
easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight )'Oung cedar tree, which | 
found near the place, and which there were great plenty of in the island, and | 
set Friday to work to cut it down, and give him directions how to shape and 
order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails, 
or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them now six-and-twentjr' 
years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that 
I should ever have this kind of use for them, 1 did not doubt but they were 
rotten; and indeed most of them were so. However, 1 found two pieces, which 
appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work; and with a great deal d 
pains, and awkw ard stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length 
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of^ 
mutton sail, to go wdth a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top^ I 
such as usually our ships’ long-boats sail with, and Such as 1 best knew how I 
manage, as it was such a one as 1 had to the boat in which I made my escapi^ I 
from Barbary, as related in the first part of my story. 1 

1 was near two months performing this last w^ork, viz.: rigging and fitting I 
my mast and sails, for 1 finished them very complete, making a small stay, anl j 
a sail, or foresail to it, to assist if we should turn to windward; and what Wi(ft | 
more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with, I was but 1 
bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such g 
thing, 1 applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last 1 brought it to 
pass; though, considering the many dull contrivances 1 had for it that failed^ 1 
think it cost me almost as much labor as making the boat. 4 

After all this was done I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged 
the navigation of my boat: for though he knew very well how to paddle t 
canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was thft 
most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by thg 
rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this way or that way, as the courh^j 
we sailed changed; 1 say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and 
amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and | 
he became an expert sailor, except that of the compass I could make him undei^^ ‘ 
stand very little. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather*^ 
and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for g 
compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night and the shore by dayi/

in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad cither by 
land or sea. \ . 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in this 
|plilC6; though the three last years that I had this creature with me ought 
raldher to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of another 
%itid than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing 
l^e with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first; and if I 
iiad such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, having 
such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and the great 
hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered, for I had an invirfcible 
impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I 
should not be another year in this place. 1 went on, however, with my Hus- 
bandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. 1 gathered and cured my 
grapes, and did every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy seavson was, in the mean time, upon me, when I kept more within 
doors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we 


could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I 
landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water 
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold her, 
and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in; and then, when 
the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out; and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea: and to keep the 
rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as well 
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the months of November and 


December, in which I designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design 
returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage. And 
the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being 
the stores for our voyage, and intended, in a week or a fortnight’s time, to 
Open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon some- 
thing of this kind, when I called to Friday and bade him to go to the sea- 
shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally 
, got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not 
been long gone when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, 
or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and 
( before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, “O master! O master! 
sorrow! O bad^” “What’s the matter, Friday?” says I. “O yonder there,” 
he, “one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!” By this way of speaking, 
'I concluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there were but three. 
'*^eU, Friday,” says I, “do not be frightened.” So 1 heartened him up as well 
X could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for 
.Isothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, s^nd would 
lent him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so that 1 scarcely 
nditt to do with him. 1 comforted him as well as I could, and told him 
in ^ much danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him. 
Mys I, “Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?” 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



“Me shoot,” says he, ‘*but there come many great number,” “No matter 
that,” said I again; “our guns will fright them that we do not kill” So I ask^ 
him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and 


by me, and do just as I bade him. He said, “Me die, when you bid di& 
master.” So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I ha#^ 
been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had 
drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always cardedi 
and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets. Then f 
took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five small bullets eac% 
and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each. I hung my gr^^ 
sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I hm 
thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-glass, and went up to the dde 
of the hill, to see what 1 could discover; and I found quickly by my glaa% 
that there were onc-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoei| 
and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet up09il 
these three human bodies; a barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more tnan^ 
as I had observed, was usual with them. I observed also, that they had landei|^ 
not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to mjT 
creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost 


down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand thmt 


wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again 
to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them aUi 
and asked him if he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, andi 
his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very 
cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when 1 bid die, ^ 

In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before, between 
us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon hjia 
shoulder, and 1 took one pistol and the other three guns myself; and ill 
this posture we marched out. 1 took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, anil 
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, | 
charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anythil^ 
till 1 bade him, and in the mean time not to speak a word. In this posture 1 
fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over 
creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within snot of them 
before 1 should be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to dklif 
While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began 
abate my resolution:— I do not mean that I entertained any fear of th^ 
number, for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior 
to them— nay, though 1 had been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, whm 
call, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was in to go and dip my bands 
in blood, to attack people who had neither done or intended me any wror^l 
who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own 
disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God’s having left them, with thsi 
other nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman} 
courses, but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actionii^ 
much less an executioner of His justice,— that whenever He thought fit Ifti 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

would take the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish 
them as a people for national crimes, but that, in the mean time, it was none 
of my business,— that it was true Friday might justify it, because he was a 
declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular people, and it 
was lawful for him to attack them,— but 1 could not say the same with regard 
to myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way 
as I went, that I resolved 1 would only go and place myself near them that I 
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as God should 
direct; but that unless something offered that was more a call to me thanj yet I 
knew of, I would not meddle with them. 1 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible wariness 
and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I came t^ the 
skirt of the wood on the side which was next to them, only that one edrner 
of the wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and 
showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade 
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there plainly what they 
were doing. He did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they 
might be plainly viewed there,— that they were all about their fire eating the 
flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a 
little from them, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the very 
soul within me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the 
bearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was 
filled with horror at the very naming of the white, bearded man; and going 
to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon the beach 
of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, 
and that he was a European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards 
nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a little way 
about, I saw 1 might come at undiscovered, and that then I should be within 
half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though 1 was indeed enraged 
to the highest degree; and going back about twenty paces, I got behind some 
bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree, and then came 
to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view of them at the distance 
of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches 
sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other 
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb to 
their fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands^at his feet. I turned 
to Friday. ‘‘Now, Friday,” said I, “do as 1 bid thee.” Friday said he would. 
“Then, Friday,” says I, “do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.” So I 
set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and 
Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket 1 took my aim at the 
lavages, bidding him to do the like; then asking him if he was ready, he said, 
“Then fire at them,” said I; and at the same moment I fired also. 

' Ikiday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he shot 
Idlieo two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I killed one, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 44» ^ 

and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation; 
and all of them that were not hurt Jumped upon their feet, but did not imine»* ' 
diately know which way to run, or which way to look, for they knew noU 
from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon m< 
that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so, as soon as the firsl 
shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and 
Friday did the like; he saw me cock and present; he did the same again, “Atie 
you ready, Friday?” said 1. “Yes,” says he. “Let fly then,” says I, “in the name 
of God!” and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did 
Friday; and as our pieces were now loaded with what 1 call swan-shot, or smajB 
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded, that 
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most 
of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly after, though 
not quite dead. 

“Now, Friday,” says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up th<J 
musket which was yet loaded, “follow me,” which he did with a great deaii 
of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and 
Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted ais 
loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as fast as I could, 
which by the way was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I mad^ 
directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach 
or shore, between the place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers 
who were just going to work with him had left him at the surprise of our 
first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the seaside, and had jumped into ^ 
canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. 1 turned to Friday, and 
bade him step forwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and 
running about forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and I thought 
he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though 
I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of them, and 
wounded the third so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had 
been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the 
flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted hiix; 
up, and asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered in 
Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand or 
speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that 
he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate* 
Then I asked him what countryman he was: and he said Espagniole; and 
being a little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make^ 
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. “Seignior,” said I, with aa 
much Spanish as I could make up, “we will talk afterwards, but we must fight 
now; if you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about 
you.” He took them very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his 
hands, but, as if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his murdererss 
like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as 
dje whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much fright-* 



WORKS OF DA>J1EL DEFOE 

V 

with the noise of our pieces that they fell down for mere amazement 
fear, and had no more power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh 
to resist our shot: and that was the case of those five that Friday shot at 
in the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they received, so the other 
ewo fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep my 
charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so I 
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, 
and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, which he did 
with great swiftness; and then giving him my musket, I sat down myJelf to 
load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they wanted. While 
I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the 
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their great 
wooden swords, the weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not 
prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, 
ithough weak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great 
wounds on his head; but the savage, being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in 
with him, had thrown him dowm, being faint, and w^as wringing my sword 
out of his hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the 
sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and 
lolled him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him, could come 
near him. 

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, with no 
weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he despatched those three 
"who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he 
could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, 1 gave him 
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages, and 
wounded them both; but, as he was not able to run, they both got from him 
into the wood, where Friday pursued them and killed one of them, but 
the other was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had 
plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might off to those two 
who were left in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with one wounded, 
tJiat we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands, 
of one-and-twenty. The account of the whole is as follows: —three killed at 
ipiUJt first shot from the tree; two killed at the next shot; tw'^o killed by Friday 
in the boat; two killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Fri- 
day in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found 
dropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of 
them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead— twenty- 
cne in alL 

Those that were in the canoe w^orked hard to get out of gunshot, and 
dbough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any 
of them, Friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue 
and, indeed, 1 was very anxious about their escape, lest carrying the 
IMiWs hoxpe to their people, they should come back perhaps with two or 
three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 111 

to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, aul 
bade Friday follow me; but when 1 was in the canoe, I was s^rised to 
another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, fojp 
the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matterj| 
for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied 
so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really but 
little life in him. ^ 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound bint 
with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak, bt^s 
groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only uabounil 
.in order to be killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, 
and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him give th#, 
poor wretch a dram; which, with the news of his being delivered, revived hinii 
and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and lool^ 
in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how Friday 
kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about^ 
danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own race and head; 
and then sung and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a goc4 
while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter; 
but vdien he came a little to himself, he tcld me that it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and 
filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father, and 
of his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extrava-* 
gances of his affection after this: for he went into the boat, and out of the 
boat, a great many times: when he went in to him, he would sit down by 
him, open his breast, and hold his father’s head close to his bosom for many 
minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which wexia 
numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with Id$ 
hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of tny 
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savageSl^ 
who were now almost out of sight: and it was happy for us that we di^ 
not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they could be got 
a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and mat 
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could not suppose theit 
boat could live, or that they ever reached their own coast. 

But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his father, that I could ncH 
find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought he 
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping and laughing^ 
And pleased to the highest extreme; then I asked him if he had given his father; 
finy bread. He shook his head, and said, “None; ugly dog eat all up self ” I 
then gave him a cake of bread, out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; I 
also gave him a dram for himself; but he would not taste it, but carried it 0 
Ins father, I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins; so I gave him 
a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his father these 
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run away as if he had be^

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

bewitched, for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: 
I say, he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; 
and though I called and hallooed out too, after him, it was all one— away he 
went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, though not 
so fast as he went; as he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, because he 
had something in his hand. When he came up to me, I found he had been 
quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, 
and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread: the bread he gave 
me, but the water he carried to his father; however, as I was very thirsty/ too, I 
took a little of it. The water revived his father more than all the rmm or 
spirits I had given him, for he was fainting with thirst. \ 

When his father had drank, I called to him to know if there was any water 
left: he said “Yes;” and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was m as 
much want of it as his father; and 1 sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, 
to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself 
upon a green place under the shade of a tree; and whose limbs were also very 
stiff, and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with. 
When I saw that upon Friday’s coming to him with the water he sat up and 
drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a 
handful of raisins; he looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude 
and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, 
notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not 
stand up upon his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but was really 
not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit 
still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had 
done his father’s. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or perhaps 
less, all the while he was here, turn his head about, to see if his father was 
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at last he found 
he was not to be seen; at which he started up, and, without speaking a word, 
flew with that swifmess to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to 
touch the ground as he went: but when he came, he only found he had laid 
himself down to ease his limbs; so Friday came back to me presently; and 
then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead 
him to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would 
take care of him. But Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon 
his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon 
the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then 
lifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently stepping out 
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could 
walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both safe 
into our creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other 
catioe. As he passed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He 
told me, “Go fetch more boat:” so away he went like the wind, for sure 
man or horse ran like him; and he had the other canoe in the creek 
as soon as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then went 




ROBINSON CRUSOE Uf 

to help our new ^ests out of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of 
them able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to 
bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind 
of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up 
together upon it between us. 

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we 
were at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over, 
and 1 was resolved not to break it down; so 1 set to work again, and Friday 
and I, in about two hours’ time, made a very handsome tent, covered with old 
sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our 
outward fence, and between that and the grove of our young wood which 
1 had planted, and heie we made them two beds of such things as I had; viz,: 
of good ricc-straw, with blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover 
them, on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects; 
and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king I 
looked. First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that I nad 
an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectly sub- 
jected 1 was absolutely lord and lawgiver: they all owed their lives to me, and 
vere ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me. 
It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three 
different religions: my man Friday w’^as a Protestant, his father was a Pagan 
and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist. However, 1 allowed liberty 
of conscience throughout my dominions. But this is by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given them 
shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some pro-^ 
vision for them: and the first thing I did, 1 ordered Friday to take a yearling 
goat, betwixt a Idd and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed; when 
1 cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday 
to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure you, 
of flesh and broth; and as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within 
niy inner wall, so 1 carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table 
there for them, I sat dowm, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as 
well as I could, cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter^ 
especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke 
the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of the 
canoes, and go fetch our muskets and other firearms, which for want of time, 
we had left upon the place of battle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go 
and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and 
would presently be offensive. I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains 
of their barbarous feast, which I could not think of doing myself: nay, I 
could not bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he punctually per- 
formed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there; so that 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

when I went again, 1 could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the 
comer of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects; 
and first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape 
of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them, 
with a power too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages 
in the boat never could live out the storm which bJew that night they went 
off, but must, of necessity, be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, 
where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned aif they 
were cast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on\ shore, 
he said he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they were so dre^fully 
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and th<p fire, 
that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder 
and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared, viz.: 
Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy 
them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew; because he heard 
them all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it was impossible 
for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill 
at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now: and this old 
savage was in the right; for as I understood since, by other hands, the savages 
never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified 
by the accounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), 
that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed 
by fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and therefore was under 
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, 
with all my army; for, as there were now four of us, I would have ventured 
upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their coming 
wore off; and 1 began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main 
into consideration; being likewise assured, by Friday’s father, that I might 
depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go. 
But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious discourse with 
the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his 
countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been cast away and made their 
e^ape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the 
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from 
the Rio de la Plata to the Havana, being directed to leavfe their loading there, 
which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods 
tJtcy could meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, 
whom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men were 
drowned, when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite 
dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where 
ihey expected to have been devoured every moment. He told me they had 
some arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had 
iH||ldther powder nor ball, the washing of tne sea having spoiled all their powder 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 1# 

but a little» which they used at their first landing, to provide thems^est 
some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had 
formed any design of making their escape. He said they had many consultah 
tions about it; but that, having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, not 
provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair. I 
asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from me, which 
might tend towards an escape; and, whether, if they were all here, it might 
not be done, I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill 
usage of me, if I put my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent 
virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings by the 
obligations they had received, so much as they did by the advantages they 
expected. I told him it would be very hard that I should be the instrument of 
their deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner 
in New Spam, where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what 
necessity, or what accident soever brought him thither; and that I had rath^ 
be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the merci« 
less claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I added that, 
otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many 
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils 
southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in requital, 
they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force 
among their own people, 1 might be ill used for my kindness to them, and 
make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candor and ingenuousness, that their coflh 
dition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he believed 
they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that should con- 
tribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them, with 
the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return again, and bring 
me their answer; that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn 
oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction, as their commander 
and captain; and they should swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel, 
to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as I should agree to, and 
no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they 
were landed safely in such country as I intended; and that he would bring 
a contract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me 
he mnld first swear to me himself, that he would never sdr from me ait 
long as he lived, till I gave him orders; and that he would take my side iR 
the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith 
among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil, honest 
nien, and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neithet 
Weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the 
savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he 
Was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible, 
and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But when 



150 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


he had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an 
objection, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much sin- 
cerity on the other hand, that 1 could not but be very well satisfied in it; 
and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half 
a year. The case was thus: he had been with us now about a month, during 
which time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assist- 
ance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what stock of 
corn and rice I had laid up; which, though it was more than sufficient for 
myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, 
now it was increased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his 
countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come ovir; and 
least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should builSd one, 
for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America; so he told tne he 
thought it would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and 
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we 
should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of corn for his 
countrymen, when they should come; for want might be a temptation to 
them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out 
of one difficulty into another. “You know,” says he, “the children of Israel, 
though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled 
even against God himself, that delivered them, when they came to want bread 
in the wilderness.” 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not but 
be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his 
fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden tools 
we were furnished with permitted; and, in about a month’s time, by the 
end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed 
up, as we sowed two-and-tv enty bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, 
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare: indeed, we left ourselves 
barely sufficient for our own food for the six months that we had to expect our 
crop; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; 
for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us 
out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been 
very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found occasion; 
and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, 
^ least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For this purpose, 1 marked 
out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, an5 I set Friday and his 
father to cut them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom 1 imparted 
tny thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed them 
with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and 
I caused them to do the like, till they had made about a dozen large planks 
oi good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches 
to four inches thick: what prodigious labor it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as 
: much as I could; and, for this purpose, I made Friday and the Spaniard go out 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 1S1 

one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took onr turns), and 
by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; 
for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our 
flock. But, above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I caused 
such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we 
been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled 
sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, formed a great part of 
our food-very good living too, I assiire you, for they are exceeding nourishing* 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most plenti- 
ful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to answer 
our end; for, from twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in and thrashed 
out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in proportion of 
the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though 
all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready 
for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have car- 
ried us to any part of the world, that is to say, any part of America. When we 
had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make 
more wicker-ware, viz.: great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard 
was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did 
not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it. 

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I gave 
the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do with 
those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not to bring 
any man with him who w^ould not swear, in the presence of himself and the 
old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the person he 
should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them in order to 
their deliverance; but that they should stand by him and defend him against 
all such attempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under and 
subjected to his command; and that this should be put in writing, and signed in 
their hands. How they were to have done this, when I knew they had neither 
pen nor ink, was a question which wc never asked. Under these instructions, 
the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of 
the canoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought 
in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each 
of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder 
and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and not to use 
either of them but upon urgent occasions. 

Ihis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view 
of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them 
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many 
days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days’ time; and wishing 
them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them about a signal they 
should hang out at their return, by which I should know them again, when 
they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore. They went away, 
With a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, by my account in the 
nionth of October; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had once

lotst; it, I could never recover it again; nor had I kept even the number of years 
m punctually as to be sure I was right; though, as it proved, when I after- 
Wajras examined my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange and 
unforeseen accident intervened, of which like has not, perhaps, been heard 
of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday 
came running in to me, and called aloud, “Master, master, they are come, 
they are come!” I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as 
I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the Way, was 
by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, 1 
went out without my arms, which was not my custom to do: but I was 
surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat a\ about 
a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulifler-of- 
mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: 
also I observed, presently, that they did not come from the side which the 
shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this 1 called 
Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we looked 
for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. 
In the next, I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see what I could make 
of them; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, 
as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view 
the plainer, without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the 
hill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two 
leagues and a half distance from me S. S. E., but not above a league and a 
half from the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to be an English 
ship, and the boat appeared to be an English longboat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a ship, 
and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen, 
and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe, but yet I had some 
secret doubts hung about me— I cannot tell from whence they came— bidding 
me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider 
what business an English ship could have in that part of the world, since it 
was not the way to or from any part of the world where the English had 
any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there, in 
distress; and that if they were really English, it was most probable that they 
were here upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I was, than 
fall into the hands of tliievcs and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which sometimes 
are given him v^hen he may think there is no possibility of its being real. 
That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that have made any 
Observations of things can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an 
invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the tendency 
of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they 
iare from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, 
ta not the question), and that they are given for our good^ 

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this reason- 



ROBINSON C31USOE 1 % 

ing; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition, come it 
from whence it will, 1 had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condt^ 
rion than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept myself long in 
this posture, till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a 
creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing; however, as they did 
not come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly 
landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half 
a mile from me; which was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have 
landed just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out 
of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were 
on shore, I was fully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; 
one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all 
eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought^ 
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they 
took those three out of the boat, as prisoners; one of the three I could perceive 
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even 
to a kind of extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up dxeir 
hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree aa 
the first. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the 
meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as be 
could, “O master! you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans.** 
“Why, Friday,” says I, “do you think they are going to eat them, then? “Yes,** 
says Friday, “they will eat them.” “No, no,” says 1, “Friday; I am afraid they 
will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure they will not eat them.’* 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood 
trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the 
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up 
his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one 
of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every moment; at which 
all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily 
now for the Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that I had 
any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might haVe 
secured the three men, for 1 saw no fire-arms they had among them; but it 
fell out to my mind another way. After I had observed the outrageous usage of 
the three men by the insolent seamen, 1 observed the fellows run scattering 
about the island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the 
three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat 
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair. 
This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore, and began to 
look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked round 
nie; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the tree all 
^ght, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing, that 
night, of the supply 1 was to receive by the providential driving of the ship 
nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been so long 
nourished and supported, so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how 
certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to them, and 



154 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety, at the same 
time that they thought themselves lost, and their case desperate. So little do 
we see before us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheer- 
fully upon the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures 
so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst circumstances, they have always 
something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer deliverance than they 
imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which 
they seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at high water when these people came on shore; and v^hile they 
rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly 
staid till the tide was spent, and the water •was ebbed considerably away, 
leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in the boat, who, a^ I found 
afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell asleep; however, one 
of them, waking a little sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast 
aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about; 
upon which they all soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to 
launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a 
soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, 
who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave 
it over, and away they strolled about the country again; and 1 heard one of 
them say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, “Why, let her 
alone, Jack, can’t you^ she’ll float next tide;” by 'which I was fully confirmed 
in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this while I kept 
myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle, any farther than 
to my place of observation, near the top of the hill: and very glad 1 was to 
think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before 
the boat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might 
be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if they 
had any. In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though 
with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than 
1 had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman 
•with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, 
and I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my 
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked 
sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it was 
dark; but about two o’clock, being the heat of the day, I found that they were 
all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep. 
The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get any 
sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a 
quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. 
Upon this 1 resolved to discover myself to them, and learn something of their 
condition; immediately I marched as above, my man Friday at a good distance 
behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring 
a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could, 
and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


155 

“What are ye, gentlemen?” They started up at the noise^ but were ten times 
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made. 
They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly 
from me, when I spoke to them in English. "Gentlemen,” said I, "do not be 
surprised at me; perhaps you may have a friend near, when you did not 
expect it.” "He must be sent directly from Heaven then,” said one of them 
very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me; “for our 
condition is past the help of man.” "All help is from Heaven, sir,” said I: 
“but can you put a stranger in the way to help you? for you seem to be in 
some great distress, I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to 
make application to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift 
up his sword to kill you.” 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking 
like one astonished, returned, "Am 1 talking to God, or man? Is it a real man, 
or an angel?” "Be in no fear about that, sir,” said 1; "if God had sent an 
angel to relieve you, he' would have come better clothed, and armed after 
another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your fears; 1 am a man, an 
Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I have one servant only; we 
have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve you? What is your 
case?” "Our case, sir,” said he, "is too long to tell you, while our murderers 
arc so near us; but, in short, sir, I was commander of that ship; my men have 
mutinied against me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, 
and, at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men 
vith me,— one my mate, the other a passenger,-~wherc we expected to perish, 
believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.” 
“Where are these brutes, your enemies?” said 1; “do you know where they are 
gonc^” "There they lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; “my heart 
trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, they 
v ill certainly murder us all.” "Have they any fire-arms? ” said I. He answered^ 
“They had only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat.” "Well, then,” 
said 1, "leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to 
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prisoners?” He told me there were 
two desperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy 
to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their 
duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that distance 
distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct. 
‘ Well,” says I, "let us retreat out of t^heir view or hearing, lest they awake, and 

will resolve further.” So they willingly went back with me, till the woods 
covered us from them, 

‘Look you, sir,” said 1, "if I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing 
to make two conditions with me?” He anticipated my proposals by telling me 
tnat both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and com- 
inanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not recovered, he would live 
and die with me in what part of the world soever I would send him; and the 
^0 other men said the same. "Well,” says I, "my conditions arc but two; 
urst,— that while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to any

authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, 
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and 
m the mean time be governed by my orders; secondly,— that if the ship is or 
may be recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free.” 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could 
devise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and besides 
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as 
he lived. “Well, then,” said I, “here are three muskets for you, with powder 
and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done.” Hi showed all 
the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholl) 
guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing anythmg; but the 
best method 1 could think of was to fire on them at once as they \ lay, and if 
any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we plight sau 
them, and so put it wholly upon God’s providence to direct the shot. He said, 
very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it; but that 
those two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the 
mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still, for they 
would go on board and bring the whole ship’s company, and destroy us all 
“Well, then,” says I, “necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way 
to save our lives.” However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told 
him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon after 
we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them were the 
heads of the mutiny. He said, “No.” “Well, then,” said I, “you may let them 
escape, and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to save 
themselves. Now,” says I, “if the rest escape you, it is your fault.” Animated 
with this, he took the musket 1 had given him in his hand, and a pistol in 
his belt, and his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand, the 
two men who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which one 
of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried 
out to the rest; but it was too late then, for tlie moment he cried out thev 
fired— I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They 
had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them was 
killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded, but not being dead, 
he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the 
captain, stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should 
call upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him dov^n 
with the stock of his musket, so that he never spolce more: there were three 
more in the company, and one of them was slightly wounded. By this tjme 
I was come, and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, 
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would spare their lives ir 
they would give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they 
had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the 
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came* 
They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be desired, an 
he was willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not against, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 157 

only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were 
on the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s mate to the boat, 
with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they did; 
and by and by three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from 
the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing the captain, who 
was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound 
also; and so our victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another’s 
circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history, which he heard 
with an attention even to amazement,--and particularly at the wonderful 
manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed, 
as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. But 
when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been 
preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and 
he could not speak a word more. After this communication was at an end, 
1 carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where 
1 came out, viz.: at the top of the house, where I refreshed him with such 
pro\ision as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had made during 
my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above all, 
the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed my 
retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been now planted near twenty 
years, and the trees growing much faster than in England, was become a little 
wood, so thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at that one side 
where I had reserved my little winding passage into it. I told him this was my 
castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes 
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and 1 would show him that too 
another time; but at present our business was to consider how to recover the 
ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss what 
measures to take, for that there were still siK-and-twenty hands on board, who, 
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their 
lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry 
it on, knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows 
as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and that, 
therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a number, as we 
weie. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a very 
national conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on speed- 
as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to 
prevent their landing upon us and destroying us. Upon this it presently oc- 
curred to me that in a little while the ship’s crew, wondering what was become 
of their comrades and of the boat, w^ould certainly come on shore in their other 
ooat to look for them, and that then, perhaps, they might come armed, and 
he too strong for us: this he allowed to be rational. Upon this, 1 told him the 
hrst thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so 



158 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


that they might not carry her off, and taking everything out of her, leave hei 
so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took 
the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found 
there,— which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a 
horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was 
five or six pounds); all which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy 
and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, m^st, sail, and 
rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a greajt hole in her 
bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet th^y could not 
carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that ye could be 
able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went away Without the 
boat, I did not much question to make her again fit to carry us to the Leeward 
Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them stiJI 
in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main strength, 
heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would not float her off 
at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be 
quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we should do, we heard the 
ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to 
come on board: but no boat stirred; and they fired several times, making other 
signals for the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, 
and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, 
hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore; and ue found, as they 
approached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they had fire- 
arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of 
them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the tide having 
set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to 
come to the same place where the other had landed, and where the boat lay, 
by this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain knew the 
persons and characters of ail the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were 
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by 
the rest, being overpowered and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who 
it seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were as out- 
rageous as any of the ship’s crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their 
new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too 
powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances 
were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every condition that could 
be was better than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect 
that the consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. 
I asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a 
deliverance were not worth venturing for? “And where, sir,” said I, “is your 
belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated 
you a little while ago? For my part,” said I, “there seems to be but one thing 
amiss in all the prospect of it.” “What is that?” says he. “Why,” said I, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 159 

that, as you say, there are three or four honest fellows among them, which 
should be spared; had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should 
have thought God’s providence had singled them out to deliver them into your 
hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall 
die or live as they behave to us.” As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheer- 
ful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so wc set vigorously to 
our business. 

Wc had, upon the first appearance of the boats coming from the ship, con- 
sidered of separating our prisoners; and we had indeed, secured them effec- 
tually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, 1 
sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my cave, where they 
were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered, or of 
finding their way out of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves: 
here they left them bound, but gave them provisions; and promised them, if 
they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two; but 
if they attempted their escape, they should be put to death without mercy. 
They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were 
very thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light 
left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as wc made ourselves) for their 
comfort: and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the 
entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned, 
indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other two we^e 
taken into my service, upon the captain’s recommendation, and upon their sol- 
emnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the three honest men 
\u‘ were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt wc should be able to 
deal well enough with the ten that w^crc coming, considering that the captain 
had said there were three or four honest men among them also. As soon as they 
got to the place where the other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, 

, and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, 
for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some dis- 
tance from the shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we should 
not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran 
all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise 
to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her 
bottom. After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or three great 
I shouts hallooing with all their might, to try if they could make their compan- 
1 ions hear; but all was to no purpose: then they came all close in a ring, and 
, fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes 
niade the woods ring: but it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure, could 
not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst 
pve no answer to them. They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, 
as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship, 
and let them know that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved; 

they immediately launched their boat again, and got all of them 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing 
they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades ov^ 
for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should 
have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived theiti all 
coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct, which it 
seems they consulted together upon, viz.; to leave three men in the boat, and 
the rest go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows. This 
was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss whatito do, as our 
seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the 
boat escape; because they would row away to the ship, and theA the rest of 
them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would 
be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what ^e issue of 
things might present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who re- 
mained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came 
to an anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them 
in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together, marching towards 
the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay; and we could see them 
plainly, though they could not perceive us. We should have been very glad 
if they would ha^e come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them, 
or that they would have gone farther off, that we might come abroad. But 
when they were come to the brow of the hill w here they could see a great way 
into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and where 
the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary: and not 
caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they 
sat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought fit to have 
gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had done the )ob 
for us; but they were too full or apprehensions of danger to venture to go to 
slej^, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of theiis, 
viz.: that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to endeavor to make their 
fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when 
their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we shoiiM 
have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal, provided it was done while 
we were near enough to come up to them before they could load their pieces 
again. But this event did not happen; and wc lay still a long time, very irreso- 
lute what course to take. At length, I told them there would be nothing done, 
in my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps 
we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use sonie 
stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a great 
while, though very impatient for their removing, and were very uneasy, when 
after a long consultation, we saw them all start up, and march down towards 
the sea; it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the 
place, that they resolved to go on board the ship again, giving their conipati" 
ions over for lost, and so go on their intended voyage with the ship. 

'' y As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be, ns it 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 161 

really was, that they had given over their search, and were going back again; 
and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the 
apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back 
again, and which ansv^ered my end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the cajp- 
tain’s'inate to go over the little creek westward, toviards the place where the 
savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so soon as they came to 
a little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo out, as 
loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as 
soon as ever they heard the seamen ansucr them, they should return it again; 
and then keeping out of sight, take a round, alw ays answering hen the others 
hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, and among the woods, as possible, 
and then wheel about again to me by such ways as 1 directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed; and 
they presently heard them, and, answering, ran along the shore westward, 
towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where, 
the vatcr being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to come 
up and set them over; as, indeed, 1 expected. When they had set themselves 
over, 1 observed that tlic boat being gone a good way in into the creek, and, 
as it were, in a harbor within the land, they took one of the three men out 
of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened 
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This w’^as what I wished for; and 
immediately leaving Friday and the captain’s mate to their business, I took the 
rest with me, and crossing the crock out of their sight we surprised the two 
men before they w ere aw arc; one of them lying on shore, and the other being 
in the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going 
to start up: the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked 
him down; and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead 
man. There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, 
when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this 
w^as, it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the 
rest of the crew; and, therefore, was easily persuaded not only to yield, but 
afterwards to join very sincerely with us. In the mean time, Friday and the 
captain’s mate so well managed their business with the rest, that they drew 
them, by hallooing and answ ering, from one hill to another, and from one wood 
to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where they 
were very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark; and, 
indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back 
to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall 
^pon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours after 
Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and we could 
hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those 
behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain how 
lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster; which was very 
^elcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it is impossible 
0 express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek,

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to one 
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into 
an enchanted island; that cither there were inhabitants in it, and they should 
all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should be 
all carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two com^ 
rades by their names a great many times: but no answer. After some time, we 
could see them, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their hands 
like men in despair, and sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to 
rest themselves; then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the same 
thing over again. My men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon 
them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take tliem at some advantage, 
so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was 
unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing the others were 
very well armed. 1 resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate; and, there- 
fore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday 
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground 
as they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as near them as they 
could possibl)% before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was the 
principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most de- 
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them with two more 
of the crew: the captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so much 
in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so near as 
to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before; but when they came 
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The 
boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man w as shot in the body, and 
fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third 
ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immccJiatcly advanced with my whole 
army, which was now eight men; viz.: myself generalissimo; Friday, my lieu- 
tenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war 
whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, 
so that they could not see our number; and I made the man they had left in 
the boat, w^ho was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring 
them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce them to terms; which fell out 
just as we desired: for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition then was, 
they would be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could 
to one of them, “Tom Smith! Tom Smith!” Tom Smith answered immediately, 
“Is that Robinson?” for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered, “Ay, 
ay; for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw dowm your arms and yield, or you are 
all dead men this moment.” “Who must we yield to? Where are they?”' says 
Smith again. “Here they are,” says he; “here’s our captain, and fifty men with 
him, have been hunting you these two hours; the boatswain is killed. Will Fry 
is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are all lost.” 
“Will they give us quarter then?” says Tom Smith, “and we will yield.” “I’U 
go and ask, if you promise to yield,” said Robinson: so he asked the captain; 
and the captain himself then called out, “You, Smith, you know my voice; if 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 163 

you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all 
but Will Atkins.” 

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, “For God’s sake, captain, give me quarter; 
what have I done? They have all been as bad as I;” which by the way, was 
not true: for it seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that had hold of the 
captain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously in tying his hands, 
and giving him injurious language. However, the captain told him he must lay 
down his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor’s mercy; by which he 
meant me, for they all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down their 
arms, and begged their lives; and 1 sent the man that had parleyed with them, 
and two more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, 
which, with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, 
and upon their boat; only that 1 kept myself and one more out of sight, for 
reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship: and as 
for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with 
them upon the villainy of their practices with him, and upon tlie further wick- 
edness of their design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery and 
distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They all appeared very peni- 
tent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they were not 
his prisoners, but the commander’s of the island; that they thouglit they had 
set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to 
direct them, that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman; 
that he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all 
quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there 
as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor 
to advise to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect; 
Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede with the governor 
for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God’s sake, that they might not 
be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was come, and that 
it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting 
possession of the ship; so 1 retired in the dark from them, that they might not 
see what kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to me; when I 
called, at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, and say 
to the captain, “Captain, the commander calls for you;” and presently the 
captain replied, “Tell his Excellency, I am just coming.” This more perfectly 
amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was just by, with his 
fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing 
the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put in execution the 
next morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of 
success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take 
Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the 
cave where the others lay. This was committed to Friday and the two men 
>^ho came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave as to 



164 WORKS OP DANIEL DEFOE 

^ prison; and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in their condi- 
tion. The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a 
full description: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was 
secure enough, considering they were upon their behavior. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a parley 
with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought they might 
be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of 
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and that though 
the governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present action, 
yet that if they were sent to England, they would all be hanged in chains; but 
that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would 
have the governor’s engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men 
in their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, 
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the last 
drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all 
over the world; that they would own him as a father to them as long as they 
lived. “Well,” says the captain, “I must go and tell the governor what you say, 
and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it.” So he brought me an 
account of the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed they 
would be faithful. However, that we might be very secure, I told him he 
should go back again and choose out those five, and tell them, that they might 
see he did not want men, that he would take out those five to be his assistants, 
and that the governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent 
prisoners to the castle (mj^ cave), as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and 
that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be 
hanged in chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced them 
that the governor was in earnest: however, they had no way left them but to 
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the cap- 
tain, to persuade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the captain, his 
mate, and passenger; second, then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, 
having their character from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted 
them with arms; third, the other two that I had kept till now in my bower 
pinioned, but, on the captain’s motion, had now released, fourth, these five 
released at last; so that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners 
in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on board 
the ship: but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper for 
us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was employment enough for 
us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals. As to the five in the 
cave, 1 resolved to keep them fast; but Friday went in twice a day to them, 
to supply them with necessaries; and I made the other two carry provisions 
to a certain distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who 
told Jdhem I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 165 

that it was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my 
direction; that S they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid 
in irons; so that, as we never suffered them to see me as governor, I now ap- 
peared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castfe, 
and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difScdlty before him, but to furnish his two boats, 
stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger captain of one, 
with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other; 
and they contrived their business very well, for they came up to the ship about 
midnight. As soon as they came witmn call of the ship, he made Robinson hail 
them, and tell them they had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was 
a long time before they had found them, and the like; holding them in a chat till 
they came to the ship’s side; when the captain and the mate, entering first with 
their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with 
the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men; 
they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began 
to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below; when the other boat 
and their men, entering at the forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, 
and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three men they 
found there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain 
ordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where the 
new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two 
men and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate, with a 
crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among 
them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and 
wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate, calling for help, 
rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, 
shot the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and 
came out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more: 
upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without any 
more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship w^as thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be 
fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his suc- 
cess, which, you may be sure, 1 w^as very glad to hear, having sat watching 
upon the shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning. Having thus heard 
the signal plainly, I laid me dow n, and it having been a day of great fatigue to 
rue, I slept \ery sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun; and pres- 
ently starting up, 1 heard a man call me by the name of “Governor! Gover- 
nor’” and presently 1 knew the captain’s voice; when climbing up to the top 
of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his 
arms. “My dear friend and deliverer,” says he, “there’s your ship; for she is 
all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.” I cast my eyes to the ship, 
and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore, for they 
bad weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather 
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little 
creek; and, the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the 



166 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

place where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was 
at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, 
visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry 
me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time I was not able to 
answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, 
or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and immedi- 
ately pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which 
he had brought on purpose for me. After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the 
ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before 
I could speak a word to him. All this time the poor man was in as great an 
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind 
and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the 
fiood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last it 
broke out into tears; and, in a little while after, I recovered my speech. I then 
took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. 
I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and 
that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as 
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing 
the world, and an evidence that the eye of an infinite pov er could search into 
the remotest corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever He 
pleased. 1 forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what 
heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner 
provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but 
from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed? 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some 
little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches that had 
been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this, he called aloud 
to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the gover- 
nor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been one that was not to be carried 
away with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had 
brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of 
Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good 
tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship’s beef, and six pieces of pork, with a 
bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also brought me a box 
of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, 
and abundance of other things. But besides these, and what was a thousand 
times more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good 
neck-cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stock- 
ings, with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but 
very little: in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind 
and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; 
but never was anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and 
uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were brought 
into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the 
prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we might venture to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 167 

take them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to be 
incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew 
they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry 
them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice 
at the first English colony he could come to; and I found that the captain him- 
self was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I 
would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own 
request that he should leave them upon the island. “I should be very glad of 
that,” says the captain, “with all my heart.” “Well,” says I, “I will send for 
them up, and talk with them for you.” So 1 caused Friday and the two hostages, 
for they were now discharged, their comrades having performed their prom- 
ise, 1 say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the fi\'e men, pinioned 
as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. After some time, 
1 came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called governor again. 
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be brought before 
me, and 1 told them 1 had got a full account of their villainous behavior to the 
captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to 
commit further robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in their own 
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. 
I let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized; that she lay 
now in the road; and they might see by and by, that their new captain had 
received the reward of his villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the 
yard-arm; that, as to them, 1 wanted to know what they had to say why I 
should not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they 
could not doubt but 1 had authority so to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to say 
but this— that when they were taken, the captain promised them their lives, 
and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy 
to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my 
men, and had taken passage with the captain to go for England; and as for the 
captam, he could not cany them to England, other than as prisoners in irons, 
to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship; the consequence of 
which, they must needs know, would be the gallows; so that I could not tell 
what was best for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. 
If they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclinationi 
to give them their lives if they thought they could shift on shore. They seemed 
very thankful for it, and said they would rather venture to stay there than be 
earned to England to be hanged. So I left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he durst not 
leave them there. Upon this, 1 seemed a little angry with the captain, and told 
him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them 
so much favor, 1 would be as good as my word; and that if he did not think 
fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I found them; and if he did 
not like it, he might take them again if he could catch them. Upon this, they 
appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them 
retire into the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave them 



168 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should live 
very well, if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; 
but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired 
him to go on board in the mean time, and keep all right in the ship, and send 
the boat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events, to cause the new 
captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might 
see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apartment, 
and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances. I told 
them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain had carried 
them away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain 
hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing less to 
expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them I 
would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the way 
of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the 
place, and of my coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made 
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a word, all that was 
necessary to make them easy. I told them the story also of the seventeen Span- 
iards that were to be expected, for whom 1 left a letter, and made them prom- 
ise to treat them in common with themselves. Here it may be noted that the 
captain had ink on board, who was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a 
way of making ink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done 
things much more difficult. 

I left them my fire-arms, viz.: five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and three 
swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after the first year 
or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a description of the way 
I managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both 
butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of my own story; and 
told them I should prevail with the capuin to leave them two barrels of gun- 
powder more, and some garden-seeds, which I told them I would have been 
very glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought 
me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done all this, 1 left them the next day, and went on board the ship. 
We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The next 
morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship’s side, and, 
making the most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be taken 
into the ship for God’s sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the cap- 
tain to take them on board, though he hanged them immediately. Upon this, 
the captain pretended to have no power without me; but after some difficulty, 
and after their solemn promise of amendment, they were taken on board, and 
werev *50010 time after, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved 
very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up, with 
the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my intercession, 
caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 169 

tiiankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my power 
to send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of tliis island, I carried on board, for relics, the great 
goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also 1 forgot 
not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long 
useless that it had grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver 
till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as also the money I found in the 
wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as 
I found by the ship’s account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight- 
and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered from this 
second captivity the same day of the month that 1 first made my escape in the 
long-boat, from among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, 
1 arrived in England the i ith of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five 
j ears absent. 

When 1 came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if 
I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I 
had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in 
the world, was become a widow the second time, and very low in the world. 
1 made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give her 
no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former care and faith- 
fulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would afford, which at that time 
would, indeed, allow me to do but little for her: but I assured her I would 
never forget her former kindness to me, nor did I forget her when I had suffi- 
cient to help her, as shall be observed in its proper place. 1 went down after- 
wards into Yorkshire, but my father was dead, and my mother and all the 
family extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of one 
of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had 
been no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve 
or assist me; and that the little money I had would not do much for me as to 
settling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and this 
was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the 
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account 
to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and the 
ship, they invited me to meet them and some other merchants concerned, and 
all together made me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a 
present of almost £200 sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life, and 
how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to 
go to Lisbon, and sec if 1 might not come at some information of the state 
of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who, 
1 had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over for dead. With 
this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following; my 
man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and prov- 
ing a most faithful servant upon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found 
out by inquiry and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


of the ship, who first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa, He was now 
grown old, and had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far from 
a young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man 
did not know me; and, indeed, I hardly knew him. But I soon brought him 
to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when 
I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, 1 in- 
quired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old man 
told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but that he could 
assure me, that when he came away my partner was living; but the trustees, 
whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my part, were both dead: 
that, however, he believed I would have a very good account of the improve- 
ment of the plantation, for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away 
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my part 
of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I 
never came to claim it, one third to the king, and two thirds to the monastery 
of St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the con- 
version of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if 1 appeared, or any one 
for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only that the improve- 
ment, or annual production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be 
restored: but he assured me that the steward of the king’s revenue from lands, 
and the providore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care ail along 
that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful ac- 
count of the produce, of which they had duly received my moiety. I asked 
him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought the plantation, 
and whether he thought it might be worth looking after; or whether, on my 
going thither, I should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just 
right in the moiety. He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the 
plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner was grown ex- 
ceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it, and that, to the best of his 
remembrance, he had heard that the king’s third of my part, which was, it 
seems, granted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted 
to above two hundred moidores a year: that as to my being restored to a 
quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my part- 
ner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the 
register of the country; also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees 
were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not 
only have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very 
considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being the ^produce 
of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as 
above; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and inquired 
of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose 
of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the 
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c. * j a 

He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being dead. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 171 

he could not act as executor, until some certain account should come of my 
death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote: 
that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and could he 
have given any account pf my being dead or alive, he would have acted by 
procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so they called the sugar- 
house), and have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. 
“But,” says the old man, “I have one piece of news to tell you, which perhaps 
may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, believing you were 
lost, and all the world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to 
account with me, in your name, for the first six or eight years’ profits, which 
I received. There being at that time great disbursements for increasing the 
works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so 
much as afterwards it produced: however,” says the old man, “I shall give you 
a true account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.” 

After a few days’ further conference with this ancient friend, he brought 
me an account of the first six years’ income of my plantation, signed by the 
partner and the merchant trustees, being always delivered in goods, viz.: 
tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the 
consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every year 
the income considerably increased; but, as above, the disbursements being large, 
the sum at first was small: however, the old man let me see that he was debtor 
to me four hundred and seventy moidorcs of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, 
and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been 
shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the 
place. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how he 
had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him 
a share in a new ship. “However, my old friend,” says he, “you shall not want 
a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully 
satisfied.” Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me one hundred and 
^ixty Portuguese moidorcs in gold; and giving the writings of his title to the 
ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter-part 
owner, and his son another, he puts them both into my hands for security for 
the rest. 

1 was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be 
able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had taken 
me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and particu- 
larly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping 
at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if his circumstances admitted 
him to spare so much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him. He 
told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little; but, however, jt was 
my money, and I might want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly re- 
frain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the moidorcs, 
and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them: then I returned 
him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the plantation I would 
return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards did); and that as to the 



172 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

bill of sale of his part in his son’s ship, I would not take it by any means; but 
that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I 
did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never 
have a penny more from him. 

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a 
method to make my claim to my plantation. 1 told him I thought to go over to it 
myself. He said I might do so if I pleased; but that, if I did not, there were 
ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to 
my use; and as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away 
to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, 
affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and tliat 1 was the same person who took 
up the land for the planting the said plantation at first. This being regularly 
attested by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, 
with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and 
then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return. 

Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings upon this proc- 
uration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet from the sur- 
vivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in which 
were the following particular letters and papers enclosed. 

First, there was the account current of the produce of my farm or planta- 
tion, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old Portuguese 
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one thousand one hun- 
dred and seventy-four moidores in my favor. 

Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the 
effects in their hands, before the government claimed the administration, as 
being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called civil death; 
and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to 
nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being about three 
thousand two hundred and forty moidores. 

Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine’s account, who had received 
the profits for above fourteen years; but not being to account for what was 
'disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and 
seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my account: 
as to the king’s part, that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner’s, congratulating me very affectionately 
upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved, and 
what it produced, a year; with the particulars of the number of squares or acres 
that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it; and 
making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave 
Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passion- 
ately to come over and take possession of my own; and, in the mean time, to 
give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not come my- 
self; cqncluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; 
and sent me, as a present, seven fine leopards’ skins, which he had, it seems, 
received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and whidi, 
'it seems, had made a better voyage than 1. He sent me also five chests of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 173 

excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so 
large as moidores. By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees shipped me 
one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and 
the rest of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than the 
beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my very heart when 
I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the 
same ships which brought my letters brought my goods: and the effects were 
safe in the river before the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, 
and grew sick; and, had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, 
I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon 
the spot: nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till a 
physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of my illness being 
known, he ordered me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well: 
but 1 verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to 
the spirits, I should have died. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds sterling in 
money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thou- 
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England: and, in a word, 
1 was in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to com- 
pose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing I did was to recompense 
my original benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable 
to me in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end. 
I showed him all that was sent to me; I told him, that next to the providence 
of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now 
lay on me to reward him, which 1 would do a hundred-fold: so I first returned 
to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then 1 sent for a notary, 
and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the four 
hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in 
the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which, I caused a procuration 
to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of the annual profits of my 
plantation; and appointing my partner to account with him, and make the 
returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a clause in the end, 
made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him during his life, out of 
the effects, and fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life; and thus 
1 requited my old man. 

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next and what to do 
with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and indeed, I had 
more care upon my head now than I had in my silent state of life in the island, 
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted; 
whereas 1 had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how to secure 
It. I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might lie 
without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would 
meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust 
^ith it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only 
refuge I had. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon 



174 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had 
settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At first 
I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be 
just to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, 
might be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to England 
myself, and take my effects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and therefore, as 
I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my 
former benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose husband had 
been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful 
steward and instructor. So, the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to 
write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find 
her out, and carry her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with 
her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have 
a further supply: at the same time, I sent my two sisters in the country a 
hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet not in very good 
circumstances; one having been married and left a widow; and the other having 
a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But, among all my relations or 
acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the 
gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe 
behind me; and this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled myself there, 
for I was, as it were, naturalized to the place; but I had some little scruple in 
my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me back. However, it was not 
religion that kept me from going there for the present; and as I had made no 
scruple of being openly of the religion of the country all the while I was 
among them, so neither did I yet; only that, now and then, having of late 
thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of living and dying 
among them, I began to regret my having professed myself a Papist, and 
thought it might not be the best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going to 
the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects 
behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if I arrived, I con- 
cluded 1 should make some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be 
faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to go to England with all my 
wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet being 
just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful 
account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the Prior of St. Augustine 
I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of th6 eight 
hundred and seventy-two moidorcs which were undisposed of, which 1 desired 
might be given, five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct; desiring the good padre’s 
prayers for me, and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, 
widi all the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as 
for sending them any present, they were far above having any occasion for it. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 175 

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowled^ng his industry in the improving 
the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of the works; giving 
him instructions for his future government of my part, according to the 
powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever 
became due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly; assuring him 
that it was my intention not only to come to him, but to settle myself there 
for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very handsome present of 
some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters (for such the captain’s son 
informed me he had), with two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I 
could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a 
good value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my effects into 
good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go to England: 

1 had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to 
go to England by sea at that time; and though 1 could give no reason for it, 
yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though I had once shipped 
my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but two 
or three times. 

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of the 
reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases 
of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean 
more particularly singled out than any other, having put my things on board 
one of them, and in the other having agreed with the captain; I say two of 
these ships miscarried; viz.: one was taken by the Algerines, and the other 
was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned, except 
three, so that in either of those vessels 1 had been made miserable. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I com- 
municated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but either to 
go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from 
whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais 
and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land through France. 
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except from 
Calais to Dover, that 1 resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was 
not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: 
and to make it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son 
of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me: after which we 
picked up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese 
gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that in all, there were six of us, 
and five servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting them- 
selves with one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got 
an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who 
was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on 
the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well 
mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the honor 



1^6 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had 
aetvants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trpuble you 
now with none of my land journal; but some adventures that happened to \is in 
this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were 
willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth 
observing; but, it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and 
set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we came to the 
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an 
account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of the mountains, 
that several travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having 
attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed, and to me, that 
had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could scarce 
bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed, was it more painful 
than surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the 
weather was not only warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind 
from the Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intoler- 
able, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered 
with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in 
his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued 
snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people said winter was 
come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were now 
quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us 
to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, 
there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every step. 
We staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna, when (seeing the winter 
coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter 
all over Europe that had been known in the memory of man), I proposed that 
we should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which 
was a very little voyage. But, while I was considering this, there came in four 
French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the passes, 
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the country 
near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains by such 
ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow; for where they 
met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear 
them and their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake 
to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were 
armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in these 
great snows, it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot 
of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being 
covered with snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such 
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, 
ivhich, we arc told, we were in most danger from, especially on the French 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 177 

ride of the mountams. He satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind in 
the way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also 
twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, 
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back agam. 

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide, on the 15th of 
November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he 
came directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid, 
about twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain 
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was 
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he 
approached the mountains another way; and though it is true the hills and 
precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led 
^ us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the mountains 
without being much encumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden, he 
showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all 
green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a great distance, and we had some 
rough way to pass still. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day 
and a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bade us be easy; we should 
soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and 
to come more north than before; and so, depending upon our guide, we 
went on. 

If was about two hours before night, when, our guide being something 
before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after 
them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood: two of the wolves 
made at the guide, and, had he been far before us, he would have been de- 
voured before we could have helped him; one of them fastened upon his horse, 
and the other attacked the man with such violence, that he had not time or 
presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us 
most lustily. My man Friday being next me, T bade him ride up, and see what 
was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out 
as loud as the other, “O master! O master!'’ but like a bold fellow, rode 
directly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him 
in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having been 
used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but went 
close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would have fired at a 
farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered 
shooting the man. 

But It was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it 
alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday’s pistol, we heard 
on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by 
the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious 
number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few as that we had no 
cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that 
had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and fled, without doing 



178 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


him any damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of 
the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging 
creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above 
his knee; and though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down 
by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday’s pistol we all mended our 

f >ace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult, would give us 
eave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which 
blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had 
disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of 
creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardly, and in such a surprising manner, 
as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all, though 
at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable. 
As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, 
who is swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, which generally are 
the rule of his actions: first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does 
not usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively 
hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being covered 
with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but 
then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he 
is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, 
if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another way and keep going 
on, for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he 
takes it for an affront: but if you throw or toss anything at him, and it hits 
him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself 
abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have 
satisfaction in point of honor;— that is his first quality: the next is, if he be once 
affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but 
follows at a good round rate till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him, he 
was Helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, when 
on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood, and a monstrous one it 
was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised when we 
saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the 
fellow’s countenance. “O, O, O!” says Friday, three times, pointing to him; 
“O master! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him; me makee you 
good laugh.” 

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. **You fool,” says I, “he will 
cat you up.” “Eatee me up! eatee me up!” says Friday, twice over again; “me 
eatee him up; me makee you good laugh; you all stay here, me show you good 
laugh.” So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a moment, and puts on a pair 
of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket), 
gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like 
the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


179 


Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand him, 
*‘Hark ye, hark ye,” says Friday, “me speakee with you,” We followed at a 
distance, for now being come down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we 
were entered a vast forest, where the country was plain and pretty open, 
though it had many trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we 
say, the heels of the bear, come up with him quickly, and took up a great stone, 
and threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm 
than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday’s end, for the 
rogue was so void of tear that he did it purely to make the^bear follow him, 
and show us some laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and 
saw him, he turns about, and comes after him, taking very long strides, and 
shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling 
gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for 
help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man; 
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back ujx)n us, when 
he was going about his own business another way; and especially 1 was angry 
that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run away; and I called out, “You 
dog’ is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we 
may shoot the creature.” lie heard me, and cried out, “No shoot, no shoot; 
stand still, and you get much laugh:” and as the nimble creature ran two feet 
for the bear’s one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great 
oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, 
he got ninitly up the tree, and laying his gun down upon the ground, at about 
five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree, 
and we followed at a distance; the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, 
smelled at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a 
cat, though so monstrous heavy. 1 was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of 
my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till seeing the 
bear get up the tree, wc all rode near to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of a 
large branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the bear got 
out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker,— “Ha!” says he to us, 
“now you see me teachee the bear dance:” so he began jumping and shaking 
the bough, at v^hich the bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to look 
behind him, to see h&w he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. 
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, 
he called out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, 
“What, you come no farther? pray you come farther;” so he left jumping and 
shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come 
a little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We 
thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and called to Friday 
to stand still, and we would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly, “O 
pray! O pray! no shoot; me shoot by and then:” he would have said by and 
by. However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood 
so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what 
the fellow would do; for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear 



180 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

off; and we found the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go 
out far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws 
and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what 
the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of our doubt quickly: for 
seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded 
to come any farther, “Well, well,” says Friday, “you no come farther, me go; 
you no come to me, me come to you;” and upon this he went out to the 
smaller end of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently let 
himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to jump 
down on his feet; and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still. 
“Well,” said 1 to him, “Friday, what will you do now? Why don’t you shoot 
him?” “No shoot,” sajs Friday, “no yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, 
give you one more laugh:” and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear saw his 
enemy gone, he came back from the bough where he stood, but did it very 
cautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into 
the body of the tree; then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down 
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very 
leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot on the 
ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into 
his car, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not 
laugh; and when he saw wc were pleased, by our looks, he began to laugh 
very loud. “So we kill bear in my country,” says Friday. “So you kill them?” 
says I; “why, you have no guns.” “No,” says he, “no gun, but shoot great 
much long arrow.” This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a 
wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do wc hardly knew; 
the howling of wolves ran much in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I 
once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I 
never heard anytliing that filled me with so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as Friday 
would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous 
creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and 
our guide hastened us: so we left him, and went forward on our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous 
as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were 
come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for 
food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they 
surprised the country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and 
some people too. We had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us, 
if there were more wolves in the country we should find them there;^and this 
was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a long narrow 
defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then we 
should come to the village where we were to lodge. It was within half an hour 
of sunset when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when we came 
into the plain: we met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little 
]f>Iain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five 
great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 181 

in chase of some prey, and had it in view; thev took no notice of us, and were 
gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon this, our guide who, by the way, 
was but a faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready posture, for he be- 
lieved there were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and our 
eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, 
which was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into 
the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us: the first object we met 
with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had 
killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating him, but 
picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. We did not 
think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did they take much notice of us. 

^ Friday would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; 

' for 1 found wc were like to have more business upon our hands than we were 
^ware of. We had not gone half over the plain, when we began to hear the 
evolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after 
v/e saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and 
most of them in a Imc, as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced 
officers. 1 scarce knew in what manner to receive them, but found to draw our- 
selves in a close line w'as the only way; so we formed in a moment; but that 
wc might not have too much interval, I ordered that only every other man 
should fire, and that the others, who had not fired, should stand ready to give 
them a second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and 
then that those who had fired at first, should not pretend to load their fusees 
again, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for wc w ere all armed with a 
fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method, able to fire 
sit volleys, half of us at a time: however, at present we had no necessity; for 
upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well 
with the noise as with the fire. Four of them, being shot in the head, dropped; 
several others were wounded, and went bleeding off, as wc could see by the 
snow. I found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, 
remembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at 
the voice of a man, 1 caused all the company to halloo as loud as we could; and 
1 found the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they began to 
retire and turn about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, 
V/hich put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. This gave us 
leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept 
going, but we had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves m 
readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only 
that It was farther onward, the same way we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the hght began to be dusky, which made it 
worse on our side, but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was 
the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, we per- 
ceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one 
in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them: however, as they 
did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make our 
horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a good hard trot. In this 



182 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

manner, we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through which we were 
to pass, at the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when 
coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing 
just at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard 
the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and 
a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him 
full q^eed: the horse had the advantage of them; but as we supposed that he 
couldf not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him 
at last: no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight: for, riding up to the entrance where 
the horse came out, we found the carcases of another horse and of two men, 
devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no doubt the 
same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; 
but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body were eaten up. This 
filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to take; but the creatures 
resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I 
verily believe there were three hundred of them. It happened, very much to 
our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, 
there lay some large timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer 
before, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among 
those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them 
all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a 
triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre. We did so, and it 
was well we did; for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made 
upon us in this place. They came on with a growling kind of noise, and 
mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, w^is our breastwork, as if they 
were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was 
principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men 
to fire as before, every other man, and they took their aim so sure that they 
killed several of the wolves at the first volley, but there was a necessity to 
keep a continued firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing 
on those before. 

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they stopped 
a little, and I hoped they would ha\e gone off, but it was but a moment, for 
others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I 
believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and 
lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath to spend our shot 
too hastily, so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better 
employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee 
and his own while we were engaged,--but, as I said, 1 called my other man, and 
giving him a horn of powder, 1 bade him lay a train all along the piece of 
timber, and let it be a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get away, 
when the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an 
uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the 
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped 
in among us with the force and fright of the fire: we despatched these in an 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 183 

instant, and the rest were so frightened with the light, which the night— for it 
was now very dark— made more terrible, that they drew back a little; upon 
which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we 
gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon 
near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to 
cutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the crying 
and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so that they 
all fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it been day- 
light we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we made 
forward again, for we had still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous 
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times, and sometimes 
we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not 
certain. In about an hour more we came to the town where wc were to lodge, 
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms, for, it seems, the night 
before, the wolves and some bears had broke into the village, and put them in 
such terror, and they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially 
in the night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much with 
the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were 
obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a warm 
climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything 
like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing 
but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, espe- 
cially when the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much what kind of 
a guide wc had got, who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe 
season, and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured. When we told 
them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us 
exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but wc had been all destroyed, for 
it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their 
prey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun, —but being exces- 
sively hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses 
had made them senseless of danger,— and that if wc had not by the continued 
fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had 
been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been 
content to have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not 
have taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, 
as otherwise; and, withal, they told us that at last, if we had stood all together, 
and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that 
we might have come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and 
being so many in number. For my part, 1 was never so sensible of danger in my 
life,— for, seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to 
devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, 1 gave myself over for 
lost; and, as it w^as, I believe 1 shall never care to cross those mountains again; 
I think 1 would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to 
meet with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through France, 
nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with much more 
advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any 
considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14 th of January, 
after having a severe cold season to travel in. ’ 

1 was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time all my 
new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which 1 brought with 
me having been very currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who, 
in grautude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much nor care 
too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with everything, 
that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I was very 
happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of 
this good gentlewoman. 

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I wrote 
to my old friend at Lisbon, who having offered it to the two merchants, the 
survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the offer, and 
remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at 
Lisbon to pay for it. 

In return, 1 signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent from 
Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for thirty- 
two thousand eight hundred pieces-of-cight for the estate, reserving the pay- 
ment of one hundred moidorcs a year to him (the old man) during his life, 
and fifty* moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which 1 promised them, 
and which the plantation was to make good as a rent-charge. And thus 1 have 
given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure,~a life of Providence’s 
checker-work, and of a variety w hich the world will seldom be able to show the 
like of;— beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of 
it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for. 

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I was 
past running any more hazards,— and so, indeed, 1 had been, if other circum- 
stances had concurred, but 1 was inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor 
many relations; nor, however rich, had 1 contracted much acquaintance; and 
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that country 
out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the wdng again; especially I 
could not resist the strong inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the 
poor Spaniards were in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dis- 
suaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years 
she prevented my running abroad, during which time 1 took my two nephews, 
the children of one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having something 
of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition 
to his estate after my decease. The other 1 placed with the captain of a ship, 
and after five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, 
I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow after- 
wards drew me in, as old as I was, to further adventures myself. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I marriei 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 185 

and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three chil- 
dren, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming 
home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, 
and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship as a private 
trader to the East Indies; that was in the year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island,— saw my successors the 
Spaniards, -had the whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left there,— 
how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, -how they afterwards agreed, 
disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use 
violence with them,— how they were subjected to the Spaniards,— how honestly 
the Spaniards used them; a history, if it were entered into, as full of variety and 
wonderful accidents as my own part,— particularly, also, as to their battles with 
the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the improve- 
ment they made upon the island itself,— and how five of them made an attempt 
upon the main land, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, 
by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children on the island. 

Here I staid about twenty days,— left them supplies of all necessary things, 
and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which 
I brouglit from England with me,— viz.: a carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to myself the 
property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed on; 
and having settled all things with them, and engaged them not to leave the place, 
I left them there, 

troin thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which I 
brought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides other supplies, 
I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for service, or for wives to 
such as would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them 
some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would 
apply themselves to planting,— which I afterwards could not perform. The fel- 
lows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered, and had their 
propcities set apart for them. I sent them also from the Brazils, five cows, three 
of them being big wdth calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came 
again were considerably increased. 

But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came and 
invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with that 
whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but, 
at last, a storm destroying their enemies’ canoes, they famished or destroyed 
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation, 
and still lived upon ilie island. 

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new adventures 
of mv own, for ten years more, 1 shall give a further account of in the second 
part of niy history. 




THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 




THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 


That homely proverb, used on so many occasions in England, viz.: “That what 
is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh,” was never more verified than in 
the story of my life. Any one would think that after thirty-five years’ affic- 
tion, and a variety of unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever 
went through before, and after seven years of peace and enjoyment in the ful- 
ness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have 
had experience of every state of middle life, and to know which was most 
adapted to make a man completely happy; I say, after all this, any one would 
have thought that the native propensity to rambling, which 1 gave an account 
of in my first setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my 
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be fully evacuated, or at least 
condensed, and I might, at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to 
stay at home, and have done venturing life and fortune any more. 

Nay, further, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away in 
me, for 1 had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek; if 1 had gained ten 
thousand pounds, 1 had been no richer; for I had already sufficient for me, and 
for those I had to leave it to; and what I had was visibly increasing; for, having 
no great family, 1 could not spend the income of what 1 had, unless 1 would set 
up for an expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, 
gayct) , and the like, which were things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so 
that I had nothing, indeed, to do, but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, 
and see it increase daily upon my hands. Yet all these things had no effect upon 
me, or at least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad 
again, which hung about me like a chronical distemper. In particular, the desire 
of seeing my new plantatitin in the island, and the colony I left there, ran in 
my head continually. 1 dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran upon it 
ail day; it was uppermost in all my thoughts; and my fancy worked so steadily 
and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could re- 
move It out of my mind: it even broke so violently into all my discourses that it 
made my conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else; all my dis- 
course ran into it, even to impertinence; and 1 saw it myself. 

1 have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the stir people 
make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing to the strength of 
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds; that there is 
no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking; that people’s poring 
affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased friends, so realizes it 
to them, that they are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary circum- 
i*tances, that they sec them, talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in 
truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapor in the thing, and they really know 
nothing of the matter. 

I'or my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any such things as 

189

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


Xtal a;pparitions, spectres, or walking of people after they are dead; or whether 
diere is anything in the stories they tell us of that kind more than the product 
of vapors, sick minds, and wandering fancies: but this I know, that my imagina- 
tion worked up to such a height, and brought me into such excess of vapors, or 
what else I may call it, that 1 actually supposed myself often upon the spot, at 
my old castle, behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday’s father, and the 
reprobate sailors 1 left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and 
looked at them steadily, though 1 was broad awake, as at persons just before me; 
and this I did till 1 often frightened myself with the images my fancy repre-* 
sented to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of the three pirate saUors 
so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday’s father, that it was sur- 
prising: they told me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the Span- 
iards, and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to 
distress and starve them; things that 1 had never heard of, and that, indeed, 
were never all of them true in fact: but it was so warm in my imagination, and 
so realized to me, that, to the hour 1 saw them, I could not be persuaded bur 
that it was, or would be, true: also how 1 resented it, when the Spaniard com- 
plained to me; and how T brought them to justice, tried them, and ordered them 
all three to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be seen in its place: 
for however 1 came to form such things in my dream, and what secret converse 
of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, much of it, true. 1 own that this dream 
had nothing in it literally and specifically true; but the general part was so true, 
—the base, villainous behavior of these hardened rogues was such, and had been 
so much worse than all 1 can describe, that the dream had too much similitude 


of the fact; and as I would afterwards have punished them severely, so, if 1 had 
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and even should have been jus- 
tified both by the laws of God and man. But to return to my story: In this land 
of temper I lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, 
no agreeable diversion, but what had something or other of this in it; so that 
my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously one 
night, that she believed there was some secret, powerful impulse of Providence 
upon me, which had determined me to go thither again; and that she found 
nothing hindered my going, but my being engaged to a wife and children. She 
told me that it was true she could not think of parting with me: but as she was 
assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing I would do; so, as it 
seemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would not be the only 


obstruction; for, if I thought fit and resolved to go — [Here she found me very 
intent upon her words, and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it a little 
disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go cto, and say 
out what she was going to say? But I perceived that her heart was too full, and 
some tears stood in her eyes.] “Speak out, my dear,” said 1; “are you willing 
I should go?” “No,” says she, very affectionately, “I am far from willing; but 
if you are resolved to go,” says she, “rather than 1 would be the only hinderance, 
I will go with you: for though I think it a most preposterous thing for one of 
your years, and in your condition, yet, if it must be,” said she, again weeping, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE m 

would not leave you; for, if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting 
if and if Heaven make it your duty to go. He will also make it mine to go wim 
you, or otherwise dispose of me, rfiat 1 may not obstruct it.” 

^ This affectionate behavior of my wife’s brought me a little out of the vapors, 
and I began to consider what I was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, 
and began to argue with myself sedately what business I had after threescore 
years, and after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so 
happy and easy a manner,—! say, what business had I to rush into new hazards, 
and put myself upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run into? 

With these thoughts 1 considered my new engagement; that 1 had a wife, 
one child born, and my wife then great with child of another; that I had all the 
world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain, that I was de- 
clining in years, and ought to think rather of leaving what 1 had gained than of 
seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had said of its being an impulse 
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of that; 
so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of my 
imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people may always do in like 
cases if they will; and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with such 
arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my present condition 
furnished me plentifully with; and particularly, as the most effectual method, I 
resolved to divert myself with other things, and to engage in some business 
that might effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I 
found that thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to 
do, nor anything of moment immediately before me. To this purpose, I bought 
a little farm in the county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I 
had a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it, 1 found, was capable 
of great improvement; and it was many ways suited to my inclination, which 
delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land; and par- 
ticularly, being an inland country, I was removed from conversing among 
sailors, and things relating to the remote parts of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought ploughs, har- 
rows, a cart, wagon, horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously to work, 
became in one half year a mere country gentleman: my thoughts were entirely 
taken up in managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, 
&c., and I lived, as 1 thought, the most agreeable life that nature was capable of 
directing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating to. 

1 farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited by no articles; 
I could pull up or cut down as I pleased: what I planted was for myself, and 
v^hat 1 improved was for my family; and having thus left off the thoughts of 
wandering, I had not the least discomfort in any pait of life as to this world. 
Now 1 thought indeed that 1 enjoyed the middle state of life, which my father 
so earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, something 
like what is described by the poet, upon the subject of a country life:— 


“Free from vices, free from care, 
Age has no pain, and youth no snareP 



192 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Providence uu 
hinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon me inevitable and in 
curable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the wandering 
disposition, which, as 1 may say, being bom in my very blood, soon recoverec 
its hold of me; and like the returns of a violent distemper, came on with ar 
irresistible force upon me. This blow was the loss of my wife. It is not my busi 
ness here to write an elegy upon my wife, give a character of her pardculai 
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She 
was, in a few words, the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, 
the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I was in, 
from the most extravagant and ruinous projects that filled my head, and did 
more to guide my rambling genius than a mother’s tears, a father’s instruction, 
a friend’s counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. I was happy in 
listening to her, and in being moved by her entreaties; and to the last degree 
desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. I was as much a 
stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Brazils, when I first went on shore 
there; and as much alone, except for the assistance of servants, as I was in my 
island. I knew neither what to think nor what to do. 1 saw the world busy 
around me; one part laboring for bread, another part squandering in vile ex- 
cesses, or empty pleasures, equally miserable, because the end they proposed still 
fled from them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeitcci of their vice, and 
heaped up work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of labor spent their 
strength in daily struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they labored 
with; so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and working 
but to live, as if daily bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a weari- 
some life the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island; where I 
suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred no more 
-goats, because I had no more use for them; where the money lay in the drawer 
till it grew mouldy, and had scarce the favor to be looked upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have done, and as reason 
and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to search farther than 
human enjoyments for a full felicity; and that there was something which cer- 
tainly was the reason and end of life, superior to all these things, and which was 
cither to be possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone: I was like a ship without a pilot, that could 
only run afore the wind. My thoughts ran all away again into the old affair; my 
head was quite turned with the whimseys of foreign adventures; and all the 
pleasant, innocent amusements of my farm, my garden, myr catde, and my 
family, which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish 
and were like music to one that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste: m a 
word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London; 
and in a few months after I did so. 

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I had no relish 
for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 193 

idle person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in God’s creation, 
and it is not one farthing^s matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or 
alive. This also was the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the most 
my aversion, who had been all my days used to an active life; and I would often 
say to myself, “A state of idleness is the very dregs of life;” and, indeed, I 
thought 1 was much more suitably employed when 1 was twenty-six days mak- 
ing a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom, as I have 
observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and had made him commander 
of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had 
made. He came to me, and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance 
had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and to 
China, as private traders. “And now, uncle,” says he, “if you will go to sea with 
me, I v^ill engage to land you upon your old habitation in the island; for we are 
to touch at the Brazils.” 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of the existence 
of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of 
things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated 
to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was re- 
turned upon me, and 1 knew nothing of what he had in his thought to say, 
when that very morning, before he came to me, 1 had, in a great deal of con- 
fusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circumstances in my mind, 
come to this resolution, that 1 would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old 
sca-captain; and if it was rational and practicable, 1 would go and see the island 
again, and what was become of my people there. I had pleased myself with the 
thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a 
patent for the possession, and 1 know not what: when, in the middle of all this, 
in conics my nephew, as 1 have said, with his project of carrying me thither in 
his way to the East Indies. 

1 paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily at him, “What devil,” said 
I, “sent you on this unlucky errand?” My nephew stared as if he had been fright- 
ened, at first; but perceiving that I was not much displeased with the proposal, 
he recovered himself. “I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir,” says he; 
“1 dare say you would be pleased to see your new colony there, where you once 
reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the world.” 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to say, the pre- 
possession I was under, and of which I have said so much, that I told him, in a 
few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I would go with him; but I told 
him I would not promise to go any farther than my own island. “Why, sir,” 
Mys he, “you don’t want to be left there again I hope?” “Why,” said I, “can 
you not take me up again on your return?” He told me it would not be possible 
to do so; that the merchants would never allow him to come that way with a 
hden ship of such value, it being a month’s sail out of his way, and might be 
three or four. “Besides, sir, if I should miscarry,” said he, “and not return at all,, 
then you would be just reduced to the condition you were in before.” 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it; which was tt 
carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which being taken in pieces, and shippec 
on board the ship, might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we a|;reed t( 
carry with us, be set up agam in the island, and finished fit to go to sea in a fev 
days. 

I was not long resolving; for, indeed, the importunities of my nephew joinec 
so effectually with my inclination, that nothing could oppose me; on the othei 
hand, my wife being dead, nobody concerned themselves so much for me as tc 
persuade me to one way or the other, except my ancient good friend th( 
widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years, my easy cir- 
cumstances, and the needless hazards of a long voyage; and above all, my younj 
children. But it was all to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire for the voyage 
and I told her I thought there was somethmg so uncommon in the impression' 
I had upon my mind, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if 1 shoulc 
attempt to stay at home; after which she ceased her expostulations, and joinec 
with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in settling ni) 
family affairs for my absence, and providing for the education of my children 

In order to do this, I made my wdl, and settled the estate I had in such a man- 
ner for my children, and placed in such hands, tliat 1 was perfectly easy anc 
satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever might befall me; anc 
for their education, I left it wholly to the widow, with a sufficient maintenance 
to herself for her care; all which she richly deserved; for no mother coulc 
have taken more care in their education, or understood it better; and as sh( 
lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 1694-5; 

I, with my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, the Bth; having, besidei 
tiiat sloop, which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of all kinds 01 
necessary things for my colony; which if I did not find in good condition, I re 
solved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I proposed to place there as in 
habitants, or at least to set on work there, upon my account, while I staid, anc 
either to leave them there or carry them forward, as they should appear willing 
particularly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fel 
low, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic; for he wa 
dexterous at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was a good turnei 
and a good pot-maker; he also made anything that was proper to make of eartl 
or of wood; in a word, we called him our Jack-of-all-trades. With these I car 
tied a tailor, who had offered himself to go a passenger to the East Indies wit! 
my nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation; and wh 
proved a most necessary, handy fellow, as could be desired in many other busi 
nesses besides that of his trade; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms u 
for all employments. 

1 My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept account of the par 
tabilars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and some English thin stuff! 
for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there; and enough of 
as. bv mv calculation, might comfortably supply them for seven years; if 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 195 

remember right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with gloves, hats, 
shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could want for wearing, amounted 
to above two hundred pounds, including some beds, bedding, and household 
stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &a, and 
near a hundred pounds more in iron work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, 
hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees; besides some pistols, 
a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two 
pieces of brass cannon; and, because I knew not what time and what extremities 
1 was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cut- 
lasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberds; so that, in short, we had a 
large magazine of all sorts of stores; and I made my nephew carry two small 
I quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there 
^was occasion; that when we came there, we might build a fort, and man it 
[against all sorts of enemies: and, indeed, I at first thought there would be need 
'enough for all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the 
l^island; as shall be seen in the course of that story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet with; and, 

' therefore, shall have less occasion to interrupt the reader, who, perhaps, may be 
I impatient to hear how matters went with my colony: yet some old accidents, 

[ cross winds, and bad weather happened on this first setting out, which made 
[ the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and 1 , who had never made but one 
voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to come back 
{'.gain, as the voyage was at first designed, began to think the same ill fate at- 
tended me; and that I was born to be never contented with being on shore, and 
yet to be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were obliged to put in 
at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two-and-twenty days; but we 
had this satisfaction with the disaster, that provisions were here exceeding 
cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that while we lay here, we never touched the 
ship’s stores, but rather added to them. Here, also, 1 took in several live hogs, 
and tv'o cows with their calves, which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put 
on shore in my Island: but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them. 

Wc set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very fair gale of wind 
for some days. As I remember, it might be about the 20th of February, in the 
evening late, when the mate, having the watch, came into the round-house and 
} told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us 
of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another. This made us all 
run out upon the quarter-deck, where, for awhile, we heard nothing; but in a 
few minutes we saw a very great light, and found that there was some very 
terrible fire at a distance; immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in 
which we all agreed that there could be no land that way in which the fire 
showed itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W. 
Upon this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our 
hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could not be far off. 
We stood directly towards it, and were presently satisfied we should discover it, 



196 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

because the farther we sailed, the greater the light appeared; though, the weath 
being hazy, we could not perceive anything but the light for awhile* In aboi 
half an hour’s saiUng, the wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and tl 
weather clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a great ship c 
fire, in the middle of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with the disaster, though not at all acquainte 
with the persons engaged in it; I presently recollected my former circumstance 
and what condition I was in when taken up by the Portuguese captain, and ho^ 
much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging t 
that ship must be, if they had no other ship in company with them. Upon thi 
I immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon after anothej 
that, if possible, we might give notice to them that there was help for them j 
hand, and that they might endeavor to save themselves in their boat; for thoug 
we could see the flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothin 
of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship drove, waii 
ing for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had reaso 
to expect it, the ship blew up m the air, and immediately, that is to say, in a fei 
minutes, all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This m 
a terrible, and, indeed, an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, 
concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distres 
in their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which, at present, as it was dark, 
could not see. However, to direct them as well as 1 could, I caused lights to b 
hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could, and which we had lantern 
for, and kept firing guns all night long; letting them know by this that there wa 
a ship not far off. 

About eight o’clock in the morning, we discovered the ship’s boats by help o 
our perspective-glasses, and found there were two of them, both thronged wid 
people, and deep in the water. We perceived they rowed, the wind beinj 
against them; and they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, and hunj 
a waft out, as a signal for them to come on board; and then made more sail 
standing directly to them. In little more than half an hour, we came up wid 
them; and, in a word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men 
women, and children; for there were a great many passengers. 

Upon inquiry, we found it was a French merchant ship of three hundrec 
tons, home bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master gave us < 
long account of the distress of his ship; how the fire began in the steerage, b) 
the negligence of the steersman, but, on his crying out for help, was, as ever) 
body thought, entirely put out; but they soon found that some' sparks of thi 
first fire had got into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that the] 
could not effectually quench it; and afterwards getting in between the timbers 
and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and mastered ai 
the skill and all the application they were able to exert. 

'They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which, to thei 
great comfort, were pretty large; being dieir long-boat, and a great shallop 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 19 ? 

befdd^ a*small skiff, which was of no great service to them, other than to get 
some fresh water and provisions into her, after they had secured their lives from 
the fire. They had, indeed, small hope of their lives by getting into these boats, 
at that distance from any land; only, as they said, that they thus escaped from 
the hre, and there was a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea, 
and might take them in. They had sails, oars, and a compass; and were preparing 
to make the best of their way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty 
fair, for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They had as much provision and 
water as, with sparing it, so as to be next door to starving, might support them 
about twelve days, in which, if they had no bad weather and no contrary wkids, 
the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks of Newfoundland, and 
might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they might go on shore. But 
there were so many chances against them in all these cases, such as storms, 
to overset and founder them; rains and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs; 
contrary winds, to keep them out and starve them; that it must have been next 
to miraculous if they had escaped. 

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and ready to 
despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they were on a sudden sur- 
prised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four more: these were 
the five guns which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This revived 
their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, I desired it should, that 
there was a ship at hand for their help. It was upon the hearing of these guns 
that they took down their masts and sails: the sound coming j^om the wind- 
ward, they resolved to lie by till morning. Some time after this, hearing no 
more guns, they fired three muskets, one a considerable while after another; but 
these, the wind being contrary, wc never heard. 

Some time after that again, they were still more agreeably surprised with see- 
ing our lights, and hearing the guns which, as I have said, I caused to be fired 
all the rest of the night. This set them to work wuth their oars, to keep their 
boats ahead, at least, that wc might the sooner come up with them; and, at last, 
to their inexpressible joy, they found wc saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the .several gestures, the strange ecstasies, 
the variety of postures, which these poor delivered people ran into, to express 
the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily 
described, sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and hands, 
make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a 
thousand extravagances in it. There were some in rears; some raging and tear- 
ing thernsehes, as if they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some 
stark raving and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with 
their feet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing, some singing, some 
laughing, more crying, many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others sick 
and vomiting; several swooning and ready to faint; and a few were crossii^ 
themselves, and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them either; there might be many that were thankful 
afterwards; but the passion was too strong for them at first, and they were not 



m WORKS OF DANtEL DEFOE 

abl^ to master it; they were thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy, and it 
was but a very few that were composed and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from tne particular cir- 
cumstances of that nation they belonged to; I mean the French, whose temper 
is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly, and their 
spirits more fluid than in other nations. 1 am not philosopher enough to deter- 
mine the cause; but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it. The ecstasies 
poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found his father in the boat, 
came the nearest to it; and the surprise of the master and his two companions, 
whom I delivered from the villains and set them on shore in the island, came a 
little way towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw in 
Friday, or anywhere else in my life. 

It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show themselves in 
that different manner I have mentioned, in different persons only; but all the 
variety would appear, in a short succession of moments, in one and the same 
person. A man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and con- 
founded, would the next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic; and the 
next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping 
them under his feet like a madman; in a few moments after that we would nave 
him all in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not immediate help been had, he 
would in a few moments have been dead; and thus it was, not with one or two, 
or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them; and, if I remember right, 
our surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty of them. 

There were two priests among them; one an old man, and the other a young 
man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the worst. As soon 
as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself safe, he dropped down 
stone dead to all appearance; not the least sign of life could be perceived in 
him: our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to recover him, and was 
the only man in the ship that believed he was not dead. At length he opened a 
vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as 
much as possible. Upon this, the blood, which only dropped at first, flowing 
freely, in three minutes after the man opened his eyes; and a quarter of an hour 
after he spoke, grew better, and in a little time quite well. After the blood was 
stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfeedy well, took a dram of cordial 
which the surgeon gave him, and had come to himself. About a quarter of an 
hour after this, they came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleed- 
oiqg a French woman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark 
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his 
mind, and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy. His spirits whirled about 
faster than the vessels could convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish; 
and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it. The sur- 
geon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him something t6 
doze and put him to sleep; which, after some time, operated upon him, ana he 
awoke next morning perfeedy composed and well. 

The younger priest behaved with great command of his passions, and was 
really an example of a serious, well-governed mind. At his first coming on 

f 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 199 

board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating himself in thanks 
fulness for his deliverance, in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed 
him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but he spoke calmly, thanked me, 
told me he was giving God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave him 
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also. 

I w’as heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left him, but kept 
others from interrupting him also. He continued in that posture about three 
minutes, or little more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had said he 
would, and, with a great deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his 
eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him and so many miserable crea- 
tures their lives. I told him I had no need to tell him to thank God for it, 
rather than me, for I had seen that he had done that already; but I added that it 
was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men, and that we had 
as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had blessed us so far as to 
make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures. 

After this, the young priest applied himself to his countrymen; labored to 
compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his 
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason; and with some he had 
success, though, others were for a time out of all government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be useful to those 
into whose hands it may fall, for guiding themselves in the extravagances of 
their passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond 
the reach of their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and a 
provoked mind, carry us to? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an ex- 
ceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfac- 
tion, as those of sorrow and anger. 

We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among our new 
guests, for the first day; but after they had retired to lodgings provided for 
them as well as our ship would allow, and they had slept heartily— as most of 
them did, being fatigued and frightened— they were quite another sort of people 
the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kindness shown 
them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough to exceed 
that way. The captain and one of the priests came to me the next day, and de- 
sired to speak with me and my nephew; the commander began to consult with 
us what should be done with them; and, first, told us we had saved their lives; 
so all they had was little enough for a return to us for that kindness received. 
The captain said they had saved some money and some things of value in their 
boats, caught hastily out of the flames, and if we would accept it, they were 
ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only desired to be set on shore 
somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might get a passage to Francet 
My nephew wished to accept their money at first word, and to consider what tO 
do wkh them afterwards; but 1 overruled him in that part, for I knew what 
it was to be set on shore in a strange country; and if the Portuguese captain 
that took me up at sea had served me so, and taken all 1 had for my deliverance, 
I must have starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and perhaps a Portu* 
guese is not a much better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in their distress, 
it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures; and 
we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like or any other ex- 
tremity; that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they would 
have done for us, if we had been in their case, and they in ours; but that we 
took them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it would be a most bar- 
barous thing to take that little from them which they had saved out of the fire, 
and then set them on shore and leave them; that this would be first to save 
them from death, and then kill them ourselves; save them from drowning, and 
abandon them to starving; and, therefore, I would not let the least thing be 
taken from them. As to setting them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was an 
exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East Indies; and 
though we were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way, 
and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it 
was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on their particular account; 
nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he 
was under charter to pursue his voyage by way of Brazil; and all 1 knew we 
could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships 
homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to 
England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could not but 
be very thankful for it; but they were in very great consternation, especially for 
the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East Indies; they then 
entreated me, that as I was driven so far to the westward before I met with 
them, I would, at least, keep on the same course to the Banks of Newfound- 
land, where it was probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that they 
might hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and therefore I in- 
clined to agree to it; for, indeed, I considered that to carry this whole company 
to the East Indies, would not only be an intolerable severity upon the poor peo- 
ple, but would be ruining our whole voyage, by devouring all our provisions; 
so I thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen accident 
made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were to 
blame; for the laws of God and nature would have forbid that we, should re- 
fuse to take up two boats full of people, in such a distressed condition; and the 
nature of the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us 
to set them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance. So I consented 
that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would per- 
mit; and if not, that 1 would carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and as the 
winds had continued in the points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we 
missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for we met several ships 
bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher’s; but they 
had been so long beating up against the wind that they durst take in no passen- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


201 


gcrs, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for 
those they should take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a week after 
this that we made the Banks of Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story, we 
put all our French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to 
put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get 
provisions to victual themselves with. When I say all the French went on shore, 
I should remember, that the young priest 1 spoke of, hearing we were bound to 
the Fast Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the 
coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the 
man, and had very good reason, as will appear afterwards: also four of the sea- 
nien entered themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away S. and 
S. by E, for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind at all; 
when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as 
deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the 19th day of March, 
1694-5, when we spied a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived it 
was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could not at first know what 
to make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main- 
topmast, foremast, and bowsprit; and presently she fired a gun as a signal of 
distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at N. N. W., a fresh gale, and we 
soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadocs, but had been 
blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, 
by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both gone on 
shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent case 
for good artists to bring the ship home. They had been already nine weeks at 
sea, and had met with another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, 
which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in 
which they lost their masts. They told us they expected to have seen the 
Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the south-east, by a strong 
gale of wind at N. N. W., the same that blew now; and having no sails to work 
the ship with but a main course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury-foremast, 
which they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavoring 
to stand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost starved for want 
of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone: their bread and flesh 
were quite gone; they had not one ounce left in the ship, and had had none for 
eleven days. The only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and 
they had about half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough; some succades, 
or sweetmeats, they had at first, but they were all devoured; and they had seven 
casks of rum. 

There was a youth, and his mother, and a maid-servant on board, who were 
passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board 
the evening before the hurricane began; and having no provisions of their own 
left, they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the seamen, 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

iH^mg reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion, we 
may be sure, for the poor passengers; and they were, indeed, in such a condition 
that their misery is very hard to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me (the 
weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go on board the ship. The second 
mate, who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been on board our ship, 
and he told me, they had three passengers in the great cabm, that were in a de- 
plorable condition. “Nay,” says he, “1 believe they are dead, for 1 have heard 
nothing of them for about two days: and I was afraid to inquire after them,” 
said he, “for I had nothing to relieve them with.” 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could spare; 
and, indeed, 1 had so tar overruled things with my nephew, that I would have 
victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia, or any other part of the 
coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that 

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating too much, 
even of that little we gave them. The mate, or commander, brought six men 
with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were 
so weak that they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill, 
and half-starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and 
went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him,to eat sparingly, but set meat before him immediately; and 
he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of order; 
so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with some 
broth, which he said would be to him both food and physic; and after he had 
taken it he grew better. In the mean time, I forgot not the men; I ordered 
victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it: 
they were so exceedingly hungry that they were in a manner ravenous, and 
had no command of themselves; and two of them ate with so much greediness, 
that they were in danger of their lives the next morning. 

The sight of these people’s distress was very moving to me, and brought to 
mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island, 
where I had never the least mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; 
besides the hourly apprehensions I had of being made the food of other crea- 
tures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition 
of the ship’s company, I could not put out of my thoughts the story he had 
told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin, viz.: the ipother, her 
son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or three 
days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own 
extremities being so great; by which I understood, that they had really given 
them no food at all, and that therefore tliey must be perished, and be all lying 
dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board with 
his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that were left 
on board; but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and, with my 
mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of 
beef to boil Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while 



ROBINSON CRUSOE m 

they staid, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men taking it to 
eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was well boiled, and then to give 
every man but a very little at a time: and by this caution he preserved the men, 
vvho would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that was 
given them on purpose to save their lives. 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, and see what 
condition the poor passengers were in; and if they were alive, to comfort them, 
and give them what refreshment was proper: and the surgeon gave him a large 
pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate that was 
on board, and which he did not question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this: but, as I said above, having a great mind to see 
the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would present me with, in a 
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the captain of the ship, 
as we now called him, with me, and went myself, a little after, in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get the victuals out of 
the boiler before it was ready; but my mate observed his orders, and kept a 
good guard at the cook-room door; and the man he placed there, after using all 
possible persuasion to have patience, kept them off by force: however, he caused 
some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the 
meat, which they called brewis, and gave them every one some, to stay their 
stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety that he was obliged to give 
them but little at a time. But it was all in vain; and had I not come on board, 
and their own commander and officers with me, and with good words, and 
some threats also of giving them no more, I believe they would have broken 
into the cook-room by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace; for words 
arc indeed of very small force to a hungry belly; however, we pacified them, 
and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first, and the pext time gave 
them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature, 
and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship’s company had so little for them- 
selves, it was but too true that they had at first kept them very low, and at last 
totally neglected them: so that for six or seven days it might be said they had 
really no food at all, and for several days before very little. The poor mother, 
who, as the men reported, was a woman of sense and good breeding, had spared 
all she could so affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sank under 
it, and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with 
her back up against the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and 
her head sunk between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead My 
mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put some 
broth into her mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but could 
not speak: yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, intimatii^ 
that It was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would have said 
they should take care of him. However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
at the sight, endeavored to get some of the broth into her mouth, and, as he 
said, got two or three spoonfuls down; though I question whether he could be 
sure of it or not; but it was too late, and she died the same night. 



204 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate mother’s 
life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with 
hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having 
eaten up the rest of it: however, being young, and having more strength than 
his mother, the mate got something down his throat, and he began sensibly to 
revive; though by giving him, some time after, but two or three spoonfuls 
extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all alone upon the deck, hard 
by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and 
struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted; one of her hands was clasped round 
the frame of the chair, and she gripped it so hard that we could not easily make 
her let it go; her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together, 
set fast against the frame of the cabin table; in short, she lay just like one in 
the agonies of death, and yet she was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with the 
thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for 
her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days before, and whom she 
loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who was 
a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with great application, 
recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hands still; for she was little less 
than distracted for a considerable time after. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to consider, that 
visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where sometimes people stay 
a week or a fortnight at a place: our business was to relieve this distressed ship’s 
crew, but not lie by for them; and though they were willing to steer the same 
course with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail, to keep pace with a 
ship that had no masts; however, as their captain begged of us to help him to 
set up a main-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as 
it were, lie by him for three or four days; and then, having given him five barrels 
of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, 
flour, and what other things we could spare; and taking three casks pf sugar, 
some rum, and some picces-of-eight from them for satisfaction, we left them, 
taking on board with us, at their own earnest request, the youth and the maid, 
and all their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a pretty, well-bred, modest, 
and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as it 
seems, he had lost his father but a few months before, at Barbadoes: he begged 
of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship; for he said the cruel 
fellows had murdered his mother: and, indeed, so they had, that is to say, 
ps^ively; for they might have spared a small sustenance to the poor, helpless 
jpi|dow, that might have preserved her life, though it had been but just enough 
TO keep her alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no rignt, 
ntid therefore is remorseless and capable of no compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would carry him 
arway from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad circumstances almost 

ifX 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 205 

as those we found him in, that is to say, starving in the world. He said it mat- 
tered not whither he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that 
he was among; that the captain (by which he meant me, for he could know 
nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt 
him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be 
very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The surgeon repre- 
sented the case so affectionately to me that I yielded, and we took them both 
on board, with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could 
not be removed or come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I 
made his commander sign a writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he came 
to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he 
was related, and to deliver a letter which 1 wrote to him, and all the goods he 
had belonging to the deceased widow; which 1 suppose was not done, for I 
could never learn that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost 
at sea; being in so disabled a condition, and so far from any land, that I am of 
opinion the first storm she met with afterwards, she might founder in the sea, 
for she was leaky, and had damage in her hold, when we met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, and had hitherto a toler- 
able voyage as to weather, though, at first, the winds had been contrary. I shall 
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, weather, currents, &c., on the 
rest of our voyage; but, to shorten my story, shall observe that I came to my 
old habitation, the island, on the loth of April, 1695. It was with no small 
difficulty that I found the place; for as I came to it, and went from it, before, 
on the south and east side of the island, coming from the Brazils, so now, com- 
ing in between the main and the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor 
any landmark, 1 did not know it when 1 saw it, or know whether I saw it or not. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands in the 
mouth of the great River Oroonoque, but none for my purpose; only this I 
learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one great mistake before, 
viz.: that the continent which I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was 
really no continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from 
one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great river; and that the 
savages who came to my island were not properly those which we call Carib- 
bees, but islanders, and other barbariaus of the same kind, who inhabited nearer 
to our side tiian the rest. 

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose; some I found were 
inhabited, and some were not: on one of them I found some Spaniards, and 
thought they had lived there; but, speaking with them, found they had a sloop 
lying in a small creek hard by, and came thither to make salt, and to catch 
some pearl mussels if they could; but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, 
which lay farther north, in the latitude of 10 and 1 1 degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship, sometimes 
with the Frenchmen’s shallop, which we had found a convenient boat, and 
therefore kept her with their very good-will, at length I came fair on the 
south side of my island, and presently knew the very countenance of the place; 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

io I brought the ship to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where my 
old habitation was. 

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he knew where 
he was!* He looked about a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried, **0 
yes, O there, O yes, O there!” pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing 
and capering like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping 
into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. 

“Well, Friday,” says I, “do you think we shall find anybody here or no? and 
do you ever think we shall see your father?” The fellow stood mute as a stock 
a good while; but, when 1 named his father, the poor affectionate creature 
looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully. 
“What is the matter, Friday,” says I; “are you troubled because you may see 
your father!*” “No, no,” says he, shaking his head, “no see him more: no, never 
more see him again.” “Why so,” said I, “Friday? how do you know that?” “O 
no, O no,” says Friday, “he long ago die, long ago; he much old man.” “Well, 
well,” says I, “Friday, you don’t know; but shall we sec any one else, then?” 
The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than 1, and he points to the hill just above 
my old house; and, though wc lay half a league off, he cries out, “We see, we 
see, yes, yes, we sec much man there, and there, and there.” 1 looked, but I saw 
nobody— no, not with a perspective-glass, which was, I suppose, because I could 
not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next 
day; and there were five or six men all together, who stood to look at the ship, 
not knowing what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English ancient to be 
spread, ahd fired three guns, to give them notice we were friends; and in about 
a qu^ter of an hour after we perceived a smoke arise from the side of the creek, 
so I immediately ordered the boat out, taking Friday with me; and, hanging out 
a white flag, or a flag of truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me the 
young friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the story of my living there, and 
the manner of it, and every particular, both of myself and those I left there, and 
who was, on that account, extremely desirous to go with me. We had, besides, 
about sixteen men well armed, if we had found any new guests there which we 
did not know of; but we had no need of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, we rowed 
directly into the creek; and the first man 1 fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard 
whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face perfectly well: as to his 
habit, I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first 
but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate 
feature had spied his father at a distance, a good way off the Spaniards, where, 
indeed, I saw nothing of him; and if they had not let him go ashore, he would 
have jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to his 
fa^er, like an arrow out of a bow* It would have made any man shed tears, in 
apite of the firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor 
fallow’s joy when he came to his father; how he embraced him, kissed him, 
stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay 
do|i^ii by him; then stood and looked at him, as any one would look at a strange 



ROBINSON CRUSOE W 

picture, for a quarter of an hour together, then lay down on the ground, and 
^oked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up again, and stared at him; one 
would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would have made a dog laugh 
the next day to see how his passion ran out another way; in the morning, he 
walked along the shore, with his father, several hours, always leading him by 
the hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now and then he would come to 
the boat to fetch something or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a 
biscuit cake, or something or other that was good. In the afternoon his frolics 
ran another way; for then he would set the old man down upon the ground, and 
dance about him, and make a thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the 
while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telhng him one story or 
another of his travels, and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert him. 
In short, if the same filial affection was to be found in Christians to their 
parents, in our part of the world, one would be tempted to say there would 
hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment. 

But this is a digression: 1 return to my landing. It would be needless to take 
notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the Spaniards received me with. 
The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew very well, was he whose life I had 
saved. He came towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of 
truce also; and he not only did not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, 
no notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him. “Seignior,” said I, in 
Portuguese, “do you not know me?” At which he spoke not a word, but, giving 
his musket to the man that was with him, threw his arms abroad, saying some- 
thing in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, 
telling me he was mexcusable not to know that face again that he had once seen 
as if an angel from Heaven, sent to save his life: he said abundance of very hand- 
some things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how; and then, beckoning to 
the person that attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. He Aen 
asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, where he would give me pos- 
session of my own house again, and where I should see they had made but mean 
improvements: so I walked along with him; but alas! 1 could no more find the 
place than if I had never been there; for they had planted so many trees, and 
placed them in such a position, so tliick and close to one another, and in ten 
years’ time they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, 
except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves only, who made 
them, could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications: he told me I would 
say there was need enough of it, when they had given me an account how they 
had passed their time since their arriving in the island, especially after they had 
the misfortune to find that 1 was gone. He told me he could not but have soine 
satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, 
and to iny satisfaction; and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that oi^ 
time or other he should sec me again; but nothing that ever befell him in his 
life, he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the disappointment 
he was under when he came back to the island and found I was not mere. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind, and of 



208 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought them- 
selves much better among the savages, only that their number was so small. 
“And,” says he, “had shey been strong enough, we had been all long ago in 
purgatory;” and with that he crossed himself on the breast. “But, sir,” says he, 
“I hope you will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by neces- 
sity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm them, and make them 
our subjects, as they would not be content with being moderately our masters, 
but would be our murderers.” I answered, I was afraid of it when 1 left them 
there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that they 
were not come back, that I might have put them in possession of everything 
first, and left the others in a state of subjection, as they deserved; but if they 
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should be very far from finding 
any fault with it; for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned 
villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief. 

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had sent back, and 
with him eleven more. In the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what 
nation they were of; but he made all clear, both to them and to me. First he 
turned to me, and pointing to them, said, “These, sir, are some of the gentlemen 
who owe their lives to you;” and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he 
let them know who 1 was; upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if 
they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if they 
had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great conqueror: their 
behavior was, to the last degree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a 
manly, majestic gravity, which very well became them; and, in short, they had 
so much more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, 
much less how to return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to and conduct in the island, after my going 
away, is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents, which the former part 
of my relation will help to understand, and which will, in most of the par- 
ticulars, refer to the account 1 have already given, that I cannot but commit 
them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person, which 
will put me to the expense of ten thousand “said Ts,” and “said he’s,” and “he 
told mc’s,” and “I told him’s,” and the like; but I shall collect the facts histori- 
cally, as near as I can gather them out of my memory, from what they related to 
me, and from what I met with in my conversing with them, and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, 1 must go back to the 
circumstances in which I left the island, and in wdiich the persons were of whom 
1 am to speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat that I had sent away Friday’s 
father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages) in 
a large canoe to the main, as 1 then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard’s com- 
panions that he left behind him, in order to save them from the like calamity 
that he had been in, and in order to succor them for the present; and that, if 
possible, we might rogetlier find some way for our deliverance afterwards. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the least room to 
hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had twenty years before,— much 



209 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 

less had I any foreknowledge of what afterwards happened; I mean, of an 
English ship coming on shore there to fetch me off: and it could not be but a 
very great surprise to them, when they came back, not only to find that I was 
gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left 
behind me, which would otherwise have been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin where I 
left off, was of their own part; and I desired the Spaniard would give me a 
particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat, when I 
sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was little variety in that part, for 
nothing remarkable happened to them on the way, having had calm weather and 
a smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but that 
they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the principal man among them, 
the captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some 
time); they were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew 
that he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they were satisfied, would 
devour him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that when he told them the 
story of his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them 
away, it was like a dream to them, and their astonishment, he said, was some- 
what like that of Joseph’s brethren, when he told them who he was, and the 
story of his exaltation in Pharaoh’s court; but when he showed them the arms, 
the powder, the ball, and provisions, that he brought them for their journey or 
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their 
deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away with him. 

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were obliged not to 
stick so much upon the honesty of it, but to trespass upon their friendly savages, 
and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, 
or for pleasure. In these they came away the next morning. It seems they 
wanted no time to get themselves ready; for they had no baggage, neither 
clothes, nor provisions, nor anything in the world but what they had on them, 
and a few roots to cat, of which they used to make their bread. 

They were, in all, three weeks absent; and in that time, unluckily for them, 
I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I mentioned in the other part, and 
to get off from the island, leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, un- 
govemed, disagreeable villains behind me, that any man could desire to meet 
with; to the poor Spaniards’ great grief and disappointment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards came ashore, 
they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions, and other relief, as I 
had ordered them to do; also they gave them the long paper of directions which 
I had left for them, containing the particular methods which I took for manag- 
ing every part of my life there; the way I baked my bread, bred my tame goats, 
and planted my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, 
everything I did; all this, being written down, they gave to the Spaniards (two 
of them understood English well enough); nor did tney refuse to accommodate 
the Spaniards with anything else, for they agreed very well for some time. 
They gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave, and they began 
to live very sociably; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

methods, and Friday’s father together, managed all their affairs; but as for the 
Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and 
camh tortoises; and when they came home at night, the Spaniards provided 
their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the others but let 
them alone; which, however, they could not find in their hearts to do long; 
but, like the dog m the manger, they would not eat themselves, neither would 
they let the others eat. The differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, 
and such as are not worth relating, but at last it broke out into open war: and 
it began with all the rudeness and insolence that can be imagined,— without 
reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed, to common sense; 
and though, it is true, the first relation of it came from the Spaniards them- 
selves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when 1 came to examme the fellows, 
they could not deny a word of it. i 

But before 1 come to the particulars of this part, I must supply a defect in my 
former relation, and this was, I forgot to set down, among the rest, that just as 
we were weighing anchor to set- sail, there happened a little quarrel on board of 
our ship, which I was once afraid would hav c turned to a second mutiny; nor 
was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his 
assistance, parted them by force, and, making two of the most refractory fellows 
prisoners, he laid them in irons: and as they had been active in the former 
disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous words, the second time he tlireat- 
ened to carry them in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mu- 
tiny, and running away with the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not 
intend to do it, frightened some other men in the ship, and some of them had 
put it into the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave them good words 
for the present, till they should come to some English port, and that then they 
should be all put in jail, and tried for their lives. The mate got intelligence of 
this, and acquainted us with it; upon which it was desired that I, who still 
passed for a great man among them, should go down with the mate, and satisfy 
the men, and tell them that they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest 
of the voyage, all they had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, 
and after passing my honor’s word to them, they appeared easy, and the more 
so when I caused the two men that were in irons to be released and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night; the wind also 
falling next morning, we found that our two men, who had been laid in irons, 
had stolen each of them a musket, and some other weapons (what powder or 
shot they had we knew not), and had taken the ship’s pinnace, which was not 
yet hauled up, and run away with her to their companions in roguery on shore. 
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore with twelve men 
md the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues; but they could neither 
find them nor any of the rest, for they all fled into the woods when they saw 
iJie boat coming on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to their 
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burned all their household stuff 
and furniture, and left them to shut without it; but having no orders, he let it 
all alone, left everything as he found it, and, bringing the pinnace away, came 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 2H 

on board without them. These two men made their number five; but the otber 
three villains were so much more wicked than they, that after they had been 
two or three days together, they turned the two new-comers out of doors to 
shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them; nor could they, 
for a good while, be persuaded to give them any food: as for the SpaniareJs, 
they were not yet cotne. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go forward: 
the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in 
their countrymen again, that, as they said, they might be all one family; but 
they would not hear of it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and 
finding nothing but industry and application would make them live comfort- 
ably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a little more 
to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who always landed on the east 
parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up their 
magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards having given them some com for 
seed, and some of the peas which 1 had left them, they dug, planted, and en- 
closed after the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live pretty well. 
Their first crop of corn was on the ground; and though it was but a little bit 
of land which they had dug up at first, having had but a litdc time, yet it was 
enough to relieve them, and find them with bread and other eatables; and one 
of the fellows, being the cook’s mate of the ship, was very ready at makinff 
soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the milk, and such 
little flesh as they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving position when the three unnatural 
rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humor, and to insult them, came 
and bullied them, and told them the island was theirs: that the governor, mean- 
ing me, had given them the possession of it, and nobody else had any right to 
it; and that they should build no houses upon their ground, unless they would 
pay rent for them. 

^ The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked them to come in and 
sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they had built, and to tell them 
what rent they demanded; and one of them merrily said, if they were the 
ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built tenements upon their land, and made 
improvements, they would, according to the custom of landlords, grant a long 
lease; and desired they would get a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the 
three, cursing and raging, told them they should see they were not in jest; and 
going to a little place at a distance, where the honest men had made a fire to 
dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand, and claps it to the outside of their hut, 
and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have been all burned down in a few 
niinutes, if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod 
the fire out with his feet, and that not without some difiSiculty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man’s thrusting him away, that 
he returned upon him, with a pole he had in his hand; and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended his days at 
once. His comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and 



212 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

immediately they came both out with their muskets, and the man that was 
first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down that began the quarrel, 
with the stock of his musket, and that before the other two could come to help 
him; and then seeing the rest come at them, they stood together, and presenting 
the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off. 

The others had fire-arms with them too; but one of the two honest men, 
bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his danger, told them, if they 
offered to move hand or foot, they were dead men, and boldly commanded 
them to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but 
seeing him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and tliey consented to take 
their wounded man with them and be gone: and, indeed, it seems the fellow 
was wounded sufficiently with the blow. However, they were much in the 
wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually, 
as they might have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and 
given them an account how the rogues had treated them; for the three villains 
studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave them some intimation that 
they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of the rogueries, 
such as treading down tlicir corn; shooting three young kids and a shc-goat, 
which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store; and, in a word, 
plaguing them night and day in this manner; it forced the two men to such a 
desperation, that thej^ resolved to fight them all three, tlie first time they had a 
fair opportunity. In order to do this, they resolved to go to the castle, as they 
called it (that was my old dwelling), where the three rogues and the Spaniards 
all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards 
should stand by to see fair play: so they got up in the morning before day, and 
came to the place, and called the Englishmen by their names, telling the Span- 
iards, that answered, that they wanted to speak with them. 

It happened that, the day before, two of the Spaniards, having been in the 
woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I called the 
honest men, and he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous 
usage they had met with from their three countrymen, and how they had 
ruined their plantation, and destroyed their com that they had labored so 
hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kids, which was 
all they had provided for their sustenance; and that if he and his friends (mean- 
ing the Spaniards) did not assist them again, they should be starved. \Vhen the 
Spaniards came home at night, and they were all at supper, one" of them took 
the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle and man- 
nerly terms, and asked them how they could be so cruel, they being harmless, 
inoffensive fellows: that they were putting themselves in a way to subsist by 
their labor, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to 
such perfection as they were then in. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, “What had they to do there? 
that they came on shore without leave; and that they should not plant or build 
upon the island; it was none of their ground.” “Why,” says the Spaniard, very 
calmiy» “Seignior Inglese, they must not starve.” The Englishman replied, like 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 213 

a rough-hewn tarpauling, “They might starve: they should not plant nor build 
in that place.” “But what must they do then, seignior?” said the Spaniard. 
Another of the brutes returned, “Do? they should be servants, and work for 
them.” “But how can you expect that of them?” says the Spaniard; “they are 
not bought with your money; you have no right to make them servants.” The 
Englii>hman answered, “The island was theirs; the governor had given it to 
them, and no man had anything to do there but themselves;” and with that 
swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all their new huts; they should 
build none upon their land. “Why, seignior,” says the Spaniard, “by the same 
rule, we must be your servants too.” “Ay,” says the bold dog, “and so you shall, 
too, before w e have done w ith you;” mixing two or three oaths in the proper 
intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no 
answer. However, this little discourse had heated them; and starting up, one 
sa}'s to the other (1 think it was he they called Will Atkins), “Come, Jack, let’s 
go, and have t’other brush with them; we’ll demolish their castle, I’ll warrant 
you; they shall plant no colony in our dominions.” 

Upon this, they went all trooping away, with every man a gun, a pistol, and 
a sw^ord, and muttered some insolent things among themselves, of what they 
would do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered; but the Spaniards, 
it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars, 
only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the two Englishmen’s 
part. 

Whither they wxnt or how they bestowed their time that evening the Span- 
iards said they did not know^; but it seems they wandered about the country, 
part of the night, and then lying down in the place which I used to call my 
bower, they were weary and overslept themselves. The case was this: they had 
resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor men when they were 
asleep, and as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts 
vvhile they were in them, and either bum them there, or murder them as they 
came out. As malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should 
not have been kept awake. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I have said, though 
a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very 
luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad before the bloody- 
minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, who, it seems, was 
the forwardest man, called out to his comrade, “Ha, Jack, here’s the nest, but 
the birds are flown.” They mused awhile, to think what should be the occasion 
of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the Spaniards 
had given them notice of it; and with that they shook hands, and swore to one 
another that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had 
made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor men’s habitation; they 
did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but they pulled down both their houses, 
and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not the least stick staiiding, or 
scarce any sign on the ground where they stood; they tore all their little col- 
lected household stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in such a manner. 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


m 

that the poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile off their habita- 
tion. When they had done this, they pulled up all the young trees which the 
poor men had planted; pulled up an enclosure they had made to secure their 
cattle and their corn, and, in a word, sacked and plundered everything as com- 
pletely as a horde of Tartars would have done. 

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them out, and had resolved 
to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but two to three; so 
that, had they met, there certainly would have been bloodshed among them; for 
they were all very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they themselves 
could do to meet; for, as if they had dogged one another, when the three were 
gone thither, the two were here* and afterwards, when the two went back to 
find them, the three were come to the old habitation again: we shall see their 
different conduct presently. When the tliree came back like furious creatures, 
flushed with the rage which the work they had been about had put them into, 
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way of 
scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if 
they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his 
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face, says to him, “And you, 
Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your 
manners.” The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil man, was as brave a man 
as could be, and, uithal, a strong well-made man, looked at him for a good 
while, and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, 
with one blow of his fist, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe, 
at which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard 
immediately: he missed his body, indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, 
but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood 
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really was, and that put 
him into some heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm, but now, resolving 
to go through with his work, he stooped, and took the fellow’s musket whom 
he had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the man who had fired at 
him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and calling 
to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, and took their arms 
from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the Spaniards 
their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they began to cool^ and giving 
the Spaniards better words, would have had their arms again; bilt the Spaniards, 
considering the feud that was between them and the other two Englishmen, 
and that it would be the best method they could take to keep them from 
killing one another, told them they would do them no harm; and if they would 
live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and associate with them as 
they did before; but that they could not think of giving them their arms again, 
while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own 
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to act with reason; 
but being refused their arms, they went raving away, and raging like madmen, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 21S 

threatening what they would do, though they had no fire-arms. But die Spaiv* 
iards, despising their threatening, told them they should take care how they 
offered any injury to their plantation or cattle; for if they did, they should 
shoot them as they would ravenous beasts, wherever they found them; and if 
they fell into their hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. However, this 
was far from cooling them, but away they went, raging and swearing like furies 
of hell. As soon as they were gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage 
enough also, though of another kind; for having been at their plantation, and 
finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they 
had provocation enough. They could scarce have room to tell their tale, the 
Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange enough to find 
that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at all. 

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having thus disarmed 
them, made light of their threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved to have 
their remedy against them, what pains soever it cost to find them out. But the 
Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, that as they had disarmed them, 
they could not consent that they (the two) should pursue them with fire-arms, 
and perhaps kill them, “But,” said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, 
“we will endeavor to make them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for 
there is no doubt but they will come to us again, when their passion is over, 
being not able to subsist without our assistance. We promise you to make no 
peace with them without having a full satisfaction for you; and, upon this 
condition, we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than 
in your own defence.” The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, 
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested that they did it only to 
keep them from bloodshed, and to make them all easy at last. “For,” said they, 
“we are not so many of us; here is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity 
that we should not be all good friends.” At length they did consent, and 
waited for the issue of the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards; for 
their own habitation was destroyed. 

In about five days’ time, the three vagrants, tired wdth wandering, and almost 
starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles’ eggs all that while, came 
back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the 
governor, and two more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came 
up in a very submissive. Humble manner, and begged to be received again into 
the family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they had acted so 
unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very grossly to them (the Spaniards), 
that they could not come to any conclusion without consulting the two Eng- 
lishmen and the rest; but, however, they would go to them and discourse about 
It, and they should know in half an hour. It may be guessed that they were 
very hard put to it; for, it seems, as they were to wait this half hour for an 
answer, they begged they would send them out some bread in the mean time, 
which they did, sending, at the same time, a large piece of goat’s flesh, and a 
boiled parrot, which they ate very heartily, for tliey were hungry enough. 

After half an hour’s consultation, they were called in, and a long debate 
ensued, their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their labor.

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


and a design to murder them; all which they owned before, and therefore could 
not deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators between 
them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while 
they were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild 
their fellows’ two huts, one to be of the same and the other of larger dimensions 
than they were before; to fence their ground again where they had pulled 
up their fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land 
again for planting corn where they had spoiled it, and, in a word, to restore 
eyerything to the same state as they found it, as near as they could; for entirely 
it could not be, the season for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges, 
not being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of provisions given 
them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the w'hole society began to live 
pleasantly and agreeably together again; only that these three fellows could 
never be persuaded to work— I mean for themselves—except now and then a 
little, just as they pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if 
they would but live sociably and friendly together, and study the good of the 
whole plantation, they would be content to work for them, and let them walk 
about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus, having lived pretty well together 
for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave them liberty 
to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went abroad, before 
the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome as ever; but, 
however, an accident happened presently upon this, which endangered the 
safety of them all; and they were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and 
look to the preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spanish governor, as I call him,— that is to say, 
the Spaniard whose life I had saved,— who was now the captain, or leader, or 
governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no 
means get any sleep; he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only 
found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men fighting and killing one 
another; but he was broad awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; 
in short, he lay a great while, but, growling more and more uneasy, he resolved 
to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, on goat-skins laid thick upon such 
couches and pads as they made for themselves, and not in hammocks and 
ship-beds as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do, when they were 
willing to rise, but to get upon their feet, and perhaps put on a* coat, such as 
it was, and their pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their 
thoughts guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out; but, being dark, he 
could see little or nothing: and, besides, the trees which 1 had planted, as in my 
former account is described, and which were now grown tall, intercepted his 
sight, so that he could only look up, and see that it was a clear starlight night, 
and, hearing no noise, he returned and laid him down again; but it was all one: 
he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything like rest; but his 
thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not for what. 

Haling made some noise with rising and walking about, going out and com- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 217 

ing in, another of them waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was up. 
The governor told him how it had been with him. “Say you so? ” says the other 
Spaniard; “such things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly 
some mischief working near us;” and presently he asked him, “Where are the 
Englishmen?” “They are all in their huts,” says he, “safe enough.” It seems the 
Spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a place for 
the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were always quartered by 
themselves, and could not come at the rest. “Well,” says the Spaniard, “there is 
something in it, I am persuaded, from my own experience. 1 am satisfied our 
spirits embodied have a converse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits 
unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is 
given for our advantage, if we knew how to make use of it. Come,” says he, “let 
us go and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to justify the trouble, 
ril tell you a story to the purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my 
proposing it.” 

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill, where I used to 
go, but they, being strong, and a good company, not alone, as I was, used none 
of my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and pulling it up after them, to go up 
a second stage to the top, but were going round through the grove, uncon- 
cerned and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a 
very little way off from them, and hearing the voices of men— not of one or 
two, but of a great number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on the island, it was 
my constant care to prevent them making the least discovery of there being 
any inhabitant upon the place; and when by any occasion they came to know 
it, they felt it so effectually that they that got away were scarce able to give 
any account of it; for we disappeared as soon as possible; nor did ever any that 
had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it was the three savages in our 
last encounter, who jumped into the boat; of whom, I mentioned, I was afraid 
they should go home and bring more help. Whether it was the consequence of 
the escape of those men that so great a number came now together, or whether 
they came ignorantly, and by accident, on their usual bloody errand, the 
Spaniards could not, it seems, understand; but, whatever it was, it had been their 
business either to have concealed themselves, or not to have seen them at all, 
much less to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in 
the place; or to have fallen upon them so effectually as that not a man of them 
should have escaped, which could only have been by getting in between them 
and their boats; but this presence of mind w^as wanting to them, which was the 
ruin of their tranquillity for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, surprised 
with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an 
account of the imminent danger they were all m, and they again as readily took 
the alarm; but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where 
they were, but they must all run out to see how things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and tliey had opportunity 
enough, for some hours, to view them by the light of three fires they had made 



WORKS OF DAMEL DEFOE 


at a distance from one another; what they were doing they knew not, and what 
to do themselves they knew not. For, first, the enemy were too many; and, 
secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided into several parties, and 
v^ere on shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; and, as they found 
that the fellows ran stragglmg all over the shore, they made no doubt but, first 
or last, some of them would chop in upon their habitation, or upon some other | 
place where they would see the token of inhabitants; and they were in greatl 1 

f )erplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would have been little 
ess than starving them, if they should have been destroyed; so the first thing 
they resolved upon was to despatch three men away before it was light, two ' 
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the great valley ' 
where the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the very cave itself. ' 
Could they have seen the savages all together in one body, and at a distance 
from their canoes, they resolved, if there had been a hundred of them, to have 
attacked them; but that could not be obtained, for they were some of them 
two miles off from the other; and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two dif- 
ferent nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course they should take, and beat- j 
ing their brains in considering their present circumstances, they resolved, at i 
last, while it was still dark, to send the old savage, Friday’s father, out as a spy, | 
to learn, if possible, something concerning them,— as what they came for, what 
they intended to do, and the like. The old man readily undertook it; and strip- 
ping himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went. After he 
had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he had been among them 
undiscovered,— that he found they were two parties, and of two several nations, 
who had war with one another, and had a great battle in their own country, 
and that both sides having had several prisoriers taken in the fight, they were, by 
mere chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring of their prisoners 
and making merry; but their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled | 
all their mirth,— that they were in a great rage at one another, and were so near, 
that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but 
he did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody being on the island 
but themselves. He had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they 
could perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little armies were 
engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday’s father used all the arguments he could to persuade dur people to lie 
close, and not be seen; he told them their safety consisted in it, and that they 
had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages would kill one another to their 
hands, and then the rest would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was 
impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so 
importunate upon their prudentials, that they must run out and see the battle, 
however, they used some caution, too; they did not go openly, just by their 
own dwelUng, but went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to ad- 
vantage, where they might securely see them manage the fight and, as they 



ROBINSON C31USOE 219 

thought, not be seen by them; but it seems the savages did see them, as we shall 
find hereafter* 

The battle was very fierce; and, if I might believe the Englishmen, one of 
them said he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery, of 
invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the fight. The battle, they said, 
held two hours before they could guess which party would be beaten; but then 
that party which was nearest our people’s habitation began to appear weakest, 
and after some time more, some of them began to fly; and this put our men 
again into a great consternation, lest any one of those that fled should run into 
the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover 
die place; and that, by consequence, the pursuers would do the like in search 
of them. Upon this, they resolved that they would stand armed within the wall, 
and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to sally out over the wall and 
kill them, so that, if possible, not one should return to give an account of it; 
they ordered also that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking 
them down with the stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear 
of raising an alarm by the noise. 

As they expected it fell out; three of the routed army fled for life, and cross- 
ing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least knowing whither they 
went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look 
abroad gave notice of this within, with this addition, to our men’s great satis- 
faction, viz.: that the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way 
they were gone: upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would 
not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out by the 
top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in behind them, and surprise 
and take them prisoners; which was done. The residue of the conquered people 
fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the victors retired, made no pursuit, or 
very little, but drawing themselves into a body together, gave two great scream- 
ing shouts, which they supposed was by way of triumph— and so the fight 
ended, and the same day, about three o’clock in the afternoon, they ^so 
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had the island again free to 
themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages for several years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and viewing 
the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty men dead on the spot: 
some were killed with great long arrows, some of which were found sticking 
m their bodies; but most of them were killed with great wooden swords, sixteen 
or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle, and as many bows, 
with a great many arrows. These swords were strange, great unwieldy things, 
and they must be very strong men that used them; most of those men that 
were killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as 
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several their arms and legs 
broken; so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury. We 
found not one man that was not stone dead,— for either they stay by their enemy 
till they have killed him, or they carry all the wounded men that are not quite 
dead away with them.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while; the sight had filled 
them with horror, and the consequences appeared terrible to the last degree, 
especially upon supposing that some time or other they should fall into the 
hands of those creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies, but kill 
them for food, as we kill our cattle; and they professed to me that the thoughts 
of being eaten up like beef and mutton, though it was supposed it was not to 
be till they were dead, had something in it so horrible that it nauseated their 
very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and filled their minds 
with such unusual terror, that they were not themselves for some weeks aftei 
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes 1 have been speaking of) 
and for a great while after they were tractable, and went about the common^ 
business of the whole society well enough,— planted, sowed, reaped, and began 
to be all naturalized to the country. But some time after this tlicy fell into such 
simple measures again, as brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these three being lusty 
stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them to work for 
them; and as slaves they did well enough; but they did not take their 
measures with them as I did by my man Friday, viz.: to begin with them upon 
the principle of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the rational 
principles of life,— much less of religion,- civilizing and reducing them by kind 
usage and affectionate arguments; but as they gave them their food every day, 
so they gave them their work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery 
enough; but they failed in this by it, that they never had them to assist them and 
fight for them as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh 
upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends, for common 
danger, as 1 said above, had effectually reconciled them, they began to consider 
their general circumstances; and the first thing that came under consideration 
was whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island, 
and that there were more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their 
way of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather move 
their habitation, and plant in some more proper place for their safety, and espe- 
cially for the security of their cattle and corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would not remoie 
their habitation; because that, some time or other, they thought they might 
hear from their governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any one to 
seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that side, where, if they should 
find the place demolished, they would conclude the savages had killed us all, 
and we were gone, and so our supply would go too. But as to their corn and 
cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave was, where 
the land was as proper for both, and where, indeed, there was land enough, 
however, upon second thoughts, they altered one part of their resolution too, 
and resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part of their 
corn there; and so if one part was destroyed, the other might be saved. And 
one part of prudence they used, which it was very well they did,-~that they 
never trusted those three savages which they had prisoners with knowing any- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE

thing of the plantation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had 
there, much less of the cave there, which they kept, in case of necessity, as a 
safe retreat; and thither they carried also the two barrels of powder, which I 
had sent them at my coming away. But, however, they resolved not to change 
their habitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully covered it first with a 
wall or fortification, and then with a grove of trees, so, seeing their safety 
consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which they were now fully con- 
vinced, they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually 
dian before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes, which 
in time all grew up to be trees, for some good distance before the entrance into 
iny apartments, they went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of that 
whole space of ground from the trees I had set quite down to the side of the 
creek, where, as I said, i landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where 
the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any sign that there 
had been any landing thereabouts,— these stakes also being of a wood very 
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took care to have them 
generally much larger and taller than those which 1 had planted; and as they 
grew apace, so they planted them so very thick and clo>e together, that when 
they had been three or four years grown, there was no piercing with the eye 
any considerable way into the plantation; and as for that part which 1 had 
planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man’s thigh, and among them they 
placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a 
palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate 
It, but with a little army to cut it all down,— for a little dog could hardly get 
between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground to the right 
hand and to the left, and round even to the side of the hill, leaving no way, not 
so much as for themselves, to come out but by the ladder placed up to the 
side of the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from the first stage up to 
the top; and when the ladder w as taken down, nothing but what had wings or 
witchcraft to assist it could come at them. This was excellently well contrived; 
nor w^as it less than what they afterwards found occasion for, which served to 
convince me, that as human prudence has the authority of Providence to 
justify it, so it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to work; 
and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded we might prevent 
many of the disasters which our lives arc now, by our own negligence, sub- 
jected to. 

1 return to the story. They lived tw^o years after this in perfect retirement, 
and had no more visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an alarm given them 
one morning, w^hich put them into a great consternation; for, some of the 
Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side, or rather end, of the 
island (which was that end where I never went, for fear of being discovered), 
they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on 
shore. They made the best of their way home in hurry enough; and giving the 
alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that day and the next, going out 
t>nly at night to make their observation; but they had the good luck to be 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


iDistaken^ for wherever the savages went, they did not land that time on the 
island, but pursued some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one of whom, 
a most turbulent fellow, being m a rage at one of the three slaves, whom I 
mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had not done something right 
which he bade him do, and seemed a httle untractable in his showing him, drew 
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and fell upon th^ 
poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, wh(^ 
was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he\ 
aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut 
the poor creature’s arm off, ran to him and entreatmg him not to murder the 
poor man, placed himself between him and the savage, to prevent the mischief. 
The fellow, being cm aged the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his 
hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage, 
which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided tlie blow, and with a shovel which he 
had m his hand (for they sscre all working in the field about then corn land) 
knocked the brute down. Another of the Englishmen, running at the same 
0me to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard dou n, and then two Spaniards 
more came m to help their man, and a third Englishman fell in upon them 
They had none of them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but hatchets 


and other tools, except this third Englishman, he had one of my rusty cudasscs, 
with which he made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both. This 
fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they took 
the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what should be done 
with them^* 1 hey had been so often mutinous, and they were so very furious, 
so desperate, and so idle withal, they knew not what course to take with them, 
for they were mischievous to the highest degree, and cared not what hurt 
they did to any man, so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, that if they 
had been of his own country, he would have hanged them, for all laws and all 
governors were to preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the 
society ought to be expelled out of it, but as they were Enghshmen, and that 
it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their 
preservation and dehverance, he would use them with all possible lenity, and 
would leave them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were 
their countrymen. # 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it might 
not be left to them. “For,” says he, “I am sure we ou^ht to sentence them to the 
gallows,” and w ith that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, 
nad proposed to have all the five Englishmen join together, and murder all the 
Spaniards when they were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins, “How, 
Seignior Atkins, would you murder us alP What have you to say to that?” The 
hardened villain w as so far from denying it, that he said it was true, ^d swore 
thty would do it still before they had done with them. “Well, but, Seignior 
AtkinSf” Says the Spaniard, “what have we done to you, that you would kill us^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 223 

And what would you pt by killing us? And what must we do to prevent your 
killing us? Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why will you put us to the neces<* 
sity of this, Seignior Atkins?” says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. 
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard’s making a jest of it, that, 
had he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapon near him, it was 
thought he would have attempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of aU the 
company. This hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was 
to be done; the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, 
were of the opinion that they should hang one of the three, for an example to 
the rest, and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to com- 
mit murder with his hatchet; and, indeed, there was some reason to believe he 
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the 
wound he had received, that it was thought he could not live. But the governor 
Spaniard still said no; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and 
he would never consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had mur- 
dered half of them, —nay, he said if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, 
and had time left to speak, it should be that they should pardon him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that there was 
no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where they 
arc so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it was to be considered 
what should be done to keep them from doing the mischief they designed; for 
all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be used for preserving the 
society from danger. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that they should 
be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any 
weapon; and should be turned out of the society, and left to live where they 
would, and how they would, by themselves; but that none of the rest, either 
Spanish or English, should converse with them, speak with them, or have any- 
thing to do with them; that they should be forbid to come within a certain 
distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they ofiFered to commit any 
disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buila- 
ings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they should die without mercy, 
and they would shoot them wherever they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentence, con- 
sidered a little Upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, “Hold; 
you must reflect that it will be long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their 
own, and they must not starve; we must therefore allow them provisions.” So 
he caused to be added, that they should have a proportion of corn given them 
to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time they might be 
!>upposed to raise some of their own; that they should have six milch-goats, 
four he-goats and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as for a 
store; and that they should have tools given them for their work in the fields, 
s»uch as six hatchets, and adz, a saw, and the like; but they should have none of 
these tools or provisions, unless they would swear solemnly that they would not 
hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow-Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift for 
themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as neither content to go 



224 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


away nor to stay; but, as there was no remedy, they went, pretending to go 
and choose a place where they would settle themselves; and some provisions 
were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, and gave 
the governor an account where they had pitched their tents, and marked 
themselves out a habitation and plantation; and it was a very convenient place, 
indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N. E., much about the place wheiie 
I providentially landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea, tHe 
Lord knows whither, in my foolish attempt to sail round the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them in a 
manner like my first habitation, being close under the side of a hill, having 
some trees growling already on tliree sides of it, so that by planting others, it 
would be very easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for. 
They desired some dried goat-skins, for beds and covering, which were given 
them; and upon giving their words that they w ould not disturb the rest, or 
injure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools 
they could spare; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing; and, in a word, 
anything they wanted, except arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got in their 
first harvest, thcjugh the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they had 
planted being but little; for, indeed, having all their plantation to form, they 
had a great deal of work upon their hands, and v hen they came to make 
boards and pots, and such things, they were quite out of tlicir clement, and 
could make nothing of it, and w^hen the rainy season came on, for want of a 
cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in great danger 
of spoiling; and this humbled them much: so they came and begged the 
Spaniards to help them, wdiich they very readily did; and in four days worked 
a great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure their corn and 
other things from the rain: but it was a poor place, at best, compared to mine, 
and especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and 
made several new apartments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic took these 
rogues, which, together with the former villany they had committed, brought 
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin of the whole 
colony. The three new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious 
life they led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstances: and a 
whim took them that they would make a voyage to the continent, from whence 
the savages came, and would try if they could seize upon some prisoners among 
the natives there, and bring them home, so as to make them do the laborious 
part of the work for them. 

The project was nor so preposterous, if they had gone no further. But they 
did nothing, but had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the event. 
And if I may gh c my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven; 
for if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we 
reconcile the events of things with the Divine justice? It was certainly an ap- 
parent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


225 


state they were in; and they showed not the least remorse for the crime, but 
added new villanies to it, such as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a 
poor slave because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he 
was directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple all 
his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure; 
{ind, v^hat was still worse, the murderous intent, or, to do justice to the crime, 
the intentional murder, —for such, to be sure, it was,--as was afterwards the 
formed design they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their 
sleep. 

But I leave observing, and return to the story. The three fellows came down 
to the Spaniards one morning, and in very humble terms desired to be admitted 
to speak with them. The Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, 
which was this: that they were tired of living in the manner they did, and that 
they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and that 
having no help, they found they should be starved; but if the Spaniards would 
give them leave to take one of the canoes which the}' came over in, and give 
them arms and ammunition proportioned to their defence, they w'ould go over 
to tlic main, and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them from the trouble of 
su})plying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very honestly repre- 
sented to them the certain destruction they were running into; told them they 
had suffered such hardships upon that very spot, that they could, without any 
spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved or murdered, and bade them 
consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they staid here, for 
they could not work, and would not work, and they could but be starved 
abroad; and if they were murdered, there was an end of them; they had no 
wives or children to cry after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon 
their demand, declaring they would go, whether they gave them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were resolved to go, 
they should not go like naked men, and be in no condition to defend them- 
selves; and that though they could ill spare their fire-arms, having not enough 
for themselves, yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a 
cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them. 
In a word, they accepted the offer; and having baked bread enough to serve 
them a month, and given them as much goats’ flesh as they could eat while it 
was sweet, and a great basket of dried grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a younjg 
kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it 
was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have carried fifteen 
twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for them to manage; but as 
they had a fair breeze, and flood-tide with them, they did well enough. Thev 
had made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, whicn 
they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily enough. The 
Spaniards called after them, “Bow veya]of and no man ever thought of seeing 
them any more. 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two honest 
Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and comfortably they lived, 
now these three turbulent fellows were gone. As for their coming again, that 
was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could be imagined, when, 
behold, after two-and-twenty days’ absence, one of the Englishmen, being 
abroad upon his planting-work, sees three strange men coming towards him at 
a distance, u ith guns upon their shoulders. 

Awa\ runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes frightened an^ 
amazed to tlie gov ernor Spaniard, and tells hmi they were all undone, for ther<( 
were strangers upon the island, but could not tell who they were. The Span- 
iard, pausing awhile, says to him, “How do you mean— you cannot tell who^ 
They are the savages, to be sure.” “No, no,” says the Englishman, “they arc 
men m clothes, with arms ” “Nay, then,” says the Spaniard, “why are you so 
concerned^ If they arc not savages, they must be friends, for there is no 
Chrisaan nation upon earth but will do us good rather than harm ” 

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and, standing 
without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed to them They presently 
knew their voices, and so all the wonder ceased But now the admiration was 
turned upon another quesaon—what could be the matter, and what made them 
come back again^ 

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring where they 
had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a full account of their 
voyage in a few words,— that they reached the land in two days, or something 
less, but finding the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing with bows 
and arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the 
northward six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by which they 
perceived that the land they saw from our island was not the main, but an 
island. Upon entering that opening of the sea, they saw another island on the 
right hand, north, and several more west, and being resolved to land some- 
where, they put over to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on 
shore, that they found the people very courteous and friendly to them, and 
that they gave them several roots and some dried fish, and appeared very 
sociable, and the women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply them 
with anythmg they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a great 
way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as they could of them, 
by signs, what nations were this way, and that way, and were told of several 
fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way, who, as they made known 
by signs to them, used to eat men, but, as for themselves, they said, they never 
ate men or women, except only such as they took in the wars, and then, they 
owned, they made a great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen mquired when they had had a feast of that kind, and they 
told them about tvo moons ago, pomting to the moon and to two fingers, 
tod that their great king had two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken 
in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. 
The Enghshmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing those prisoners; but the 



ROBINSON C31USOE 227 

others, mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have some of them to 
carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the 
setting of the sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify that the next 
morning at sunrising they would bring some for them; and, accordingly, the 
next morning they brought down five women and eleven men, and gave them 
to the Englishmen, to carry with them on their voyage, just as we would bring 
so many cows and oxen down to a seaport town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their stomachs turned 
at this sight, and they did not know what to do. To refuse the prisoners would 
have been the highest affront to the savage gentry that could be offered them, 
and what to do with them they knew not. However, after some debate, they 
resolved to accept of them; and, in return, they gave the savages that brought 
them one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their bullets, 
which, though they did not understand their use, they seemed particularly 
pleased with; and then tying the poor creatures’ hands behind them, they 
dragged the prisoners into the boat for our men. 

1 he Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had them, or 
else they that gave t:hein this noble present would certainly have expected that 
they should have gone to work with them, have killed two or three of them the 
next morning, and, perhaps, have invited the donors to dinner. But having taken 
their leave, with all the respect and thanks that could well pass between 
people, where, on either side, they understood not one word they could say, 
they put off with their boat, and came back towards the first island; where, 
when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being too 
many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage, they endeavored to have some communication with their 
prisoners; but it was impossible to make them understand anything. Nothing 
they could say to them, or give them, or do for them, but what was looked 
upon as going to murder them. They first of all unbound them; but the poor 
creatures screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had just felt the 
knife at their throats; for they immediately concluded they were unbound on 
purpose to be killed. If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same thing; 
they then concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat 
enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more particularly, the party 
presently concluded it was to sec whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to 
kill first; nay, after they had brought them quite over, and began to use them 
kindly, and treat them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner 
or supper for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or journal of 
their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new famDy was; and being 
told that they had brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huts, 
and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the 
other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down 
to the place and see them; and did so, and Friday’s father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat, all bound; for when they had 
brought them on shore, they bound their hands, that they might not take the 



228 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


boat and make their escape; there, 1 say, they sat, all of them stark naked. 
First, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, straight and 
fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age; and five women, whereof 
two might be from thirty to forty; two more not above four or five and 
twenty; and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The 
women were well-favored, agreeable persons, both in shape and features, only 
tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect white, would have passed % 
very handsome women, even in London itself, having pleasant, agreeable 
countenances, and of a very modest behavior; especially when they came after- 
wards to be clothed and dressed, as they called it, though that dress was very 
indifferent, it must be confessed. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards, who 
were, to give them a just character, men of the best behavior, of the most 
calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humor, that ever 1 met with; and, in 
particular, of the most modesty; 1 say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three 
naked men and five naked women, all together bound, and in the most miserable 
circumstances that human nature could be supposed to be, viz.: to be expect- 
ing every moment to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked out, and 
then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday’s father, to go 
in, and see, first, if he knew any of them, and then if he understood any of 
their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but 
knew none of them; neither could any of them understand a word he said, 
or a sign he could make, except one of the women. However, this was enough 
to answer the end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands 
they were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred eating men or women, 
and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As soon as they were 
assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward gestures, 
several ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of several nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask 
them if they were willing to be servants, and to work for the men who had 
brought them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a dancing; and 
presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, anything that lay next, 
to carry on their shoulders, to intimate they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women among them would 
presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might: occasion so^c 
strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intended to do with 
these women, and how they intended to use them, whether as servants or 
as wives? One of the Englishmen answered, very boldly and readily, that they 
would use them as both; to which the governor said, “I am not going w 
restrain you from it—you are your own masters as to that; but this I think is 
but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and 1 desire it of you 
for that reason only, viz.: that you will all engage, that if any of you take any 
of these women as a wife, that he shall take but one; and that, having taken 
one, none else shall touch her; for though we cannot marry any one of you» 
yet it is but reasonable that, while you stay here, the woman any of you takes 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 229 

shall be maintained by the man that takes her, and should be his wife— I mean,” 
says he, “while he continues here, and that none else shall have anything to 
do with her.” All this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without 
any difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to take any of 
them. But every one of them answered “No.” Some of them said they had 
wives in Spain, and the others did not like women that were not Christians; 
and all together declared that they would not touch one of them, which was 
an instance of such virtue as I have not met with in all my travels. On the 
other hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took them every one a wife— that 
is to say, a temporary wife; and so they set up a new form of living; for the 
Spaniards and Friday’s father lived in my old habitation, which they had 
enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants which were taken in the last 
battle of the savages lived with them; and these carried on the main part of 
the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and assisted them in anything as 
they could, or as they found necessity required. 

But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, ill-matched fel- 
lows should agree about these women, and that two of them should not choose 
the same woman, especially seeing two or three of them were, without com- 
parison, more agreeable than the others: but they took a good w^ay enough 
to prevent quarreling among themselves, for they set the five women by them- 
selves in one of their huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew lots 
among them w ho should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where the 
poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he chose; and it was worth 
observing, that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest 
and oldest of the five, which made mirth enough among the rest; and even the 
Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow considered better than any of them, 
that it was application and business they were to expect assistance in, as much 
as in anything else; and she proved to be the best wife of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and fetched out 
one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon them again, and they 
firmly believed they were now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the 
the English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most 
lamentable crj% and hung about her, and took their leave of her with such 
agonies and affection as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world; 
nor was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to 
be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday’s father, who 
immediately let them know that the five men, who w^ere to fetch them out one 
by one, had chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little over, 
the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them; and in a few 
hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; 
for those they had already were crowded with their tools, household stuff, and 
provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and the two 
honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so that they 



m W6RKS of DANIEL DEFOE 

conmued separated as before; and thus my island was peopled in three places, 
Und/as I might say, three towns were begun to be built. 

And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often happens in the 
world (what the wise ends of God’s providence are, in such a disposition of 
things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two worst wives; and 
the three reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, 
and neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor any one else, had thre^ 
clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious wives; not that the first two were bad 
wives as to their temper and humor, for all the five were most willing, quiet) 
passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning \ 
is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly 
and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honor of a diligent application on 
one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the 
other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the several improvements, 
plantings, and management of the several little colonics, the two men had so 
far outgone the three, that there was no comparison. They had, indeed, both 
of them as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was, 
because, according to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to 
sow more corn than they wanted; but the difference of the cultivation, of 
the planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of everything else, was easy to be 
seen at first view. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts, so 
that when you came to the place, nothing was to be seen but a wood; and 
though they had twice had their plantation demolished, once by their own 
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they 
had restored all again, and everything was thriving and flourishing about them, 
they had grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, though they 
had themselves never seen anything of that kind; and, by their good ordering 
their vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the others. They had also 
found themselves out a retreat in the thickest part of the woods, where, though 
there was not a natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incessant 
labor of their hands, and where, when the mischief which followed happened, 
they secured their wives and children so as they could never be found; they 
having, by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I 
said, grew so readily, made the grove unpassable, except in-sonle places, where 
they climbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on by ways of 
their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they were much 
civilized by their settlement compared to what they were before, and were 
not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity, yet one of the certain 
companions of a profligate mind never left them, and that was their idleness. 
It is true, they planted corn, and made fences; but Solomon’s words were 
never better verified than in them; “1 went by the vineyard of the slothful, 
and it was all overgrown with thorns,” for when the Spaniards came to view 
their crop, they could not see it in some places for weeds; the hedge had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 231 

several gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten up the com; 
perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for the 
present, but it was only shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen: 
whereas, when they looked on the colony of the other two, there was the 
very face of industry and success upon ail they did; there was not a weed to 
be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the other 
hand, verified Solomon’s words m another place, “that the diligent hand maketh 
rich;” for everything grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and with- 
out, they had more tame cattle than the others, more utensils and necessaries 
within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within doors; 
and having learned the English ways of dressing and cooking from one of the 
other Englishmen, who, as 1 said, was a cook’s mate on board the ship, they 
dressed their husbands’ victuals very nicely and well; whereas the others could 
not be brought to understand it; but then the husband, who, as 1 say, had been 
cook’s mate, did it himself. But as for the husbands of the three wives, they 
loitered about, fetched turtles’ eggs, and caught fish and birds; in a word, 
anything but labor; and they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and 
comfortably, and the slothful hard and beggarly; and so, I believe, generally 
speaking, it is all over the world. 

But 1 now come to a scene different from all that had happened before, 
either to them or to me; and the origin of the story was this:— Early one 
morning, there came on shore five or six canoes of Indians or savages, call 
them which you please, and there is no room to doubt they came upon the old 
errand of feeding upon their slaves; but that part was now so familiar to the 
Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, 
as 1 did; but having been made sensible, by their experience, that their only 
business was to lie concealed, and if they were not seen by any of the savages, 
they would go off again quietly, when their business was done, having, as yet, 
not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the island; 1 say, having 
been made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice to all the 
three plantations to keep within doors, and not show themselves, only placing 
a scout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats went to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right;'but a disaster spoiled all these measures, 
and made it known among the savages that there were inhabitants there; 
which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony. After the 
canoes with the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again; and 
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to sec 
what they had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found three 
savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground. It was supposed 
they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they 
were fallen asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they had 
Wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time to be taken m. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a loss 
what to do. The Spanish governor, as it happened, was with them, and his 
advice was asked, but he professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves, they 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


232 

had enough akeady; and as to killing them, they were none of them inclined 
to do that: the Spaniard governor told me, they could not think of shedding 
innocent blood; for as to them, the poor creatures had done them no wrong, 
invaded none of their property, and they thought they had no just quarrel 
against them, to take away their lives. And here I must, in justice to these 
Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and 
Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men of any nation whatr 
soever, in any foreign country, who were so universally modest, temperatet, 
virtuous, so very good-humored, and so courteous, as these Spaniards: and ak 
to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very nature; no inhumanity, n(J 
barbarity, no outrageous passions; and yet all of them men of great courage 
and spirit. Their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the insuf- 
ferable usage of the three Englishmen; and their justice and humanity appeared 
now in the case of the savages as above. After some consultation, they resolved 
upon this: that they would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three 
men might be gone. But then the governor Spaniard recollected that the three 
savages had no boat; and if they \\ ere left to rove about the island, they would 
certainly discover that there w^ere inhabitants in it; and so they should be 
undone that way. Upc^n this, they went back again, and there lay the fellows 
fast asleep still, and so they resolved to awake them, and take them prisoners, 
and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely frightened when they were 
seized upon and bound; and afraid, like the women, that they should be 
murdered and eaten: for it seems, those people think all the world does as 
they do, eating men’s flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that, and 
away they carried them. 

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home to their 
castle, 1 mean to my palace under the hill; but they carried them first to the 
bower, where was the chief of their country work, such as the keeping the 
goats, the planting the corn, &c.; and afterwards they carried them to the 
habitation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for them to 
do; and whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought the 
fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran away, and, 
taking to the woods, they could never hear of him any more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon after in some other 
boats or canoes of savages who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, 
and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off in two days’ time. This 
thought terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without 
good cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe among his comrades, he 
would certainly give them an account that there were people in the island, 
and also how few and weak they were; for this savage, as observed before, had 
licver been told (and it was very happy he had not) how many they were, 
or where they lived; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their 
guns, much less had they shown him any of their other retired places, such as 
the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had made, 
and the like. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 233 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given inteHigence of them 
was, that about two months after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven, 
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island, 
where they never used to come before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, 
at a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, 
where this escaped man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, had 
they been all there, the damage would not have been so much, for not a man 
of them would have escaped; but the case now differed very much, for two 
men to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the happiness to discover 
them about a league off, so that it w^as above an hour before they landed; and 
as they landed a mile from the huts, it was some time before they could come 
at them. Now, having great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first 
thing they did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two of 
the three men whom they brought with the women (who, it seems, proved 
very faithful to them), to lead them, with their two wives, and whatever they 
could carry away with them, to their retired places in the woods, which I have 
spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot, till they 
heard farther. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and that they 
had bent their course directly that way, they opened the fences where the 
milch cows were kept, and drove them all out; leaving their goats to straggle in 
the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might think they were all 
bred wild; but the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and 
gave them an account of it all, for they went directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and goods, they 
sent the other slave they had of the tliree who came with the women, and who 
was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give 
them the alarm, and desire speedy help, and, in the mean time, they took their 
arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated towards the place in the 
wood where their wives were sent; keeping at a distance, yet so that they 
might see, if possible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they could see the little 
army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, and, in a moment 
more, could see all their huts and household stuff flaming up together, to their 
great grief and mortification; for they had a very great loss, to them irretrieva- 
ble, at least for some time. They kept their station for a while, till they found 
the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rummaging 
every way, and every place they could think of, in search of prey; and in 
particular for the people, of whom now it plainly appeared they had intelli- 
gence. 

1 he two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure where they 
because it was likely some of the wild people might come that way, and 
they might come too many together, thought it proper to make another retreat 
about half a mile farther; believing, as it afterwards happened, that the farther 
w^ey strolled, the fewer would be together. 

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown part of the 



2H WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vasdy 
large; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there what 
might offer. They had not stood there long before two of the savages appeared 
running directly that way, as if they already had notice where they stood, and 
were coming up to attack them, and a little way farther they espied three more 
coming after them, and five more beyond them, all coming the same way, 
besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance, running anothejr 
way; for, in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their garn^ 

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand and 
keep their posture, or fly, but, after a veiy short debate with themselves, they 
considered, that if the savages ranged the country thus before help came, they' 
might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost, 
so they resolved to stand them there, and if they were too many to deal with, 
then they would get up to the top of the tree, from w hence they doubted not 
to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, though 
all the savages that were landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should fire 
at the first tw o, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the two and the five that followed would be separated at length they resolved 
to let the first two pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and come 
to attack them. The first two savages confirmed them also in this resolution, by 
turning a little from them towards another part of the wood; but the three, and 
the five after them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they had known the 
Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so straight towards them, they 
resolved to take them in a line as they came, and as they resolved to fire but 
one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all three, for which purpose 
the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into his piece; and 
having a fair loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a 
sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards 
of the tree, so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly saw 
that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped from them; and 
they both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should not 
escape, though they should both fire: so the other stood ready with his piece, 
that if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a second. But 
th€ first was too good a marksman to miss his aim, for as the savages kept near 
one another, a little behind in a line, he fired, and hit two of them directly: the 
foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head; the second, which was 
ijie runaway Indian, was shot through the body, and fell, but was not quite 
dead; and the third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same 
ball that went through the body of the second; and being dreadfully fright- 
ened, though not so much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and 
filing in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than sensible of 
the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made the sound a thousand times 
bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling from one side to another, and the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 235 

fowls rising from all parts, screaming, and every sort making a different noise, 
according to their kind; just as it was when I fired the first gun that perhaps 
was ever shot off in the island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the matter was, 
came on unconcerned till they came to the place where their companions lay 
in a condition miserable enough: and here the poor ignorant creatures, not 
sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief, stood all together 
over the wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how 
he came to be hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, told them, that a 
flash of fire first, and immediately after that thunder from their gods, had 
killed those two and wounded him: this, I say, is rational; for nothing is more 
certain than that, as they saw no man near them, so they had never heard a 
gun in all their lives, nor so much as heard of a gun; neither knew they any- 
thing of killing and wounding at a distance with fire and bullets: if they had, 
one might reasonably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned to 
view the fate of their fellows, without some apprehensions of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved them to be obliged 
to kill so many poor creatures, who, at the same time, had no notion of their 
danger, yet, having them all thus in their power, and the first having loaded 
his piece again, resolved to let fly both together among them; and singling 
out, by agreement, which to aim at, they sht)t together, and killed, or very 
much wounded, four of them; the fifth, frightened even to death, though not 
hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought 
they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come boldly 
out from the tree before they had charged their guns, which was a wrong 
step; and they were under some surprise when they came to the place, and 
found no less than four of them alive, and of them two very little hurt, and 
one not at all: this obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of their 
muskets; and first they made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the 
cause of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put 
them out of their pain: then the man that was not hurt at all came and 
kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous moans 
to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could not say one word to them 
that they could understand. However, they made signs to him to sit down at 
the foot of a tree hard by; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of 
rope twined, which he had by great chance in his pocket, tied his two hands 
behind him, and tliere they left him; and with what speed they could, made 
after the other two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of 
them, should find the way to their covered place in the woods, where their 
wives and the few goods they had left lay. They came once in sight of the two 
tnen, but it was at a great distance; however, they had the satisfaction to sec 
them cross over a valley towards the sea, quite the contrary way from that 
which led to their retreat, which they were afraid of; and being satisfied with 
that, they went back to the tree where they left their prisoner, who, as they 
supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for he was gone, and the two pieces 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


236 

of rope-yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing what course 
to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what number, so they resolved 
to go away to the place where their wives were, to see if all was well there, 
and to make them easy, who were in fright enough, to be sure, for though 
the savages were their own countrymen, yet they were most terribly afr^i(ji 
of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been in the wood, and 
very near that place, but had not found it; for it was indeed inaccessible, frorn 
the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it had been directed 
by those that knew it, which these did not: they found, therefore, everything 
very safe, only the women in a terrible fright. While they were here, they 
had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their assistance, 
the other ten, with their servants, and old Friday (I mean Friday’s father), 
were gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were 
kept there, in case the savages should have roved over to that side of the 
country; but they did not spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came one 
of the three savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly; and with 
them also came the savage whom the Englishmen had left bound hand and 
foot at the tree, for it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the 
seven men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them; where, 
however, they were obliged to bind him again, as they had the two others 
who were left when the third ran away. 

The prisoners now began to be a burden to them; and they were so afraid 
of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them all, believing 
they were under an absolute necessity to do so for their own preservation. 
However, the Spaniard governor would not consent to it, but ordered, for 
the present, that they should be sent out of the way, to my old cave in the 
valley, and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and give them 
food for their subsistence, which was done; and they were bound there, 
hand and foot, for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged, that 
they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there; but taking five of 
the Spaniards and themselves, with four muskets and a pistol among them, 
and two stout quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the savages. And 
first they came to the tree where the men lay that had tieen killed; but it 
was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there, for they had 
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had dragged two of them a 
good way, but had given it ol^er. From thence they advanced to the first 
rising ground, where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where 
they had ,the mortification still to see some of the smoke; but neither could 
rfiey here see any of the savages. They then resolved, though with all possible 
caution, to go forward towards their ruined plantation; but, a little before 
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the 
savages all embarked again in their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed 
sorry at first, that there was no way to come at them, to give them a parting 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 237 

blow; but, upon the whole, they were very well satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their improvements 
destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and assist 
them with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet noted 
for having the least inclination to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of 
it (for they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all was 
over), came and offered their help and assistance, and did, very friendly, 
work for several days to restore their habitation, and make necessaries for 
them. And thus in a little time they were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this they had the further satisfaction of seeing three 
of the savages’ canoes come driving on shore, and, at some distance from them, 
two drowned men, by which they had reason to believe that they had met 
with a storm at sea, which had overset some of them; for it had blown very 
hard the night after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough of them 
escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they had done as of what had 
happened to them, and to whet them on to another enterprise of the same 
nature, which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry 
all before them; for except what the first man had told them of inhabitants, 
they could say little of it of their own knowledge for they never saw one 
man; and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they had no other wit- 
ness to confirm it to them. 

It was five or six months after this before they heard any more of the 
savages, in w^hich time our men were in hopes they had either forgot their 
former bad luck, or given over hopes of better; when, on a sudden, they were 
invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, 
full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, 
and such like engines of war; and they brought such numbers with them, 
that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side of the 
island, our men had that night to consult and consider what to do; and, in 
the first place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was their onl^ 
safety before, and w^ould be much more so now, while the number of their 
enemies would be so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take down 
the huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their 
goats to the old cave; because they supposed the savages would go directly 
tluthcr, as soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though they 
did not now land within two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove away 
all the flocks of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged 
to the Spaniards; and,- in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants any- 
where as was possible; and the next morning early they posted themselves, 
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men, to wait for their com- 
ing. As they guessed, so it happened: these new invaders, leaving their canoes 
at the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore, directly towards 
the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could 
jndge. Our army was but small, indeed; but, that which was worse, they had 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

not arms for all their number neither. The whole account, it seems, stood thus: 
first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday (or Friday’s 
father), the three slaves taken with the women, who proved very faithful, 
and three other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had 
eleven muskets, five pistols, three fowUng-pieces, five muskets or fowling- 
pieces, which were taken by me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced, 
two swords, and three old halberds. i 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee; but they had 
a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron faste^d 
into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also every one of our men had 
a hatchet; two of the women could not be prevailed upon, but they would 
come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniard? 
had taken from the savages when the first action happened, which I have 
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another; and the women had 
hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I described so often, commanded the whole; 
and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a most 
daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The savages came forward like 
lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in 
their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, 
with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced 
guard, with orders to let the first of them pass by, and then fire into the 
middle of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as nimbly 
as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards, 
where they stood, having a thicket of trees before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in heaps, 
out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass by 
him; then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he orders three of his 
men to fire, having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, 
about as big as large pistol bullets. How many they killed or wounded they 
knew not, but the consternation and surprise were inexpressible among the 
savages; thej^ were frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise, 
and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, 
in the middle of their fright. Will Atkins and his other three let fly again 
among the thickest of them; and in less than a minute, the first three being 
loaded again, gave them a third volley. _ ^ 

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they had fired, 
as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body been at hand, to have 
poured in their shot continually, the savages had been effectually routed; for 
the terror that was among them came principally from this, that they were 
killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that 
hurt them; but Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat: some 
of the savages who were at a distance spying them, came upon them behind; 
and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or three times, and 
Idlled above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet thej^ wounded Atkins 
himself, and killed one of his fellow-Englishmen with their arrows, as they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 239 

did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who came with 
the women. This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, 
killing five of them with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the 
armed staves and a hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other men killed, 
retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, after foing three 
volleys upon them, retreated also; for their number was so great, and they 
were so desperate, that though above fifty of them were killed, and more than 
as many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, 
and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed that their wounded 
men, who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds, 
and fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the Englishman that 
were lulled behind them; and the savages, when they came up to them, killed 
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, 
with their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages; but finding our men 
were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a 
ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in token or their 
victory; after which, they had the mortification to see several of their wounded 
men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon a 
rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have had them march 
and charge again all together at once: but the Spaniard replied, “Seignior 
Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight, let them alone till morning; 
all the wounded men will be stiff and sore with their wounds, and faint 
vith the loss of blood; and so we shall have the fewer to engage.” This advice 
was good: but Will Atkins replied merrily, “That is true, seignior, and so 
shall I too; and that is the reason I would go on while I am warm.” “Well, 
Seignior Atkins,” says the Spaniard, “you have behaved gallantly, and done 
your part; we will fight for you if you cannot come on; but I think it best 
to stay till morning:” so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages in great 
disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great noise and hurry 
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon them 
in the night; especially if they could come to give them but one volley before 
they were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity to do: for one of 
the Englishmen in whose quarter it was where the fight began, led them 
round between the woods and the sea-side westward, and then turning short 
south, they came so near where the thickest of them lay, that, before they 
were seen or heard, eight of them fired in upon them, and did dreadful execu- 
tion upon them; in half a minute more, eight others fired after them, pouring 
in their small shot in such a quantity, that abundance were killed and wounded; 
^d all this while they were not able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then divided 
Aemselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all together. 
They had in each body eight persons, that is to say, twenty-two men, and the 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


240 

two women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They divided the fire- 
arms equally in each party, as well as the halberds and staves. They would 
have had the women kept back, but they said they were resolved to die with 
their husbands. Having thus formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing 
as loud as they could; the savages stood all together, but were in the utmost 
confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters togethef: 
they would have fought if they had seen us; for as soon as we came nealr 
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded^ 
though not dangerously; but our men gave them no time, but, running up to 
them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt ends of 
their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and laid about 
them so well, that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling, 
flying to save their lives which way soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally wounded 
in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them; the rest, being fright- 
ened out of their wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills, with 
all the speed fear and nimble feet could help them to; and as wc did not 
trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together to the sea-side 
where they landed, and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at 
an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the sea, 
so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the storm continuing all 
night, when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven by the 
surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it required infinite toil to get 
them off; and some of them were even dashed to pieces against the beach, 
or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that night; but 
having refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolved to march 
to that part of the island where the savages were fled, and see what posture 
they were in. This necessarily led them over the place where the fight had 
been, and where they found several of the poor creatures not quite dead, 
and yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds, 
for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his 
enemy, takes no delight in his misery. However, there was no need to give 
any orders in this case; for their own savages, who were their servants, 
despatched these poor creatures with their hatchets. 

At length, they came in view of the place where the more miserable remains 
of the savages’ army lay, where they appeared about a hundred still; their 
posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards 
their mouth, and the head put between the two hands, leaning down upon 
the knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shots of them, the Spaniard gov- 
Cfnor ordered two muskets to be fired, without ball, to alarm them: this he 
'did? that by their countenance he might know what to expect, whether they 
still in heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and 
,dis(C(lyraged, and so he might manage accordingly. This stratagem took; for 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 241 

as soon as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second, 
they started up upon their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable; and 
as our men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and yelling 
away, with a kind of howling noise, which our men did not understand, and 
had never heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and they 
had all gone away to sea; but they did not then consider that this might 
probably have been the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes 
as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many and so often, as would 
quite desolate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, not- 
withstanding his wound, kept always with them, proved the best counsellor 
ill this case: his advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and step in 
between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever 
returning any more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this; and some were against it for fear of making 
the wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate, and so they should 
have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, 
and have their plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, 
in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred men than 
with a hundred nations; that as they must destroy their boats, so they must de- 
stroy the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed 
them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to 
work immediately with the boats, and getting some dry wood together from a 
dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire, but they were so wet that 
they would not burn; however, the fire so burnt the upper part, that it soon 
made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw 
what they were about, some of them came running out of the woods, and 
coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down and cried, “Oa, Oa, 
Waramokoa,” and some other words of their language, which none of the 
others understood anything of; but as they made pitiful gestures and strange 
noises, it was easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared, and 
that they would be gone, and never come there again. But our men were 
now satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, or to save their 
colony, but effectually to prevent any of these people from ever going home 
again, depending upon this, that if even so much as one of them got back into 
their country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that, letting them 
know that they should not have any mercy, they fell to work with their 
canoes, and destroyed every one that the storm had not destroyed before; 
at the sight of which, the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our 
people heard plain enough, after which they ran about the island like dis- 
tracted men, so that, in a word, our men did not really know what at first 
to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider 
that while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have kept 
^ good guard at the same time upon their plantations; for though, it is true, 
'^hey had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main 



242 ' WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

retreat (I mean my old casde at the hill), nor the cave in the valley, yet they 
found out my plantaaon at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the 
fences and planting about it, trod all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and 
grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage, 
though to themselves not one farthing’s worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they were 
in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down, for as they weife 
too nimble of foot for our men when they found them single, so our men 
durst not go abroad single, for fear of being surrounded with their numbers 
The best was, they had no weapons; for though they had bows, they had no 
arrows left, nor any materials to make any; nor had they any edge-tool or 
weapon among them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and indeed 
deplorable; but, at the same time, our men were also brought to very bad 
circumstances by them, for though their retreats were preserved, yet their 
provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled, and what to do, or which 
way to turn themselves they knew not. The only refuge they had now, was 
the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn 
which grew there, and the plantation of the three Englishmen, Will Atkins 
and his comrades, who were now reduced to two, one of them being killed 
by an arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the temple, 
so that he never spoke more, and it was very remarkable that this was the 
same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet, and 
who afterwards intended to have murdered the Spaniards. 

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time, than mine was 
at any time after I first discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got into 
the manner of planting and raising my corn, and my tame cattle, for now 
they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour 
everything they could come at, yet could be hardly come at themselves. 

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing they con- 
cluded was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the farther part of 
the island, south-west, that if any more savages came on shore they might 
not find one another; then, that they would daily hunt and harass them, and 
kill as many of them as they could come at, till they had reduced their number, 
and if they could at last tame them, and bring them to anything, they would 
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live upon their daily labor. 

In order to do this, they so followed them, and so terrified them with their 
guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did 
not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear; and so dreadfully frightened 
they were that they kept out of sight farther and farther; till, at last, our 
^ men following them, and almost every day killing or wounding some of them, 
they kept up in the woods or hollow places so much, that it reduced them 
to the utmost misery for want of food, and many were afterwards found 
d^sad in the woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity moved them, 
especially the Spaniard governor, who was the most gendeman-like, generous* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 243 

minded man that I Svcr met with in my life; and he proposed, if possible, to 
rake one of them alive, and bring him to understand what they meant, so 
far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go among them, and see if they 
might be brought to some conditions that might be depended upon, to save 
their lives and do us no harm. 

It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being weak 
and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised and made a prisoner. He 
was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; but finding himsSelf kindly 
used, and victuals given to him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew 
tractable, and came to himself. They brought old Friday to him, who talked 
often with him, and told him how kind the others would be to them all; that 
they would not only save their lives, but give them part of the island to live 
in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in their own 
bounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that they 
should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for their bread, and 
some bread given them for their present subsistence, and old Friday bade the 
fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they said 
to it, assuring them that, if they did not agree immediately, they should be 
all destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to about 
thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer, and begged to haye 
some food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, 
veil armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to the place 
where they were. The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of 
bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats; 
and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate 
their provisions very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows to their 
words that could be thought of; for, except when they came to beg victuals 
and directions, they never came out of their bounds; and there they Eyed 
when I came to the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them both to plant com, make bread, breed tame goats, 
and milk them: they wanted nothing but wives, and they soon would have 
been a nation. They were confined to a neck of land, surrounded with high 
rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the sea before them, on the 
south-east corner of the island. They had land enough, and it was very good 
and fruitful; about a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles in lei^h. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made for myself, 
and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four knives; and there 
they lived, the most subjected, iimocent creatures that ever were heard of. 

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity, with respect to the 
savages, till I came to revisit them, which was about two years after; not but 
that, now and then, some canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal, 
unnatural feasts; but as they were of several nations, and perhaps had never 
heard of those that came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any 
^arch or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it would have been 
very hard to have found them out. 



244 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that happened to them till 
my return, at least, what was worth notice. The Indians or savages were 
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently went among them; but 
forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians coming to them, because they 
would not have their settlement betrayed again. One thing was very remark- 
able, viz.: that they taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but 
they soon outdid their masters; for they made abundance of most ingenioiis 
things in wicker-work, particularly of all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, 
cupboards, &c.; as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of 
other things, being very ingenious at such work, when they were once put 
in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we furnished 
them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that 
kind which they could want. With the help of those tools, they were so very 
handy that they came at last to build up their huts, or houses, very hand- 
somely, raddling or working it up like basket-work all the way round; which 
was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was 
an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin, 
and our men were so taken with it, that they got the wild savages to come and 
do the like for them; so that when I came to see the two Englishmen’s colonies, 
they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in a hive. As for Will 
Atkins, who was now become a \ery industrious, useful, and sober fellow, 
he had made himself such a tent of basket-work as, I believe, was never seen, 
it was one hundred and twenty paces round on the outside, as I measured by 
my steps; the walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares 
of thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet high; in 
the middle was another not above twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, 
being octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood eight very strong 
posts; round the top of which he laid strong pieces, pinned together with 
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for a roof of eight rafters, very 
handsome, I assure you, and joined together very well, though he had no nails, 
and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself too, out of the old iron 
that I had left there; and, indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity 
in several things which he had no knowledge of: he made him a forge, with 
a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for his 
work; and he formed out of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer 
upon: in this manner he made many things, but especially hooks, staples, spikes, 
bolts, and hinges. But to return to the house: after he had pitched the roof 
of his innermost tent, he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work, 
$o firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over 
that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry 
as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed, he owned that the savages had made 
the basket-work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, all 
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-two angles 
to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty feet distant, so that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 245 

there was a space like a walk within the outer wicker-wall and without the 
inner near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, but much 
fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had six rooms on a floor, 
and out of every one of these there was a door; first, into the entry, or com- 
ing into the main tent, and another door into the space or walk that was 
round it; so that walk was also divided into six equal parts, which served not 
only for a retreat, but to store up any necessaries which the family had occa- 
sion for. These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other 
apartments the outer circle had wxre thus ordered: As soon as you were in 
at the door of the outer circle, you had a short passage straight before you 
to the door of the inner house; but on either side was a wicker partition, and 
a door in it, by which you went first into a large room, or storehouse, twenty 
feet wide and about thirty feet long, and through that into another not quite 
so long; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which 
were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and served 
as closets or retiring-rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle; 
and four large warehouses, or barns, or what you please to call them, which 
went through one another, two on either hand of the passage, that led 
through the outer door to the inner tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the world, nor a 
house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. In this great bee-hive 
lived the three families, that is to say, Will Atkins and his companion; the 
third was killed, but his wife remained with three children, for she was, it 
seems, big with child when he died; and the other two wxre not at all back- 
ward to give the w idow her full share of everything, I mean as to their corn, 
milk, grapes, &c., and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; 
so that they all lived well enough; though it was true, they w^ere not so 
industrious as the other two, as has been observed already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz.: that as for religion, I do not 
know' that there w'as anything of that kind among them; they often, indeed, 
put one another in mind that there was a God, by the very common method 
of seamen, swearing by his name; nor were their poor ignorant savage wives 
much better for having been married to Christians, as we must call them; for 
as they knew very little of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of 
entering into any discourse with their wives about a God, or to talk anything 
to them concerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives had made 
Irom them w as, that they had taught them to speak English pretty well; and 
most of their children, who were near twenty in all, were taught to speak 
English too, from their first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it 
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There was none of these children 
above six years old when I came thither, for it was not much above seven 
years since they had fetched these five savage ladies over; but they had all 
been pretty fruitful, for they had all children, more or less: I think the cook’s 



246 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

mate’s wife was big of her sixth child; and the mothers were all a good sort 
of well-governed, quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one 
another, mighty observant and subject to their masters (I cannot call them 
husbands), and wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian 
religion, and to be legally married; both which were happily brought about 
afterwards by my means, or at least in consequence of my coming among them 

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and pretty mu|:h 
of my runagate English, I must say something of the Spaniards, who were 
the main body of the family, and in whose story there are some incidents al^ 
remarkable enough. \ 

I had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances when 
they were among the savages. They told me readily that they had no instances 
to give of their application or ingenuity in that country; that they were a 
poor, miserable, dejected handful of people; that if means had been put into 
their hands, yet they had so abandoned themselves to despair, and so sunk 
under the weight of their misfortune, that they thought of nothing but starv- 
ing, One of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was convinced they 
were in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give themselves 
up to their misery, but always to take hold of the helps which reason ojfifered, 
as well for present support as for future deliverance- he told me that grief 
was the most senseless, insignificant passion in the world, for that it regarded 
only things past, which were generally impossible to be recalled, or to be 
remedied, but had no views of things to come, and had no share in anything 
that looked like deliverance, but rather added to the affliction than proposed a 
remedy; and upon this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot 
repeat in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it into 
an English proverb of my own, thus:— 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements 1 had made 
in my solitude, my unwearied application, as he called it, and how I had 
made a condition, which in its circumstances was at first much worse than 
theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs was, even now when they were 
all together. He told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater 
presence of mind, in their distress, than any people that ever he met with; that 
their unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world 
to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first step in dangers, after the 
common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and die, without 
rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that they were cast 
Upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of food, or present suste- 
tiance till they could provide for it; that, it was true, 1 had this disadvantage 
and discomfort, that 1 was alone; but then the supplies I had providentially 
thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, 
was such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to have

applied himself as I had dofte. “Seignior,*^ says the Spaniard, “had we poor 
Spaniards been in yoi^ case, we should never have got half those things out 
of the ship, as you did: nay,” says he, “we should never have found means 
to have got the raft on shore without boat or sail; and how much less should 
we have done if any of us had been alone!” Well, 1 desired him to abate his 
compliments, and go on with the history of their coming on shore, where they 
landed. He told me they unhappily landed at a place where there were 
without provisions; whereas, had they had the common sense to put off to 
sea again, and gone to another island a little farther, they had found provisions, 
though without people; there being an island that way, as they had been told, 
where there were provisions, though no people; that is to say, that the Span- 
iards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and had filled the island with 
goats and hogs at several times, where they had bred in such multitudes, and 
where turtle and sea-fowls were in such plenty, that they could have been 
in no want of flesh, though they had found no bread, whereas, here they were 
only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they understood not, and 
which had no substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave them sparingly 
enough; and they could treat them no better, unless they would turn can- 
nibals, and eat men’s flesh, which was the great dainty of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize the savages 
they were with, and to teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of 
living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon them, as unjust, that they, 
who came there for assistance and support, should attempt to set up for in- 
structors of those that gave them food, intimating, it seems, that none should 
set up for the instructors of others but those who could live without them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to; how 
sometimes they were many days without any food at all, the island they were 
upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent, and for 
that reason were less supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had 
^reason to believe others were in the same part of the world: and yet they 
; found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious than those who had 
better supplies of food. Also they added, they could not but see with what 
demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of God 
directs the events of things in this world; which, they said, appeared in their 
circumstances, for if, pressed by the hardships they were under, and the bar- 
renness of the country where they were, they had searched after a better to 
live in, they had been out of the way of the relief that happened to them 
l>y my means. 

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived among 
expected them to go out with them into their wars; and it was true, that 
as they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the disaster to lose their 
ammunition, they could have been serviceable not only to their friends, but 
have made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies; but being without 
powder and shot, and yet in a condition that they could not in reason deny 
go out with their landlords to their wars, so when they came into the 
field of battle, they were in a worse condition than the savages themselves, 



248

for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages 
gave them; so they could do nothing but stand still and be wounded with 
arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their enemy; and then, indeed, the 
three halberds they had were of use to them; and they would often drive a 
whole little army before them with those halberds, and sharpened sticks put 
into the muzzles of their muskets: but that, for all this, they were sometimes 
surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at I^st 
they found the way to make themselves large targets of wood, which th<^ 
covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and the^ 
covered them from the arrows of the savages: that, notwithstanding these^ 
they were sometimes in great danger; and five of them were once knocked 
down together with the clubs of the savages, which was the time when one 
of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom I relieved: that 
at first they thought he had been killed; but when they afterwards heard he 
was taken prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and would 
willingly have aU ventured their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of their 
company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were come to 
themselves, all but him who they thought had been dead; and then they made 
their way with their halberds and pieces, standing close together in a line, 
through a body of above a thousand savages, beating down all that came in 
their way, got the victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, be- 
cause it was with the loss of their friend, whom the other party, finding alive, 
carried off, with some others, as I gave an account before. 

They described, most affectionately, how they were surprised with ]oy at 
the return of their friend and companion in misery, who they thought had 
been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind— wild men; and yet, how more 
and more they were surprised with the account he gave them of his errand, 
and that there was a Christian in any place near, much more one that was able, 
and had humanity enough, to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief I sent 
them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread— things they had not seen 
since their coming to that miserable place; how often they crossed it and 
blessed it as bread sent from Heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to 
their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent^for their supply^ 
and, after all, they would have told me something of the joy they were in at 
the sight of a boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from 
whence all these new comforts came; but it was impossible to express it by 
words, for their excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming extrava- 
gances, they had no way to describe them, but by telling me they bordered 
upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their passions suitable to the sense 
that was upon them; that in some it worked one way, and in some another; 
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others 
be stark mad, and others immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected 
me, and called to my mind Friday’s ecstasy when he met his father, and the 
poor people’s ecstasy when I took them up at sea after their ship was on firc» 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


249 

the joy of the mate of the ship when he found himself delivered in the place 
where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when, after twenty-eight 
years’ captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country. 
All these things made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men, 
and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them, I must 
relate the heads of what I did for these people, and the condition in which I 
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be troubled no 
more with the savages, or if they were, they would be able to cut them off, 
if they were twice as many as before; so they had no concern about that. 
Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call gov- 
ernor, about their stay in the island; for as I was not come to carry any of 
them off, so it would not be just to carry off some and leave others, who, 
perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished. On the 
other hand, I told them I came to establish them there, not to remove them; 
and then I let them know that I had brought with me relief of sundry kind 
for them; that 1 had been at a great charge to supply them with all things 
necessary, as well for their convenience as their defence; and that I had such 
and such particular persons with me, as 'well to increase and recruit their 
number, as by the particular necessary employments which they were bred 
to, being artificers, to assist them in those things in which at present they 
were in want. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I delivered 
to them the stores I had brought, 1 asked them, one by one, if they had 
entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had been among them, 
and would shake hands with one another, and engage in a strict friendship 
and union of interest, that so there might be no more misunderstandings and 
jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humor, said they had 
met with affliction enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough to 
make them all friends; that, for his part, he would live and die with them, and 
was so far from designing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned they 
had done nothing to him but what his own mad humor made necessary, and 
what he would have done, and perhaps worse, in their case; and that he would 
ask them pardon, if 1 desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had 
done to them, and was very willing and desirous of living in terms of entire 
friendship and union with them, and would do anything that lay in his 
power to convince them of it; and as for going to England, he cared not if 
he did not go thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and excluded Will 
Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct, as they had let me know, 
and they appealed to me for the necessity they were under to do so; but 
that Will Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had 
with the savages, and on several occasions since, and had showed himself 
so faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of them all, that they 
had forgotten all that was passed, and thought he merited as much to be 



!250 WORKS OP DANIEL DEFOE 

trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them; and they 
had testified their satisfaction in him, by committing the command to hiii 
next to the governor himself; and as they had entire confidence in him and 
all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence 
by all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted; and 
they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance, that 
they would never have any interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship we appointed the ^lext 
day to dine all together; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I caused \the 
ship’s cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old 
cook’s mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of 
good beef and four pieces of pork, out of the ship’s provisions, with oUr 
punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles 
of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer; things that neither the 
Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and which it may be 
supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to our feast five whole 
kids, which the cooks roasted, and three of them were sent, covered up close, 
on board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresli meat from on 
shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board. 

After this feast, at which we were innocently merry, I brought my cargo 
of goods; wherein, that there might be no dispute about dividing, 1 showed 
them that there was a sufficiency for them all, desiring that they might all 
take an equal quantity of the goods that were for wearing; that is to say, 
equal when made up. As, first I distributed linen sufficient to make every one 
or them four shirts, and, at the Spaniard’s request, afterwards made them 
up six; these were exceeding comfortable to them, having been what the} 
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them. I allotted the 
thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make every one a light coat, 
like a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose, 
and ordered that whenever they decayed, they should make more, as they 
thought fit; the like for pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &c. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat upon the countenances 
of all these poor men, when they saw the care I had taken of them, and how 
well I had furnished them. They told me I was a father to them; and that 
having such a correspondent as I was in so remote a part of the world, it 
would make them forget that they were left in a desolate place; and they all 
voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place without my consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, particularly 
the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them most necessary peoj?le, 
but, above all, my general artificer, than whom they could not name anything 
that was more useful to them; and the tailor, to show his concern for them, 
went to work immediately, and with my leave, made them every one a shirt, 
fihe iirst thing he did; and, what was still more, he taught the women not 
only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them assist to make 
ijte shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest. 

M to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were; for they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 25t 

ook to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made clever convenient 
ables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and everything they 
vanted of that kind. But to let them see how nature made artificers at first, 

carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins’ basket house, as I called it; and 
hey both owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before, 
lor anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind; and one 
)f them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning about to me* 
‘1 am sure,” says he, “that man has no need of us; you need do nothing but 
rive him tools.” 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man a 
iigging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows or plough; and 
:o every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw; always 
appointing, that as often as any were broken or worn out, they should be 
supplied without grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind. Nails, 
staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of iron-work, 
they had without reserve, as they required; for no man would take more 
than he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any 
account whatever; and for the use of the smith, I left r^vo tons of unwrought 
iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which 1 brought them, was such, even 
to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now they could 
march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if there was occa- 
sion; and were able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little 
advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, if they had occasion. 

1 carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved to 
death, and the maid also: she was a sober, well-educated, religious young 
voman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one gave her a good word; 
she had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the ship 
but herself, but she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing things so well 
ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that 
they had neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason for 
taking so long a voyage, both of them came to me, and desired I would give 
them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among my family, as they 
called it. 1 agreed to this readily; and they had a little plot of ground allotted 
to them, where they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded with a 
basket work, palisaded like Atkins’, adjoining to his plantation. Their tents 
^^cre contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to lodge in, and 
a middle tent like a great storehouse, to lay their goods in, and to eat 
and drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their habita- 
tion to the same place; and so the island was divided into three colonies, and 
no more, viz.: the Spaniards, with old Friday and the first servants, at my old 
habitation under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and where 
they had so enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on the out- 
of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. 
Never was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of tne 
^orld; for I verily believe, that a thousand men might have ranged the island 



252 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

a month, and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on 
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the trees stood so thick and 
so close, and grew so fast woven, one into another, that nothing but cutting 
them down first could discover the place, except the only two narrow en- 
trances where they went in and out could be found, which was not very easy; 
one of them was close down at the water’s edge, on the side of the creek, and 
it was afterwards above two hundred yards to the place; and the other was up 
a ladder at twice, as 1 have already described it; and they had also a large w<^od, 
thickly planted, on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, which gtew 
apace, and concealed the place from all discovery there, with only one narrpw 
place between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to enter on that side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four families 
of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their wives and children, 
three savages that were slaves, the widow and the children of the Englishman 
that was killed, the young man and the maid, and, by the way, we made a wife 
of her before we went away. There were also the two carpenters and the 
tailor, whom I brought with me for them; also the smith, who was a very 
necessary man to them, especially as a grmsmith, to take care of their arms; 
and my other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as 
good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, 
but a very merry fellow, and before I went away we married him to the 
honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say something 
of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out of the ship’s crew 
whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a Roman, and perhaps it may 
give offence to some hereafter, if I leave anything extraordinary upoa record 
of a man whom, before I begin, I must (to set him out in just colors) repre- 
sent in terms very much to his disadvantage, in the account of Protestants; as, 
first, that he was a Papish; secondly, a Popish priest; and, thirdly, a French 
Popist priest. But justice demands of me to give him a due character; and I 
must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person; exact in 
his life, extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost everything he did. 
What then can any one say against being very sensible of the value of such a 
man, notwithstanding his profession? though it may be my opinion, perhaps, 
as well as the opinion of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him ^fter he had agreed to 
go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his 
conversation; and he first began with me about religion in the most obliging ; 
manner imaginable. ‘‘Sir,” says he, “you have not only under God (and at that i 
he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have admitted me to this voyage 
in your ship, and by your obliging civility, have taken me into your familyi 
giving me an opportunity of free conversation. Now, sir, you see by my habit 
what my profession is, and 1 guess by your nation what yours is; 1 may think 
it is my duty— and doubtless it is so— to use my utmost endeavors, on all occa- 
sions, to bring all the souls I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace 
the Clatholic doctrine: but as I am here under your permission, and in yon? 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 2SS 

family, I amt)ound in justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and good 
manners, to be under your government; and therefore I shall not, wiuiout 
your leave, enter into any debate on the points of religion in which we may 
not agree, farther than you shall give me leave.” 

1 told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but acknowledge it; 
that it was true we were such people as they called heretics, but that he was 
not the first Catholic I had conversed with, without falling into inconveniences, 
or carrying the questions to any height in debate; that he should not find 
himself the worse used for being of a different opinion from us, and if we 
did not converse without any dislike on either side it should be his fault, 
not ours. 

He replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily separated 
from disputes; that it was not his business to cap principles with every man 
he conversed with; and that he rather desired me to converse with him as a 
gentleman than as a religionist; and that if I would give him leave at any time 
to discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with it, and 
that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own opinions ^ 
as well as he could; but that, without my leave, he would not break in upon ^ 
me with any such thing. He told me further, that he would not cease to do 
all that became him, in his office as a priest, as well as a private Christian, to 
procure the good of the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and though, 
perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not pray with us, he 
hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In this 
manner we conversed; and as he was of the most obliging, gentleman-like 
behavior, so he was, if 1 may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and 
as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many extraor- 
dinary events of it; of many adventures which had befallen him in the few 
years that he had been abroad in the world; and particularly it was very 
remarkable, that in the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the misfortune 
to be five times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the place wliither 
any of the ships he was in at first designed; that his first intent was to have 
gone to Martinico, and that he v'ent on board a ship bound thither at St* Malo; 
but, being forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship received some dam- 
age by running aground in the mouth of the River Tagus, and was obliged 
to unload her cargo there; but finding a Portuguese ship there bound to the 
Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet with a 
'Vessel there bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order to sail to the 
Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship, being but an indifferent 
mariner, had been out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fyal; where, how- 
ever, he happened to find a very good market for his cargo, which was corn, 
^nd therefore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the Isle 
May, and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in this exigence 
but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far as the Banks (so 
^bey call the place where they catch the fish), where meeting with a French 
ship bound from France to Quebec, in the River of Canada, and from thence 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


2S4 

to Martinico, to carry provisions, he thought he should have an opportunity 
to complete his first design; but when he came to Quebec, the master of the 
ship died, and the vessel proceeded no farther; so the next voyage he shipped 
himself for France, in the ship that was burnt when we took them up at sea, 
and then shipped with us for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he 
had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one voyage, 
besides what I shall have occasion to mention farther of him. , 

But I shall not make digression into other men’s stories, which have no i;ela- 
tion to my own: I return to what concerns our affairs in the island. He camh to 
me one morning (for he lodged among us all the while we were upon\he 
island), and it happened to be just when I was going to visit the Englishmeh’s 
colony, at the farthest part of the island; I say, he came to me, and told n\e, 
with a very grave countenance, that he had for two or three days desired an 
opportunity of some discourse with me, which he hoped would not be dis- 
pleasing to me, because he thought it might in some measure correspond with 
my general design which was the prosperity of my new colony, and perhaps 
might put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, in the way of God’s 
blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse, and turned a little 
short, “How, sir,” said I, “can it be said that we are not in the way of God’s 
blessing, after such visible assistances and deliverances as we have seen here, 
and of which I have given you a large account? ” “If you had pleased, sir,” said 
he, with a world of modesty, and yet great readiness, “to have heard me, you 
would have found no room to have been displeased, much less to think so hard 
of me, that 1 should suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and 
deliverances; and I hope, on your behalf, that ) ou are in the way of God's 
blessing, and your design is exceeding good, and will prosper: but, sir, though 
it were more so than is even possible to you, yet there may be some among 
you that are not equally right in their actions; and you know, that in the story 
of the children of Israel one Achan in the camp removed God’s blessing from 
them, and turned his hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them, though 
not concerned in the crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and bore 
the weight of that punishment.” • 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his inference was so 
just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its 
own nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted Ifim, and begged him to 
go on; and, in the mean time, because it seemed that what we had both to say 
might take up some time, I told him I was going to the Englishmen’s planta- 
tions, and asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the way. 
He told me he would the more willingly wait on me thither, because there 
partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me about; so we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he had 
to say. 

*TYhy, then, sir,” says he, “be pleased to give me leave to lay down a few 
propositions, as the foundation of what I have to say, that we may not 
m the general principles, though we may be of some differing opinions in the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 2S5 

practice of particulars. First, sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal 
articles of religion (and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in the case before 
us, as I shall show afterwards), yet there are some general principles in 
which we both agree— that there is a God; and that this God having given us 
some stated general rules for our service and obedience, we ought not willingly 
anti knowingly to offend Him, either by neglecting to do what He has com- 
manded, or by doing what He has expressly forbidden. And let our different 
religions be what they will, this general principle is readily owned by us all, 
that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous sinning 
against His command; and every good Christian will be affectionately con- 
cmicd to prevent any that arc under his care living in a total neglect of God 
and His commands. It is not your men being Protestants, whatever my opinion 
may be of such, that discharges me from being concerned for their souls, and 
from endeavoring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as little distance 
from, and enmity with, their Maker as possible, especially if you give me leave 
to meddle so far in your circuit.” 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I granted all he had 
said, and thanked him that he would so far concern hinjself for us; and begged 
he would explain the particulars of what he had observed, that like Joshua, 
to take his own parable, 1 might put away the accursed thing from us. 

“Why, then, sir,” says he, “I will take the liberty you give me; and there 
are three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the way of God’s blessing 
upon your endeavors here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake and their 
own, to see removed. And, sir, I promise myself that you vill fully agree with 
me in them all, as soon as 1 name them; especially, because I shall convince you 
that every one of them may, with great ease and very much to your satisfac- 
tion, be remedied. First, sir,” says he, “you have here four Englishmen, who 
have fetched women from among the savages, and have taken them as their 
wives, and have had many children by them all, and yet are not married 
to them after any stated legal manner, as the laws of God and man require; 
and therefore arc yet, in the sense of both, no less than fornicators, it not 
living in adultery. To this, sir, I know you will object that there was no clergy- 
man or priest of any kind, or any profession, to perform the ceremony; nor 
any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have it 
signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has 
told you; I mean, of the agreement that he obliged them to make when they 
took those women, viz.: that they should choose them out by consent, and 
keep separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no 
agreement with the women, as wives, but only an agreement among them- 
selves, to keep them from quarrelling. But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of 
matrimony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual 
consent of the parties to take one another as man and wife, but in the formal 
and legal obligation that there is in the contract, to compel the man ^nd woman, 
all times, to own and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to abstain 
from all other women, to engage in no other contract while these subsist; and, 
on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them and their chil- 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


m 

and to oblige the women to the same or like conditions, mutatis mutondh^ 
on their side. Now, sir,” says he, ‘‘these men may, when they please, or when 
occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their children, leave them 
to perish, and take other women, and marry them while these are living;” and 
here he added, wjth some warmth, “How, sir, is God honored in this unlawful 
liberty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavors in this place, how- 
ever good in themselves, and however sincere in your design, while these tijien, 
who at present are your subjects, under your absolute government and don^in- 
ion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery?” ^ 

1 confess 1 was struck with the thing itself, but much more with the convii^c- 
ing arguments he supported it with; for it was certainly true that, though they 
had no clergymen upon the spot, yet a formal contract on both sides, made 
before witnesses, and confirmed by any token which they had all agreed to ht 
bound by, though it had been but breaking a stick between them, engaging 
the men to own these women for their wives upon all occasions, and never 
to abandon them or their children, and the women to the same with their hus- 
bands, had been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God; and it was 
a great neglect that it was not done. But 1 thought to have got off my young 
priest by telling him that all that part was done when I was not there; and that 
they had lived so many years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was 
past remedy; nothing could be done in it now. 

“Sir,” says he, “asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right in this, 
that, it being done in your absence, you could not be charged with that part 
•of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are not, there- 
fore, under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an end to it. How can 
you think but that, let the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for the 
future, will lie entirely upon you? because it is certainly in your power now 
to put an end to it, and in nobody’s power but yours.” 

I was so dull still that I did not understand him right; but I imagined that, 
by putting an end to it, he meant that I should part them, and not suffer them 
to live together any longer; and I said to him I could not do that by any means, 
for that would put the whole island into confusion. He seemed surprised that 
I should so far mistake him. “No, sir,” said he, “I do not mean that you should 
now separate them, but legally and effectually marry them; and as, sir, iny 
way of marrying them may not be easy to reconcile them to, though it will 
be effectual, even by your own laws, so your way may ^ be as well before 
God, and as valid among men. I mean by a written contract, signed by both 
man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws of Europe 
would decree to be valid.” 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity of zeal, be- 
sides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own party or church, 
such true warmth for preserving the people, that he had no knowledge 
relation to; I say, for preserving them from transgressing the laws of 
-lESoiS, the like of which I had, indeed, not met with anywhere. But recollecting 
he had said of marrying them by a written contract, which I knew he 
stand to, I returned it back upon him, and told him I granted all that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 257 

he had said to be just, aud on his part very kind; that I would discourse with 
the luen upon the point now, when I came to them; and I knew no reason 
why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which 1 knew well enough 
would be granted to be as authentic and valid in England as if they were 
married by one of our own clergymen. What was afterwards done in this 
niatter, I shall speak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he had 
to make, acknowledging that I was very much his debtor for the first, and 
thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would use the same freedom and 
plainness in the second, and hoped T would take it as well; and this was, that, 
notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived 
with these women almost seven years, had taught them to speak English, and 
even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable under-* 
standing, and capable of instruction, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them 
anything of the Christian religion— no, not so much as to know that there was 
a God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to be served, or that their 
own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. 
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and what CJod would certainly 
call them to account for, and perhaps at length take the work out of their 
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warmly. “I am persuaded,” says 
he, “had those men lived in the savage country whence their wives came, the 
savages would have taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters, 
and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so far as I can see, have taken 
with them to teach them the knowledge of the true God. Now, sir,” said he, 
“though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we would be 
glad to see the devil’s servants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to know 
the general principles of the Christian religion; that they might, at least, hear 
of God and a Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a future state— things 
which we all believe; that they might, at least, be so much nearer coming into 
the bosom of the true church than they are now in the public profession of 
idolatry and devil-worship.” 

I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms, and embraced him with an. 
excess of passion. “How far,” said I to him, “have I been from understanding 
the most essential part of a Christian, viz.: to love the interests of the Christian 
church, and the good of other men’s souls! 1 scarce have known what belongs 
to the being a Christian.” “O, sir! do not say so,” replied he; “this thing is not 
your fault ” “No,” said I; “but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you?” 
“It is not too late yet,” said he; “be not too forward to condemn yourself.” 
“But what can be done now?” said I: “you see I am going away.” “Will you 
give me leave to talk with these poor men about it?” “Yes, with all my heart,” 
5‘aid I; “and will oblige them to give heed to what you say, too.” “As to that^” 
said he, “we must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is your business 
to assist them, encourage them, and instruct them; and if you give me leave, 
and God His blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be 
brought home to the great circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith 
aU embrace, and that even while you stay here.” Upon this 1 said, “I shall 



258 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

not only give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it.” What followec 
I shall mention in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame. “Why 
really,” says he, “it is of the same nature. And I will proceed, asking youi 
leave, with the same plainness as before. It is about your poor savages, whc 
are, as I may say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or oughi 
to be, received amtmg all Christians, of what church or pretended chi^rci 
soever, that the Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all posaibl( 
means, and on all possible occasions. It is on this principle that our Chu\-d 
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that our clergy, even'd 
the superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the mosi 
dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach them xh 
knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to embrace the Christiar 
faith. Now, sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and 
thirty poor savages brought over from a state of idolatry to the knowledge 
of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such ar 
occasion of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a man’s whok 
life.” 

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say. I had here the 
spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before me, let his particular 
principles be of what kind soever. As for me, I had not so much as entertained 
a thought of this in my heart before, and 1 believe I should not have thought 
of it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we am 
work for them to do, we would have used as such, or would have been glad 
to have transported them to any other part of the world; for our business was 
to get rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent 
to any country, so they had never seen their own. I was confounded at his dis- 
course, and knew not what answer to make him. 

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder. “Sir,” says he, “I 
shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any offence.” “No, no,” said I, 
“I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not 
only to think that I should never take any notice or this before, but with re- 
flecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir,” said I, “what 
circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies in a ship freighted by 
merchants, and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain 
their ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals -and Vages on the own- 
ers’ account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay 
more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diem demurrage; nor can I sta) 
upon demurrage above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen already 
so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work, unless I would suffei 
myself to be left behind here again; in which case, if this single ship should 
miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition that 
I was left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully deliy 
ored/* He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage; but laid it 
hmie upon my conscience, whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven soul* 
was not worth venturing all I had in the world for. I was not so sensible ol 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


2S9 


that as he was. I replied to him thus: “Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, 
to be an instrument in God’s hands to convert thirty-seven heathens to die 
nowledge of Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and arc given over to the 
,/ork, it seems so natural to fall into the way of your profession; so how is it, 
then, that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it than press me to 
do it?” 

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and putting 
,ne to a full stop, made me a very low bow. “I most heartily thank God and 
you, sir,” said he, “for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work; and 
jf you think yourself discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will 
' nost readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and difE- 
;ulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I am 
dropped at last into so glorious a work.” 

1 discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke tliis to me; his eyes 
;parkled like fire, his face glowed, and his color came and went, as if he had 
jeen falling into fits; in a word, he was fired with the joy of being embarked 
n such a work. I paused a considerable while before I could tell what to say 
to him; for I was really surprised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal, and 
[carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his profession 
only, but even of any profession whatsoever. But after I had considered it a 
i\\bilc, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would venture, 
bn the single consideration of an attempt to convert those poor people, to be 
Socked up in an unplantcd island for perhaps his life, and at last might not 
Know whether he should be able to do them good or not. 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a venture? “Pray, 
sir,” said he, “what do you think 1 consented to go in your ship to the East 
Judies for?” “Nay,” said I, “that 1 know not, unless it was to preach to the 
Indians.” “Doubtless it was,” said he, “and do you think, if 1 can convert these 
thirt) -seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time, though 
I should never be fetched off the island again?— nay, is it not infinitely of more 
worth to save so many souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the 
^ame profession? Yes, sir,” says he, “I would give Christ and the blessed Virgin 
hanks all my days, if I could be made the happy instrument of saving the souls 
>f those poor men, though I were never to get my foot off this island, or see 
ny native country any more. But since you will honor me with putting me 
into this work, for which 1 will pray for you all the days of my life, I have 
lone humble petition to you besides.” “What is that?” said I. “Why,” says he, 
f‘it is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to 
and to assist me; for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they 
jto me,” 

! I V'as sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not think 
bf parting with him, and that for many reasons: he had been the companion 
of my travels; he was not only faithful to me, but sincerely afiPectionate to the 
last degree; andl I had resolved to do something considerable for him if he 
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred 
Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to 



360 WORKS OF DAMEL DEFOE 

embrace another religion; and he would never, while his eyes were open, be- 
lieve that his old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and this might 
in the end ruin the poor fellow’s principles, and so turn him back to his fost 
idolatry. However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it was this 
I told him I could not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any 
account whatever, though a work that to him was of more value than his 
life, ought to be to me of much more value than the keeping or part- 
ing with a servant. But, on the other hand, I was persuaded that Fj^iday 
would by no means agree to part with me; and I could not force him it 
without his consent, without manifest injustice; because I had promts^ I 
would never send him away, and he had promised and engaged to me that 
he would never leave me, unless I sent him away. 

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational access to these 
poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of their language, nor they 
one of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him Friday’s father had learned 
Spanish, which I found he also understood, and he should serve him as an 
interpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him 
but he would stay and endeavor to convert them; but Providence gave another 
very happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we came to the 
Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after some account given them 
of what I had done for them, viz.: what necessary things I had provided for 
them, and how they were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and 
very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and 
gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had taken of it, and 
arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked them if they j 
were married men or bachelors? They soon explained their condition to me, 
and showed that two of them were widowers, and the other three were single ' 
men, or bachelors. I asked them with what conscience they could take these 
women, and call them their wives, and have so many children by them, and 
not be lawfully married to them> 

They all gave me the answer I expected, viz.: that there was nobody to 
marry them; that they agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives 
and to maintain them and own them as their wives; and they thought, as things 
stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had been married b} 
a parson, and with all the formalities in the world. - ^ 

1 told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, and were 
bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men 
being otherwise, they might desert the poor women and children here- 
after; and that their wives, being poor desolate women, friendless and 
moneyless, would have no way to help themselves. I therefore told them 
ttot, unless I was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing 
^em, but would take care that what I did should be for the women and 
chi^ren without them; and that, unless they would give me some assurances 
di!a#liiiey would marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they 
contmue together as man and wife; for that it was both scandalous to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 261 

men and offensive to God, who they could not think would bless them if 
they went on thus. 

All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially Will Atkins^ who 
now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if 
they had been bom in their own native country, and would not leave them 
on any account whatever; and they did verily believe that their wives were as 
virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them 
and for their children, as any women could possibly do; and they would not 
part with them on any account; and Will Atkins, for his own particular, added, 
that if any man would take him away, and offer to carry him home to England, 
and make him captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he would not go with 
him, if he might not carry his wife and children with him; and if there was a 
clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her now with all his heart. 

This is just as I would have it. The priest was not with me at that moment, 
but was not far off: so to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman with 
me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him married next morning, and bade 
him consider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need not 
consider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a 
minister with me, and he believed they would be all willing also. I then told him 
that my friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English, 
but 1 would act the clerk between them. He never so much as asked me 
whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was, indeed, what I was afraid of; 
so wc parted: I went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk 
with his companions. I desired the French gentleman not to say anything to 
them till the business was thoroughly ripe; and 1 told him what answer die 
men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me, and told me they had 
been considering what 1 had said; that they were glad to hear I had a clergy- 
man in my company, and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction I 
desired, and to be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they were far 
from desiring to part with their wives, and that they meant nothing but what 
vas very honest when they chose them. So I appointed them to meet me the 
next morning; and, in the meantime, they should let their wives know the 
meaning of the marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent any scandal, 
but also to oblige them that they should not forsake them, whatever might 
happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing, and were 
very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had reason to be: so they failed not 
to attend all together at my apartment next morning, when I brought out my 
clergyman; and though he had not on a minister s gown, after die manner of 
England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of France, yet having a 
black vest something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very 
unlike a minister; and as for his language, I was his interpreter. But the 
seriousness of his behavior to them, and the scruples he made of marrying the 
’^omen, because they were not baptized and professed Christians, gave them 
an exceeding reverence for his person; and there was no need, after that, to 



262 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

inquire whether he was a clergyman or not. Indeed, I was afraid his scruple 
would have been carried so far as that he would not have married them a 
all; nay, notwithstanding ^1 I was able to say to him, he resisted me, thougl 
modestly, yet very steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry theiti 
unless he had first talked with the men, and the women too; and though a 
first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good-will 
perceiving the sincerity of his design. i 

When he came to them, he let them know that I had acquainted him '^itl 
their circumstances, and with the present design; that he was very willing t( 
perform that part of his function, and marry them, as I had desired; but Aa 
before he could do it, he must take the liberty to talk with them. He told theipi 
that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the sense of the laws of society 
they had lived all this while in open fornication; and that it was true, thai 
nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating them from one 
another, could now put an end to it; but there was a difficulty in it too, wit! 
respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, which he was not fully satisfice 
about— that of marrying one that is a professed Christian to a savage, at 
idolater, and a heathen,— one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not see 
that there Avas time left to endeavor to persuade the women to be baptued 
or to profess the name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing 
of, and without which they could not be baptized. He told them he doubtec 
they were but indifferent Christians themselves; that they had but little know! 
edge of God or of His ways, and therefore he could not expect that they had 
said much to their wives on that head yet; but that, unless they would promise 
him to use their endeavors with their wives to persuade them to become 
Christians, and would, as well as they could, instruct them in the knowledge 
and belief of God that made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed 
them, he could not marry them; for he would have no hand in joining Christians 
with savages, nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian religion, 
and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in God^s law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very faithfully to 
them from his mouth, as near his own words as I could; only sometimes addinj 
something of my own, to convince them how just it was, and that I was of his 
mind; and I always very faithfully distinguished between what I said from 
myself, and what were the clergyman’s words. They told me it was very true 
what the gentleman said, that they were very indifferent Christians themselves, 
and that they had never talked to their wives about religion. “Lord, sir,” says 
Will Atkins, “how should we teach them religion? Why, we know nothing 
ourselves; and besides, sir,” said he, “should we talk to them of God and Jesus 
Christ, and heaven and hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us wha^ 
we believe ourselves? And if we should tell them that we believe all the things 
we speak of to them, such as of good people going to heaven, and wicked people 
to the devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that believe 
all this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are? Why, sir, ’tis enough tc 
give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing; folks must have some reli^mfl 
themselves before they pretend to teach other people.” “Will Atkins,” said J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 263 

to him, “though I am afraid that what you say has too much truth in it, yet 
can you not tell your wife she is in the wrong; that there is a God, and a religion 
better than her own; that her gods are idols; that^they can neither hear nor 
speak; that there is a great Being that made all things, and that can destroy all 
that He has made; that He rewards the good and punishes the bad; and that we 
are to be judged by Him at last for all we do here? You are not so ignorant, 
but even nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and I am satisfied you 
know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.” “That is true, sir,” said Atkins; 
“but with what face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell 
me inmiediatcly it cannot be true?” “Not true!” said I; “what do you mean 
by that?” “Why, sir,” said he, “she will tell me it cannot be true that this God I 
shall tell her of can be just, or can punish or reward, since I am not punished 
and sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I 
have been, even to her, and to everybody else; and that 1 should be suffered to 
live, that have been always acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good, 
and to what I ought to have done.” “Why, truly, Atkins,” said I, “I am afraid 
thou speakest too much truth;” and with that I informed the clergyman of 
what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. “O,” said the priest, “tell 
him there is one thing will make him the best minister in the world to his 
wife, and that is, repentance; for none teach repentance like true penitents. 
He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the better 
qualified to instruct his wife; he will then be able to tell her that there is not 
only a God, and He is the just Rewardcr of good and evil, but that He is a 
merciful Being, and with infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to 
punish those that offend; waiting to be gracious, and wUling not the death of a 
sinner, but rather that he should return and live; that oftentimes He suffers 
wicked men to go a long time, and even reserves damnation to the general day 
of retribution; that it is a clear evidence of God and of a future state, that 
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till 
they come into another world; and this will lead him to teach his wife the 
doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment. Let him but repent him- 
self, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife.” 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, and who, 
we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it; when 
being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an end— “I know all this, master,” 
says he, “and a great deal more; but I have not the impudence to talk thus to 
my wife, when God and my conscience know, and my wife will be an 
undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had never heard of a 
God or future state, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas!”— 
and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could sec that the tears stood in his 
eyes,— “»tis past all that with me.” “Past it, Atkins?” said 1: “what dost thou 
mean by that?” “I know well enough what I mean,” says he; “I mean ’tis too 
iate, and that is too true.” 

1 told the clergyman, word for word, what he said: the poor zealous priest— I 
must call him so, for, be his opinion what it will, he had certainly a most 
singular affection for the good of other men’s souls, and it would be hard to 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

tfaifik he had not the like for his own—I say this affectionate man could not 
jPClfrain from tears; but, recovering himself, said to me, “Ask him but one 
question: Is he easy that is too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were 
not so?” I put the question tairly to Atkins; and he answered with a great deal 
of passion, “How could any man be easy in a condition that must certainly 
end in eternal destruction? that he was far from being easy; but that, on the 
contrary, he believed it would one time or other ruin him.” “What do tyou 
mean by that^” said 1. “Why,” he said, “he believed he should one time or 
other cut his throat, to put an end to the terror of it.” \ 

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face, when I told 
him all this, but turning quick to me upon it, says, “If that be the case, we may 
assure him it is not too late; Christ will give him repentance. But pray,” says 
he, “explain this to him; that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit 
of His passion procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for 
any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the po^;ver 
or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a time when provoked 
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear, but that it is 
never too late for men to ask mercy; and that wc, that are Christ’s servants, are 
commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all 
those that sincerely repent; so that it is never too late to repent.” 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness; but it seemed 
as if he turned off the discourse to the rest, for he said to me, he would go 
and have some talk with his wife; so he went out awhile, and we talked to the 
rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, as 
much as I was when I went rambling away from my father; and yet there were 
none of them backward to hear what had been said: and all of them seriously 
promised that they would talk with their wives about it, and do their endeavors 
to persuade them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they gave, 
but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking his head, “We that are Christ’s 
servants,” says he, “can go no farther than to exhort and instruct: and when 
men comply, submit to die reproof, and promise what wc ask, ’tis aU we can 
do; we are bound to accept their good words; but believe me, sir,” said he, 
*Vhatever you may have known of the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I 
believe he is the only sincere convert among them: I will not despair of the 
rest; but that man is apparendy struck with the scnse~of his past life, and I 
doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself 
effectually into it: for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way 
of teaching ourselves. I know a man who, having nothing but a summary 
iKOtion of religion himself, and being wicked and profligate to the last degree 
hx his life, made a thorough reformation in himself by laboring to convert a 
Jiw. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to 
his wife, my life for it he talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself 
$, penitent, and who knows what may follow!” 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to endeavor 
to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married the other two 



HOBINSON CJIUSOE 26S 

couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. After this, my 
clergyman, waiting awhile, was curious to know where Atkins was ^one; and 
turning to me, said, “I entreat you, sir, let us walk put of your labyrinth here, 
and look; I dare say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking 
seriously to his wife, and teaching her already something of religion.” I began 
to be of the same mind; so we went out together, and I carried him a way 
which none knew but myself, and where the trees were so very thick that it 
was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and so far harder to see in 
than to see out; when commg to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his 
tawny wife sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse: I stopped 
shoit till my clergyman came up to me, and then, having showed him where 
they were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. Wc 
observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun, and to every 
quarter of the heavens, and then down to the eartli, then out to the sea, then 
to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. “Now,” says the clergyman, 
“you see my words are made good, the man preaches to her: mark him now; 
he IS telling her that our God had made him and her, and the heavens, the 
earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c.” “1 believe he is,” said I. Immediately 
wc perceived Will Atkms start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and 
lift up both his hands. We supposed he said something, but we could not hear 
him, It was too far for that. He did not contmue kneeling half a minute, but 
conics and sits down again by his wife, and talks to her again; we perceived 
then the woman very attentive, but whether she said anything to him we 
could not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the tears 
run plentifully down my clergyman’s checks, and 1 could hardly forbear 
myself, but it was a great affliction to us both that we were not near enough to 
hear anything that passed between them. Well, however, we could come no 
nearer for fear of disturbing them: so we resolved to see an end of this piece of 
still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voice* 
He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to 
her, and two or three times we could see him embrace her most passionately^ 
another time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and 
then kiss her again with a kind of transport very unusual; and after several of 
these things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand 
to help her up, when immediately leading her by the hand a step or two, they 
both kneeled down together, and continued so for about two mmutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, “St. Paul! St. Paul! 
behold he prayeth.” I was afraid Atkins would hear him; therefore I entreated 
hmi to withhold himself awhile, that we might see an end of the scene, which 
to me, 1 must confess, was the most affecting that I ever saw in my life. Well, 
he strove with himself for a while, but was in such raptures, to think that this 
poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was not able to contain 
bimself; he wept several times, then throwing up his hands and crossing his 
breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and by the way of giving God 
thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our endeavors; some 
he spoke softly, and I could not well hear others; some in Latin, some in French| 



266 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

then two or three times the tears would interrupt him, that he could not speak 
at all; but I begged that he would contain himself, and let us more narrowly 
and fully observe what was before us, which he did for a time, the scene not 
being near ended yet; for after the poor man and his wife were risen again 
from their knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we 
observed her motion, that she was greatly affected with what he said, by her 
frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such other 
postures as express the greatest seriousness and attention; this continued j^bout 
half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked away, so we could se^ no 
more of them in that situation. I took this interval to say to the clergyman, 
first, that I was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to; that, 
though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that 1 began to think it 
was all very sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however ignorant they 
might both be, and I hoped such a beginning would yet have a more happy 
end. “And who knows,” said I, “but these two may in time, by instruction and 
example, work upon some of the others?” “Some of them?” said he, turning 
quick upon me; “ay, upon all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages- 
for he has been but little better, as you relate it— should embrace Jesus Christ, 
they will never leave it till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is 
naturally communicative, and he that is once made a Christian will never leave 
a Pagan behind him, if he can help it.” I owned it was a most Christian 
principle to think so, and a testimony of true zeal, as well as a generous heart in 
him. “But, my friend,” said I, “will you give me leave to start one difficulty 
here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate con- 
cern which you show for the turning of the poor people from their Paganism 
to the Christian religion; but how does this comfort you, while these people 
are, in your account, out of the pale of the Catholic church, without which 
you believe there is no salvation? so that you esteem these but heretics, as 
effectually lost as the Pagans themselves.” 

To this he answered, with abundance of candor, thus: “Sir, I am a Catholic 
of the Roman church, and a priest of the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace 
all the principles of the Roman faith: but yet, if you will believe me, and that 1 
do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my circumstances and your 
civilities; I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves 
reformed, without some charity: I dare not say (though I know it is our 
opinion in general) that you cannot be saved; I wilhby 'no means limit the 
mercy of Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you into the bosom 
of his church, in a manner to us unperceivable; and 1 hope you have the same 
charity for us: I pray daily for your being all restored to Christ’s church, by 
whatsoever method He, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the meantime^ 
surely you will allow it consists with me, as a Roman, to distinguish far between 
a Protestant and a Pagan; between one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in ^ 
way which 1 do not think is according to the true faith, and a savage or a 
barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not 
within the pale of the Catholic church, we hope you are nearer being restored 
to it than mose who know nothing of God or of His church; and I rejoice* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 267 

therefore, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has been a profligate, and 
almost a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did, 
though not fully enlightened; believing that God, from whom every such work 
proceeds, will sensibly touch his heart, and bring him to the further knowledge 
of that truth in his own time; and if God shall influence this poor man to 
convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, I can never believe that he 
shall be cast away himself. And have 1 not reason, then, to rejoice, the nearer 
any arc brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they may not be brought 
quite home into the bosom of the Catholic church just at the time when I may 
desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect his work in his own 
time, and in his own way? Certainly, 1 would rejoice if ail the savages in 
America were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to God, though they 
were all to be Protestants at first, rather than they should continue Pagans or 
Heathens; firmly believing, that He that had bestowed the first light on them 
vould further illuminate them with a beam of His heavenly grace, and bring 
them into the pale of His church, when He should see good.” 

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious Papist, as much 
as 1 was oppressed by the power of liis reasoning; and it presently occurred to 
iny thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, we might be all Catholic 
Christians, whatever church or particular profession we joined in; that a spirit 
of charity would soon work us all up into right principles; and as he thought 
that the like charity would make us all Catholics, so 1 told him I believed, had 
all the members of his church the like moderation, they would soon all be 
Protestants. And there we left that part; for we never disputed at all. 

However, 1 talked to him another w^ay, and taking him by the hand, “My 
friend,” says I, “I wash all the clergy of the Romish church were blessed with 
such moderation, and had an equal share of your charity. I am entirely of 
your opinion; but 1 must tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine in 
Spain or Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition.” “It may be so,” said 
he; “1 know not what they would do in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they 
would be the better Christians for that severity; for I am sure there is no 
heresy in abounding with charity.” 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there was over; 
so we went back our own way; and when we came back, we found them 
waiting to be called in: observing this, I asked my clergyman if we should 
discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not; and it was his 
opinion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, and hear what he 
would say to us: so we called him in alone, nobody being in the place but 
ourselves, and I began with him thus:— 

‘‘Will Atkins,” said 1, “prythee what education had you? What was your 
[father?” ’ ’ 

-^.-A better man than ever I shall be, sir; my father was a clergyman. 

R* C.— What education did he give you? 

W, /4.-~He would have taught me well, sir, but I despised all education, 
j uistruction, or correction, like a beast as I was. 

R* C.-It is true, Solomon says, “He that despises reproof is brutish.” 



26 


wnuK^ OF nAxriFT. nFFm 


W, ^4.— Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered my father: for God’s 
sake, sir, talk no more about that; sir, I murdered my poor father. 

^ R, C.— Ha! a murderer! 

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word he spoke) and looked 
pale: it seems he believed that Will had really killed his father. 

R. C— No, no, sir; I do not understand him so: Will Atkins, explain your« 
self; you did not kDl your father, did you, with your own hands? 

W. /I .—No, sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the thread of all his com- 
forts, and shortened his days; 1 broke his heart by the most ungrateful, 
unnatural return, for the most tender and affectionate treatment that ^ver 
father gave, or child could receive. 

R, C.— Well, I did not ask you about your father to extort this confession: 1 
pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive that and all your other sins, 
but I asked you because 1 see that though you have not much learning, yet 
you are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good, that you have 
known more of religion, a great deal, than you have practised. 

W, Though you, sir, do not extort the confession that I make about niy 
father, conscience does; and whenever we come to look back upon our lives, 
the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly the first to touch us; the 
wounds they make lie deepest, and the weight they leave will lie heaviest 
upon the mind, of all the sms we can commit. 

R, C.— You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; I cannot bear it, 
W, You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothing of it. 

JR. C.— Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, 1 may say every tree in this 
island, is witness to the anguish of my soul for my ingratitude to, and bad; 
usage of, a good tender father, a father much like yours, by your description 
and I murdered my father as well as you, Will Atkins; but 1 think, for all 
that, my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal. 

I would have said more, if 1 could have restrained my passions; but I thought 
this poor man’s repentance was so much sincercr than mine, that 1 was going 
to leave off the discourse and retire; for I was surprised with what he said, and 
thought that instead of my going about to teach and instruct him, the man was 
made a teacher and instructor to me in a most surprising and unexpected 
manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected with 
it, and said to me, “Did I not say, sir, that when this man was converted he 
would preach to us all? 1 tell you, sir, if this one man be made a true penitent, 
there will be no need of me; he will make Christians of all in the island.*’ But 
having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will Atkin& 
“But, \Vill,” said I, “how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now^” 
W, Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart through my 
ireiy'soul; I have been talking about God and religion to my wife, in order, 
yovL directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has preached such * 
‘viermon to me as I shall never forget while I live, 

K. C.— No, no; it is not your wife has preached to you; but when you were 
^ moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung them back upon yo'i' 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 269 

JV. A.'-Ay, sir, with such force as is not to be resisted. 

R. C.— Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and your wife; for I 
know something of it already. 

W. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it; I am too full 
to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it; but let her have said what she 
will, though I cannot give you an account of it, this I can tell you, that I have 
resolved to amend and reform my life. 

R, C.—But tell us some of it: how did you begin. Will? For this has been 
an extraordinary case, that is certain. She has preached a sermon, indeed, if she 
ihas wrought this upon you. 

I W. Why, 1 first told her the nature of our laws about marriage, and 
Iwhat the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter into such 
compacts, as it was neither in the power of one nor other to break; that other- 
wise, order and justice could not be maintained, and men would run from 
their wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one another, and 
neither families be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by legal descent. 

R. C.—You talk like a civilian. Will. Could you make her understand what 
you meant by inheritance and families? They know no such things among 
the savages, but marry anyhow, without regard to relation, consanguinity, or 
family; brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the father and the 
daughter, and the son and the mother. 

W, believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife assures me of the 
contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps, for any further relations, they may 
not be so exact as we are; but she tells me never in the near relationship you 
speak of. 

R. C.— Well, what did she say to what you told her? 

W, She said she liked it very well, as it was much better than in her 
country. 

K. C.—But did you tell her what marriage was? 

Ay, ay, there began our dialogue. I asked her if she would be married 
to me our way. She asked me what way that was. I told her marriage was 
appointed by God; and here we had a strange talk together, indeed, as ever 
fiian and wife had, I believe. 

N. B. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife I took down in 
ivriting, just after he had told it me, which was as follows:— 

Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in your country? 

B". /!.— Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 

IPife.— No your God in my country; my country have the great old Bena- 
tnuckce God. 

Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is; God is in heaven, 
ind made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. 

IF/fe.— No makee de earth; no you God makee all earth no makee my 
country, 

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not making her country. 

No laugh; why laugh me? This nothing to laugh. 

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious than he at first. 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


270 

W* ^.—That’s true, indeed; I will not laugh any more, my dear. 

Wife.— Why, you say you God makec all? 

W. A.— Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you, and me, and 
all things; for he is the only true God, and there is no God but him; he lives 
forever in heaven. 

Wife.— Why you no tell me long ago? 

W. A.— That's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked wretch, and havp' not 
only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything before, but have lived without 
God in the world myself. \ 

Wife.— What, have you a great God in your country, you no know hjfii? 
No say O to him? No do good thing for him? That no possible. 

W. A.— It is true; though, for alJ that, we live as if there was no God in 
heaven, or that he had no power on earth. 

Wife.— But why God let you do so? Why he no makee you good live? 

W. A.— It is all our own fault. 

Wife.— But you say me he is great, much great, have much great power, 
can makee kill when he will; why he no makee kill when you no serve him^ 
No say O to him? No be good mans? 

W. That is true; he might strike me dead; and I ought to expect it, for I 
have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but God is merciful, and does not deal 
with us as we deserve. 

Wife.— But then you do not tell God thankee for that too? 

W. A.—T>^o, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy, any more than I 
have feared God for his power. 

Wife.— Then your God no God; me no think believe he be such one, great 
much power strong: no makee kill you, though you makee him much angr) 

W. What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in God? What 
a dreadful creature am I! and what a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of 
Christians hinder the conversion of heathens! 

Wife.— How me think you have great much God up there [she points up to 
heaven], and yet no do well, no do good thing? Can he tell? Sure he no tell 
what you do. 

W. A.— Yes, yes, he knows and secs all things; he hears us speak, sees what 
we do, knows what we think, though we do not speak. 

Wife.— What\ he no hear you curse, swear, speak dc great damn? 

W. -4.— Yes, yes, he hears it all. ^ 

Wife.— Where be then the much great power strong? 

W. A.— He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and this proves him to 
be the true God; he is God, and not man, and therefore we arc not consumed. 

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think how he could 
tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret though 
of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that he had dared to do all the vile 
things he had done. 

Merciful! What you call that? 

W. A.— He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and spares us. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 271 

Wtfe.So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do wicked; then 
he no good himself, or no great able. 

W, y4.— Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely great, and 
able to punish too; and sometimes, to show his justice and vengeance, he lets 
fly his anger to destroy sinners and make examples; many are cut off in 
their sins. 

But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you, may be, that he no 
makee you kill: so you makee de bargain with him, you do bad thing, he no 
1 be angry at you when he be angry at other mans. 

1 W, W.— No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon his goodness; and 
he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me, as he has done other men. 

Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what you say to him for 
that? You no tell him thankee for all that too? 

W, A.— I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is true. 

Wtfc\— Why he no makee you much good better? you say he makee you. 

W, A— He made me as he made all the world; it is I have deformed myself, 
and abused his goodness, and made myself an abominable wretch. 

wish you makee God know me, I no makee him angry. I no do 
bad wicked thing. 

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a poor untaught 
creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a wicked wretch, that 
he could not say one word to her about God, but what the reproach of his own 
; carriage would make most irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she 
jhad told him that she could not believe in God, because he, that was so wicked, 
[Was not destroyed, 

IF. A.— My dear, you mean, you wish 1 could teach you to know God, not 
iod to know you; for he knows you already, and every thought in your heart. 
IFifc.— Why, then, he know what 1 say to you now: he know me wish to 
[know him. How shall me know who makee me? 

W, Poor creature, he must teach thee: I cannot teach thee. I will pray 
|to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me, that am unworthy to 
each thee. 

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make her know 
God, and her wishing to know him, that he said he fell down on his knees 
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the saving knowl- 
edge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the 
'inworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of religion; after 
'yhich he sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on. This was the 
time when we saw him kneel down, and hold up his hands. 

What you put down the knee for? What you hold up the hand for? 
^hat you say? Who you speak to? What is all that? 

-d!.— My dear, I bow my knees in token of my submission to him that 
fiade me: I said O to him, as you call it, and as your old men do to their idol 
dcnainuckee: that is, I prayed to him. 

What say you O to him for? 



272 wnnirs ni? nAxrrtrr. nF^OE 

W. I prayed to him to open your eyes and your understandii^, that you 
may know him and be accepted by him. 

Can he do that too? 

W, A.-Yes, he can: he can do all things. 

But now he hear what you say? 

W> A.— Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear us. 

Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid you? What, yqii hear 
him speak? \ 

W, No, we do not hear him speak, but he has revealed himself many \ways 
to us. > 

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God has revealed 
Himself to us by His word, and what His word was; but at last he told it to 
her thus:— 

W» God has spoken to some good men in former days, even from heaven 
by plain words; and God has inspired good men by His spirit; and they hav« 
written all His laws down in a book. 

Wffe»--Me no understand that; where is book? 

Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book; but I hope I shall one 
time or other get it for you, and help you to read it. 

Here he embraced her with great affection, but with inexpressible grief that 
he had not a Bible. 

Wife.— But how you makee me know that God teachce them to write 
that book? 

W, A.— By the same rule that we know him to be God. 

What rule? What way you know him^ 

W, A.— Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is good 
righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly good, as well as perfectl) 
happy; and because he forbids, and commands us to avoid, all that is wicked 
that is evil in itself, or evil in its consequence. 

Wife.— That me would understand, that me fain see; if he teachee all good 
thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing, he hear me when I say 0 
to him, as you do just now; he makee me good, 5 I wish to be good; he spare 
me, no makee kill me, when I no be good: all this you say he do, yet he be 
great God: me takee, think, believe him to be great God; me say O to him 
with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but““raised her up, made her 
kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge 
of himself, by his spirit, and that by some good providence, if possible, sbj 
might, some time or other, come to have a Bible, that she might read the word 
of God, and be taught by it to know Him. This was the time that we saw him 
lift her up by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too long to be 
down here; and particularly she made him promise that, since he confessed^ 
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of provocations against 
he would reform it, and not make God angry any more, lest He should 
him dead, as she called it, and then she would be left alone, and never ^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 273 

taught to know diis God better; and lest he should be miserable, ad he had 
told her wicked men would be, after death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both, but particularly 
to the young clergyman; he was, indeed, wonderfully surprised with it, but 
under the greatest affliction imaginable that he could not talk to her, that he 
could not speak English, to make her understand him; and as she spoke but 
very broken English, he could not understand her; however, he turned himself 
to me, and told me that he believed that there must be more to do with this 
(woman than to marry her. I did not understand him at first; but at length he 
[explained himself, viz.: that she ought to be baptized. I agreed with him in 
that part readily, and wished it to be done presently. “No, no; hold, sir,” said 
he, “though 1 would have her be baptized, by all means,— for I must observe 
that Will Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, 
to be willing to embrace a religious life, and has given her just ideas of the being 
of a God; of His power, justice, and mercy,— yet I desire to know of him if he 
has said anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the 
nature of faith in him, and redemption by him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrec- 
tion, the last judgment and the future state.” 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor fellow fell im- 
mediately into tears, and told us he had said something to her of all those 
things, but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own conscience 
so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the 
apprehensions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should 
gi\e to those things, and make her rather contemn religion than receive it; 
but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to receive due 
impressions of all those things, and that if I would but discourse with her 
she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labor would not be lost 
Mpon her. 

Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter between my 
religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to begin with her; but sure 
such a sermon was never preached by a Popish priest in these latter ages of 
the world; and, as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, 
all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of a Roman Catholic; and 
that I took him to be such a clergyman as the Roman bishops were, before the 
church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men. In 
a ^^ord, he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ, 
and of redemption by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did 
the first notions of a God, but with joy and faith; with an affection, and a 
surprising degree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to be 
expressed; and, at her own request, she was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that he would 
perform that office with some caution, that the man might not perceive he 
'^ as of the Roman church, if possible, because of other ill consequences which 
attend a difference among us in that very religion which we were 
instructing the other in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel, nor 
proper things for the office, I should see he would do it in a manner that I 



274 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

should not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not 
known it before; and so he did; for saying only some words over to himself 
in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water 
upon the woman’s head, pronouncing in French, very loud, “Mary [which was 
the name her husband desired to give her, for I was her godfather], I baptize 
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;” so 
that none could know anything by it what religion he was of. He gave the 
benediction afterwards in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know hut it 
was French, or else did not take notice of it at that time. \ 

As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the marriage was oVer, 
he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner exhorted him, pot 
only to persevere in that good disposition he was in, but to support the 
convictions that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; told him 
it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes: represented to 
him how God had honored him with being the instrument of bringing his wife 
to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he should be careful he 
should not dishonor the grace of God; and that if he did, he would see the 
heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage converted, and the instru- 
ment cast away. He said a great many good things to them both; and then, 
recommending them to God’s goodness, gave them the benediction again, I 
repeating everything to them in English; and thus ended the ceremony. I think 
it was the most pleasant and agreeable day to me that ever I passed in m} 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet: his thoughts hung continually upon 
the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and fain he would have staid upon 
the island to have undertaken it; but I convinced him, first, that his under- 
taking was impracticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it 
into a way of being done in his absence to his satisfaction. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass, I was 
preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had taken out of 
the famished ship’s company came to me, and told me he understood I had a 
clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to 
the savages; that he had a match too, which he desired might be finished before 
I went, between two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable 
to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother’s servant, for 
there was no other Christian woman on the island: so I began to persuade him j 
not to do anything of that kind rashly, or because he found himself in this ' 
solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he had some considerable 
substance in the world, and good friends, as I understood by himself, and the 
maid also; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was unequal w 
him, she being six or seven and twenty years old, and he not above seventeen 1 
or eighteen; that he might very probably, with my assistance, make a remove 
from this wilderness, and come into his own country again; and that then 
would be a thousand to one but he would repent his choice, and the dislike oi 
that circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to say 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 275 

[)ut he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that 
[ mistook in my guesses—that he had nothing of that land in his thoughts; and 
iic was very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a way to see 
their own country again; and nothing should have made him think of staying 
there, but that the voyage 1 was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, 
iiid would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends; that he had noth- 
inc: to desire of me, but that 1 w^ould settle him in some litde property in the 
island where he was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and 
he would live here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever 1 re- 
turned to England, J would redeem him; and hoped 1 would not be unmindful 
i)f him when 1 came to England; that he would give me some letters to his 
friends in London, to let them know how good 1 had been to him, and in what 
part of the world, and what circumstances 1 had left him in: and he promised 
me that w'hencver 1 redeemed him, the plantation, and all the improvements 
he had made upon it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his youth, and the 
nore agreeable to me, because he told me positively the match was not for 
himself. 1 gave him all possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to Eng- 
land, 1 would deliver his letters, and do his business effectually; and that he 
blight depend I should never forget the circumstances 1 had left him in; but 
^till I was impatient to know' w ho was the person to be married; upon which he 
told inc it was iny Jack-of-all-tradcs and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably 
prprised when he named the match; for, indeed, I thought it very suitable. 
The character of that man I have given already; and as for the maid, she was 
L very honest, modest, sober, and religious young woman; had a very good 
;hare of sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handsomely and 
:o the purpose, always w ith decency and good manners, and was neither too 
)ackward to speak when requivsite, nor impertinently forward when it was not 
ler business; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent manager; fit, in- 
Iccd, to have been governess to the whole island, and she knew very well how 
0 behave in every respect. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them the same day; 
nd as I was father at the altar, and gave her away, so I gave her a portion; for 
appointed her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for their 
blantation; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the young gentleman 
nade to give him a small property in the island, put me upon parcelling it out 
mon^t them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was now grown 
sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly pious and 
religious; and, as far as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I 
prily believe he was a true penitent. He divided things so justly, and so much 
0 every one’s satisfaction, that they only desired one general writing under 
hand for the whole, which 1 caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed, 
«tting out the bounds and situation of every man’s plantation, and testifying 
hat I gave them thereby severally a right to the whole possession and in- 
^ntance of the respective plantations or farms, with their improvements, to 



276 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as my own propert>, 
and a certain rent for every particular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any 
one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy of 
the same writing 

As to the government and laws among them, T told them I was not capable 
of giving them better rules than they were able to give themselves, only I made 
them promise me to live in love and good neighborhood with one anothe(r, and 
so I prepared to leave them 

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now settled in a kihd of 
commonwealth among themselves, and having much business in hand, ic was 
odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independent 
and, indeed, uncniplojcd, for, excepting the providing themselves food, vhicli 
they had difficult) enough to do sometimes, they had no manner of business or 
property to manage 1 proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that he 
should go to them, m ith h riday s father, and propose to them to remove, and 
either plant for themselves, or be taken into their several families as servants to 
be maintained for their libor, but without being absolute slaves, for I would 
not permit them to make them slaves by force, by any means, because they had 
their liberty given them by capitulation, as it w ere articles of surrender, which 
they ought not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and c'^me all very cheerfull\ 
along with him so we allotted them land and plantations, which three or four 
accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the several 
famihes we had settled, and thus my colony was in a manner settled as fol 
lows —The Spaniards possessed my original habitation, w hich was the capital 
city , and extended their plantations all along the side of the brook, which nnde 
the creek that I have so often desciibed, as far as my bower, and as they in 
creased their culture, it w ent always eastward The Lnglish liv ed in the north 
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, and came on southward 
and south-west, towards the back part of the Spaniards, and every plantation 
had a great addition of land to take in, if they found occasion, so that they ned 
not jostle one another for want of room All the east end of the island was left 
uninhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there only for 
their usual customary barbarities, they might come and go, if they disturbed 
nobody, nobody would disturb them and no doubt but tfiey were often ashore, 
and went away again, for I never heard that the planters were ever attacked or 
disturbed any more 

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the clergy 
man that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be set on foot m b® 
absence to his satisfaction, and I told him that now I thought that it was put 
fair way, for the savages, being thus divided among the Christians, if they wouW 
every one of them do their part with those which came under their handStj 
I hoped It might have a very good effect. - 

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. “But how,” says he, 
we obtain that of them^” 1 told him we would call them all together, and 
M in charge with them, or go to them, one by one, which he thought best, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 277 

; divided it,— he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists, and I to speak 
the English, who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly 
them, and made them promise that they would never make any distinction of 
pist or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but teach 
em the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; 
d they likewise promised us that they would never have any differences or 
>putes one with another about religion. 

When 1 came to Will Atkins’s house (I may call it so, for such a hoase, or 
ch a piece of basket-work, I believe was not standing in the world again), 
ere I found the young woman I have mentioned above and Will Atkins’s 
[fe were become intimates; and this prudent, religious young woman had per- 
cted the work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four days 
ter what I have related, yet the new-bapti/cd savage woman was made such 
Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my observation or conversation in 
e world. 

It came next into my mind in the morning before I went to them, that 
riongst all the needful things 1 had to leave with them. I had not left them a 
ble, in which I showed myself less considering for them than my good friend 
e widow' was for me when she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds from 
isbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-book. However, the 
)od woman’s charity had a greater extent than ever she imagined, for they 
ere reserved for the comfort and instruction of those that made much better 
;e of them than I had done. 

1 took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will Atkins’s tent, 

• house, and found the young woman and Atkins’s baptized wife had been 
scoursing of religion together—for Will Atkins told it me w ith a great deal of 
ly— 1 asked if they were together now, and he said, yes; so I went into the 
)use, and he with me, and we found them together very earnest in discourse. 
3, sir,” says Will Atkins, “when God has sinners to reconcile to Himself, and 
iens to bring home, He never wants a messenger; my wife has got a new in- 
ructor: I knew I was unworthy as I was incapable of that work; that young 
Oman has been sent hither from heaven; she is enough to convert a whole 
land of savages.” The young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I 
psired her to sit still; I told her she had a good work upon her hands, and 
hoped God would bless her in it. 

jWe talked a little, and 1 did not perceive that they had any book among 
km, though 1 did not ask; but 1 put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out 
\y Bible. “Here,” said I to Atkins, “1 have brought you an assistant that per- 
^ps you had not before.” The man was so confounded, that he was not able 
I S‘peak for some time; but, recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands, 
turning to his wife, “Here, my dear,” says he, “did not I tell you our God, 
iough he lives above, could hear what we have said? Here’s the book I prayed 
when you and I kneeled down under the bush; now God has heard us, and 
|nt it.” When he had said so, the man fell into such transports of passionate joy, 
lat between the joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran 
Pwn his face like a child that was crying.

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake that none 
of us were aware of, for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon her 
husband’s petition. It is true that providentially it was so, and might be taken so 
in a consequent sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult matter at that 
time to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an express mes- 
senger came from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book; but it was 
too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take place; so I turned to the 
young woman, and told her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert, 
in her first and more ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to ex-, 
plain to her that God may be very properly said to answer our petitions, when, \ 
in the course of His providence, such things are in a particular manner brought > 
to pass as we petitioned for: but we did not expect returns from heaven in a 
miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy that it is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there was, I assure 
jrou, no priestcraft used here; and I should have thought it one of tlie most un- 
justifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. But the surprise of joy upon 
Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; and there we may be sure was no de- 
lusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the world for anything of its 
kind than he was for the Bible,— nor, 1 believe, never any man was glad of a 
Bible from a better principle; and though he had been a most profligate crea- 
ture, headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, )^et this man is a standing 
rule to us all for the well instructing children, viz.: that parents should never 
give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of the success of their endeavors, 
let the children be ever so refractory, or, to appearance, insensible to instruc- 
tion; for, if ever God, in His providence, touches the conscience of such, the 
force of their education returns upon them and the early instruction of parents 
is not lost, though it may have been many years laid asleep, but some time or 
other they may find the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man, however 
ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had some to 
do with now more ignorant than himself, and that the least part of the instruc- 
tion of his good father that now came to his mind was of use to him. 

Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his father used to insist so 
much on the inexpressible value of the Bible and the privilege and blessing of 
it to nations, families, and persons; but he never entertained the least notion of 
the worth of it till now, when, being to talk to heathens, savages, and bar- 
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance. 

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion, though she 
had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship, among their goods, which 
were not yet brought on shore. And now, having said so many things of this 
young woman, I cannot omit telling one story more of her and myself, which 
has something in it very instructive. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young w^oman was reduced,— how 
her mistress was starved to death, and died on board that unhappy ship we met 
at sea, and how the whole ship’s company was reduced to the last extremity. 
The gentlewoman, and her son, and this maid, were first hardly used as to pro- 
visions, and at last totally neglected and starved,— that is to say, brought to the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 279 

last extremity of hunger. One day, being discoursing with her on the extremities 
they had suffered, I asked her if she could describe, by what she had felt, what 
it was to starve, and how it appeared? She told me she believed she could, and 
she told her tale very distinctly thus:— 

“First, sir,” said she, “we had for some days fared exceedingly hard, and suf- 
fered very great hunger; but at last we were wholly without food of any kind, 
except sugar, and a little wine-and-watcr. The first da)/ after I received no food 
at all, I found myself, towards evening, first empty and sick at the stomach, 
and nearer night much inclined to yawning and sleep. I lay down on the couch 
in the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little re- 
freshed, having taken a glass of wine when 1 lay down; after being about three 
hours awake, it being about five o’clock in the morning, 1 found myself empty, 
and my stomach sickish, and lay down again, but could not sleep at all, being 
very faint and ill; and thus I continued all the second day w ith a strange variety, 
—first hungry, then sick again, w ith retchings to vomit. The second night, being 
obliged to go to bed again without any food, more than a draught of fresh 
water, and being asleep, J di earned I was at Barbadocs, and that the market 
was mightily stocked with provisions,— that I bought some for my mistress, and 
went and dined very heartily. 1 thought my stomach was as full after this as it 
would have been after a good dinner; but when 1 awaked, 1 was exceedingly 
sunk in my spirits to find myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass of 
wine wx had 1 drank, and put sugar in it, because of its having some spirit to 
supply nourishment; but there being no substance in the stomach for the digest- 
ing office to work upon, 1 found the only effect of the wine was to raise disa- 
greeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and 1 lay, as they told me, 
stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third day, in the morn- 
ing, after a night of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather doz- 
ing than sleeping, I aw^aked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, 
had not my understanding returned and conquered it, whether, if I had been a 
mother, and had had a little child with me, its life would have been safe or not. 
This lasted about three hours, during wdiich time 1 was twice raging mad as any 
creature in Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can now inform you. 

“In one of those fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down and struck my face 
against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mistress lay, and with the blow the 
blood gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat 
down and bled into it a great deal; and as the blood came from me, I came to my- 
self, and the violence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous 
part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and retched to vomit, but could not, for 
I had nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had bled some time I swooned, 
and they all believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then had 
a most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described— not like the colic, but 
a gnawing, eager pain for food; and towards night it went off with a kind of 
earnest wishing or longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the longing 
of a woman with child. I took another draught of water with sugar in it; but 
my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again; then I took a draught 
of water without sugar, and that staid with me; and I laid me down upon the 



2iO WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

bed, praying most heartily that it would please God to take me away; and 
composing my mind in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then wakmg, 
ibought myself dying, being light with vapors from an empty stomach. I recom- 
mended my soul then to God, and earnestly wished that somebody would 
throw me into the sea. 

“All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, expiring, but bOre it 
with much more patience than I, -gave the last bit of bread she had left to her 
child, my young master, who would not have taken it, but she obliged him tp 
eat it; and I believe it saved his life. 

“Towards the mornmg I slept again; and when I awoke I fell into a violerit 
passion of crying, and after that had a second fit of violent hunger, I got up 
ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition; had my mistress been dead, as much 
as I loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as much 
relish* and as unconcerned as ever I did eat the flesh of any creature appointed 
for food; and once or twice 1 was going to bite my own arm. At last I saw the 
basin in which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day before: I ran to 
it, and swallowed it with much haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I won- 
dered nobody had taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me now. 
After it was down, though the thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet it 
checked the fit of hunger, and I took another draught of water, and was com- 
posed and refreshed for some hours after. This was the fourth day; and thus 
I kept up till toward night, when, within the compass of thiee hours, 1 had all 
the several circumstances over again, one after another, vi/..: sick, sleepy, eagerly 
hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then lunatic, then 
crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour, and my strength 
wasted exceedingly; at night 1 lay me down, having no comfort but in the hope 
that I should die before morning. 

“All this night 1 had no sleep; but the hunger w as now turned into a disease, 
and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind, instead of food, having found 
its way into the bowels, and in this condition I lay ull morning, when I was sur- 
prised by the cries and lamentations of my young master, who called out to me 
that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up a little, for 1 had not strength to rise, 
but found she was not dead, though she w^as able to give very little signs of life. 

“I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some sustenance, as 
I cannot describe; with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, as nothing 
but the tortures of death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard 
the seamen above cry out, ‘A sail! a sail!’ and halloo and jump* about as if they 
Were distracted. 

“I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress much less; and my 
young master w as so sick, that I thought he had been expiring; so w e could not 
open the cabm door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such con- 
fusion; nor had we had any conversation with the ship’s company for two days, 
they having told us that they had not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship; 
and this they told us afterwards,— they thought we had been dead. It was this 
dreadful condition w e were in when you were sent to save our lives; and how 
you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too.” 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 281 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of starving to deaths 
as, I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me. I am the 
rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because the youth gave me an 
account of a good part of it; though I must own, not so distinct and so feeling 
as the maid; and the rather, because it seems his mother fed him at the price 
of her own life: but the poor maid, though her constitution being stronger than 
that of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might 
struggle harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be supposed to feel the ex- 
tremity something sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the 
last bit something longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid. No ques- 
tion, as the case is here related, if our ship, or some other, had not so providen- 
tially met them, a few days more would have ended all their lives, unless they 
had prevented it by eating one another; and that even, as their case stood, would 
have served them but a little while, they being five hundred leagues from any 
land, or any possibility of relief other than m the miraculous manner it hap- 
pened: but this is by the way; I return to my disposition of things among the 
people. 

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I did not think fit to 
let them know anythmg of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of set- 
ting up among them; for I found, at least at my first coming, such seeds of divi- 
sion among them, that I saw plainly, had 1 set up the sloop, and left it among 
them, they would, upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away 
from one another; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the island a den 
of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and religious people, as I intended it; 
nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that 1 had on board, or the two 
quarter-deck guns that my nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason: I 
thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against any that 
should invade them, but not to set them up for an offensive war, or to go abroad 
to attack others; which, in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon 
them: 1 reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service another 
way, as I shall observe in its place. 

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good circumstances, and 
in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship again on the 6th of May, 
having been about twenty-five days among them; and as they were all resolve 
to stay upon the island till I came to remove them, 1 promised to send them 
further relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly find an opportunity; and par- 
ticularly I promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows: as 
to the two cows and calves which I brought from England, we had been 
obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed 
them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we set sail, and 
arrived at the Bay of All Saints in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days, meet- 
ing nothing remarkable in our passage but this: that about three days after we 
had sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E. N. E., run- 
ning, as it were, into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven something 
out of our course, and once or twice our men cried out, “Land to the eastward!”

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


but whether it was the continent or islands we could not tell by any means. But 
the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we saw 
the sea, as it were, covered towards the land with something very black; not 
being able to discover what it was, till after some time, our chief mate, going 
up the main-shrouds a little way, and looking at them m ith a perspective, cried 
out it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an army, and 
thwarted him a little hastily. “Nay, sir,” says he, “don’t be angry, for ’tis an 
army, and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see 
them paddle along, for they are coming towards us apace.” 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew, the captain; for 
he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island, and having never bfeen 
in those seas before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said, two or 
three times, we should all be devoured. 1 must confess, considering we were be- 
calmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, 1 liked it the worse; how- 
ever, I bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as wc 
came so near as to know that we must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace towards us; so I gave 
orders to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails; as for the savages, 1 told them 
they had nothing to fear but fire, and therefore they should get their boats out, 
and fasten them, one close by the head, and the other by the stern, and man 
them both well, and w^ait the issue in that posture: this 1 did that the men in the 
boats might be ready with sheets and buckets to put out any fire these savages 
might endeavor to fix to the outside of the ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came up with 
us; but never was such horrid sight seen by Christians: though my mate was 
much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet when they came up wc 
reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six; some of them had sixteen or seven- 
teen men in them, and some more, and the least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and 
astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had never seen before; nor 
could they at first, as we afterwards understood, know what to make of us, 
they came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about to row 
round us; but we called to our men in the boats not to let them come too near 
them. This very order brought us to an engagement wdth them, without our 
designing it; for five or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which they understood 
very well, and went back: but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board 
us from those boats, and one of our men in the long4)oat was very much 
wounded. However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we handed 
down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind 
of fence, like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, 
if they should shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body astern of us, and so 
near that we could easily discern what they were, though we could not tell their 
design; and I easily found they were some of my old friends, the same sort of 
savages that I had been used to engage with; and in a short time more they

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came directly broadside with us, and 
then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near that they could hear 
us speak; upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot 
any more arrows, and made all our guns ready; but being so near as to be 
within hearing, 1 made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them 
in liis language, to know what they meant; which accordingly he did. Whether 
they understood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had called to 
them, six of them, who were in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their 
canoes from us, and stooping down, showed us their naked backs; whether this 
was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was done in mere con- 
tempt, or as a signal to tlie rest: but immediately Friday cried out they were 
going to shoot, and, unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let fly about three 
hundred of their arrows, and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no 
other man being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three 
arrows, and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky marksmen they 
were’! 

1 was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and companion, that I 
immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot, and four with great, 
and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard in their lives before, to 
be sure. They were not above half a cable’s length off when we fired; and our 
gunners took their aim so well, that three or four of their canoes were overset, 
as we had reason to believe, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backs to us gave us no great offence; 
neither did 1 know for certain whether that which would pass for the greatest 
contempt among us might be understood so by them or not; therefore, in re- 
turn, 1 had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with powder 
only, which I knew would frighten them sufficiently: but when they shot at us 
directly with all the fury they were capable of, and especially as they had killed 
my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so 
well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable before God and man, 
but would have been very glad if I could have overset every canoe there, and 
drowned every one of them. 

1 can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we wounded at this 
broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen among such a multi- 
tude: there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, and 
the men all set a-swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured away 
as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those whose boats were split 
or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them were lost; and our 
men took up one poor fellow swimming for* his life, above an hour after they 
were all gone. 

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great many; 
but, in short, we never knew how it went with them, for they fled so fast that, 
in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not sec above three or four straggling 
canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze of wind springing 
up the same evening, we weighed, and set sail for the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he would 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

neidier eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve himself to death: but 
I took a way to cure him; for I made them take him and turn him into the long- 
boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave 
him where they found him, if he would not speak: nor would that do, but they 
really did throw him into the sea, and came away from him; and then he fol- 
lowed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his tongue, though 
they knew not one word of what he said; however, at last they took him in 
agam, and then he began to be more tractable: nor did I ever design they should 
drown him. ' 

We were now under sail again, but I was the most disconsolate creat^are 
alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been very glad to have g^ne 
back to the island, to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion, 
but it could not be: so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said, and it 
was a long time before we could make him understand anything; but, in time 
our men taught him some English, and he began to be a little tractable. After- 
wards, we inquired what country he came from, but could make nothing of 
what he said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, as he spoke in the throat 
in such a hollow, odd manner, that we could never form a word after him; and 
we were all of opinion that they might speak that language as well if they were 
gagged as otherwise; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either 
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a hunting-horn 
forms a tune with an open throat. He told us, however, some time after, when 
we had taught him to speak a little English, that they were going with their 
kings to fight a great batde. When he said kings, we asked him how many kings? 
He said they were five nation (we could not make him understand the plural 
r), and that they all joined to go against two nation. We asked him what made 
them come up to us? He said, “To makee te great wonder look,” Here it is to be 
observed, that all those natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn Eng- 
lish, always add two e’s at the end of the words where we use one; and they 
place the accent upon them, as makee, takee, and the like; nay, I could hardly 
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last leave of 
him. Poor honest Friday! We buried him with all the decency and solemnity 
possible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him into the sea; and I 
caused them to fire eleven guns for him; and so ended the life of the most grate- 
ful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in about twelve days’ 
time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the 
north-easternmost land of all that part of America. We kept on S. by E., in sight 
of the shore four days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days 
Came to an anchor off the Bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, 
from whence came both my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I had; and yet it was 
witdi great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least correspondence on 
shore: not my partner himself, who was alive, and made a great ngure among 
them, not my two merchant-trustees, not the fame of my wonderful preserva- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 285 

tion in the idand, could obtain me that favor; but my partner, remembering 
that I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of the Monastery of the 
Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monas- 
tery, and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the governor, and get leave 
for me personally, with the captain and one more, besides eight seamen, to 
come on shore, and no more; and this upon condition, absolutely capitulated 
for, that we should not offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any 
person away without license. They were so strict with us, as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three bales of Eng^ 
lish goods, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had brought 
for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, open-hearted man; though, like me, he began with 
little at first; and though he knew not that I had the least design of giving him 
anything, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweet- 
meats, worth above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three or four 
fine medals of gold: but 1 was even with him in my present, which, as I have 
said, consisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine Hollands; also 
I delivered him about the value of one hundred pounds sterling in the same 
goods, for other uses; and 1 obliged him to set up the sloop, which I had brought 
with me from England, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to send 
the refreshments 1 intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very few days, for she 
was already framed, and I gave the master of her such instructions that he 
could not miss the place; nor did he, as 1 had an account from my partner after- 
wards. 1 got him soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them; and one of our 
seamen, that had been on shore with me there, offered to go with the sIom and 
settle there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient 
quantity of land for a plantation, and giving him some clothes and tools for his 
planting work, which he said he understood, having been an old planter at 
Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain, I encouraged the fellow by grant- 
mg all he desired, and, as an addition, 1 gave him the savage whom he had 
taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to 
give him his share of everything he wanted wkh the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me there was a cer- 
tain very honest fellow, a Brazil })Lintcr of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the displeasure of the church. “I know^ not what the matter is with him ” 
says he, “but on my conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has 
been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition,” that he would be 
very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two 
daughters; and if I would let them go to my island, and allot them a plantation, 
he would give them a small stock to begin wdth,~for the officers of the In- 
quisition had seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a litdc 
household stuff, and two slaves: “and,” adds he, “though I hate his principles, 
yet I would not have him fall into their hands, for he will be assuredly burned 
alive if he does.” 

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them; and we con* 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


cealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop 
put out to go to sea; and then having put all their goods on board some time 
before, we put them on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay. 

Oiu: seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner; and their stocks, 
indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm,— but noth- 
ing to begin with, except as above: however, they carried over with them, what 
was worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants 
of canes, which he— I mean the Portugal man— understood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I sent them 
by the sloop three milch cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs ami^ng 
them, three sows big with pig, two marcs, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards, 
according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal women to go, and recoin- 
mended it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have procured 
more women, but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had two daugh- 
ters, and that there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted,— the rest had 
wives of their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and as you may easily suppose, was very welcome 
to my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition, between sixty and 
seventy people, besides little children, of which there were a great many, I 
found letters at London from them all, by way of Lisbon, when 1 came back to 
England, of which 1 shall also take some notice immediately. 

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about it: and 
whoever reads the rest of my memorandums w^ould do well to turn his thoughts 
entirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by 
his own harms, much less by those of other men, to beware; not cooled by 
almost forty years’ miseries and disappointments,— not satisfied with pros- 
perity beyond expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and distress beyond 
imitation. 


I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full liberty has 
to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among the 
prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from England, and 
gone directly to the island; had 1 loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all 
the necessaries for the plantation, and for my people; taken a patent from the 
government here to have secured my property, in subjection only to that of 
England; had I carried over cannon and ammunition, servants and people to 
plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified and strengthened it in the 
name of England, and increased it with people, as I might^ easily have done; had 
I then settled myself there, and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I 
might also have done in six months’ time, and ordered my friends to have fitted 
her out again for our supply,— had I done this, and staid there myself, I had at 
least acted like a man of common sense: but I was possessed of a wandering 
spirit, and scorned all advantages: I pleased myself with being the patron of the 
people I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic way, 
like an old patriarchal monarch, providing for them as if 1 had been father 
of the whole family, as well as of the plantation: but I never so much as pre- 
tended to plant in the name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 287 

any prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation more than another: 
nay, 1 never so much as gave the place a name, but left it as I found it, belonging 
to nobody, and the people under no discipline or government but my own; 
who, though I had influence over them as a father and benefactor, had no 
authority or power to act or command one way or other, farther than voluntary 
consent moved them to comply: yet even this, had I staid there, would have 
done well enough; but as I rambled from them, and came there no more, the 
last letters 1 had from any of them were by my partner’s means, who after- 
wards sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me word, though I had not 
the letter till 1 got to London, several years after it was written, that they went 
on but poorly, were discontent with their long stay there; that Will Atkins was 
dead,— that five of the Spaniards were came away,— and though they had not 
been much molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes with 
them; and that they begged of him to write to me to think of the promise I had 
made to fetch them away, that they might see their country again before they 
died. 

But 1 was gone a wild-goose chase, indeed! and they that will have any more 
of me, must be content to follow me into a new variety of follies, hardships, 
and wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may be duly observed; 
and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make the 
strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish us most severely with those 
very things which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. 
Whether I had business or no business, away I went: it is no time now to en- 
large upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct, but to come to the his- 
tory,—! was embarked for the voyage and the voyage 1 v ent. 

1 shall only add a w^ord or two concerning my honest Popish clergyman,— 
for let their opinions of us, and all other heretics in general, as they call us, be 
as uncharitable as it may, I verily believe this man was very sincere, and wished 
the good of all men: yet 1 believe he was upon the reserve in many of his ex- 
pressions, to prevent giving me offence; for 1 scarce heard him once call on the 
Blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago, or his guardian angel, though so common 
with the rest of them: however, 1 say, I had not the least doubt of his sincerity 
and pious intentions; and 1 am firmly of opinion, if the rest of the Popish mis- 
sionaries were like him, they would strive to visit even the poor Tartans and 
Laplanders, where they have nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to 
India, Persia, China, &c., the most wealthy of the heathen countries; for if they 
expected to bring no gains to their church by it, it may well be admired how 
they came to admit the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Christian 
saints. 

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked me leave to go 
thither; being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he began. 
How happy it had been for me if I had gone with him! But it was too late now: 
all things Heaven appoints for the best: had 1 gone with him, I had never had 
so many things to be thankful for, and the reader had never heard of the second 
part of the travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must here leave ex- 
claiming at myself, and go on with my voyage. From the Brazils, we made di- 



'288 WORKS C«F DANIEL DEFOE 

recc^ over the Atlantic Sea to the Oipe of Good Hope, and had a tolerably 
good voyage, our course generally south-east, now and then a storm, and some 
contrary winds: but my disasters at sea were at an end, —my future rubs and 
cross events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land was as 
well prepared to be our scourge as the sea. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who was to 
direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a cer- 
tain number of days for stay, by charter-party, at the several ports she was to 
go to. This was none of my business, neither did I meddle with it; my neplhew, 
the captain, and the supercargo, adjustmg all those things between them as they 
thought fit. \ 

We staid at the Cape no longer than was needful to take in fresh water, 'but 
made the best of our way for the coast of Coromandel. We were, indeed, in- 
formed that a French man-of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, 
were gone for the Indies, and as I knew we were at war with France, 1 had some 
apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and wc heard no more 
of them. 

I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of places, journals of 
our voyages, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade winds, &c.; it is enough 
to name the ports and places which we touched at, and what occurred to us 
upon our passage from one to another. We touched first at the Island of Mada- 
gascar, where, though the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well 
armed with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet 
we fared very well with them awhile, they treated us very civilly, and for some 
trifles which we gave them, such as knives, scissors, &c., they brought us eleven 
good fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took in partly for fresh pro- 
visions for our present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship’s use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished ourselves with 
provisions; and I, who was always too curious to look into every nook of the 
world wherever 1 came, went on shore as often as I could. It was on the east 
side of the island that we went on shore one evening: and the people, who, by 
the way, are very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us 
at a distance: but as we had treated freely with them, and had been kindly used, 
we thought ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the people, we cut three 
boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance from us; which, it seems, 
is a mark in that country, not only of a truce and friendship, but when it is ac- 
cepted, the other side set up three poles or boughs, which ^s a signal that they 
accept the truce too; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that you 
are not to pass beyond their three poles towards them, nor they to come past 
your three poles, or boughs, towards ypu; so that you are perfectly secure 
within the three poles, and all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed 
IBke a market for free converse, traffic, and commerce. When you go there, ybu 
Jkmst not carry your weapons with you: and if they come into that space, they 
Stick up their javelins and lances all at the first poles, and come on unarmed; 
but if any violence is offered them, and the truce thereby broken, away they 
run to the poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and the truce is at an end. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE i89 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater number of 
their people came down than usual, but all very friendly and civil; and they 
brought several kinds of provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys 
as we had; the women also brought us milk and roots, and several things very 
acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and wc made us a little tent or hut of some 
boughs or trees, and lay on shore all night. 

1 know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well satisfied to lie on 
shore as the rest; and the boat riding at an anchor at about a stone’s cast from 
the land, with two men in her to take care of her, 1 made one of them come on 
shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the 
sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of the branches of the 
trees all night in the boat. 

About two o’clock in the morning, wc heard one of our men make a ter* 
riblc noise on the shore, calling out, for God’s sake, to bring the boat in, and 
come and help them, for they were all like to be murdered; at the same time I 
heard the fire of five muskets, which was the number of guns they had, and that 
three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were not so easily frightened 
with guns as the savages were in America, where 1 had to do with them. All this 
while I knew not what was the matter; but rousing immediately from sleep 
with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three fusees 
we had on board, to land and assist our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too much haste; for 
being come to the shore, they plunged into the water, to get to the boat with all 
the expedition they could, being pursued by between three and four hundred 
men. Our men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with them; 
the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too, three of them 
being very ill wounded; and that which was still worse was, that while we stood 
in the boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger as they were in on 
shore; for they poured their arrows m upon us so thick that we were glad to 
barricade the side of the boat up with the benches, and two or three loose 
boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by mere accident in the boat. 
And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if 
they could have seen but the least part of any of us, they would have been sure 
of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a little sight of them, as they stood 
pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows; and having got ready our fire- 
arms, we gave them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of some of them^ 
had wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle array on the shore till 
break of day, which we supposed was that they might see the better to take 
their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our anchor, or set 
up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as sure 
to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals of 
dipess to the ship, and, though she rode a league off, yet my nephew, the cap-\ 
tain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and tbit 
we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood us; and weighing anchor 



290 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and then 
sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to assist us; but we called to them not 
to come too near, telling them what condition we were in; however, they stood 
in near to us, and one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and 
keeping one boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly 
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to the boat; upon which we 
slipped out a little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of 
reach of the arrows; we all the while lying close behind the barricado we had 
made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, that we dould 
lay her side to the shore, she ran along just by them, and poured in a broadside 
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, 
besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among them. 

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had time to examine into 
the occasion of this fray; and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been often in 
those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not 
have touched us after we had a truce, if we had not done something to provoke 
them to it. At length it came out that an old woman, who had come to sell us 
some milk, had brought it within our poles, and a )’oung woman with her, who 
also brought some roots or herbs; and while the old woman (w hether she w^as 
mother to the young woman or no they could not tell) was selling us the milk, 
one of our men offered some rudeness to the wench that was with her, at which 
the old woman made a great noise: however, the seaman would not quit his 
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight, among the trees, it being 
almost dark; the old woman went away without her, and, as we may suppose, 
made an outcry among the people she came from; who, upon notice, raised this 
great army upon us in three or four hours, and it was great odds but we had all 
been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the beginning 
of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made; the rest came off free, 
all but the fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear 
enough for his black mistress, for we could not hear what became of him for 
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though the wind pre- 
sented, and made signals for him, and made our boat sail up shore and down 
shore several leagues, but in vain; so we were obliged to give him over; and 
if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had been less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on shore once more, 
to try if I could learn anything of him or them: it was the third night after 
the action that I had a great mind to learn, if 1 could by any means, what 
mischief we had done, and how the game stood on the Indians’ side. I was 
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again: but I ought, 
indeed, to have been sure that the men 1 went with had been under my com- 
mand, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as I was 
brought into by it, without design. 

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship, besides the 
supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours before midnight, at the same 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 29t 

pbce where the Indians stood drawn up in die evening before. I landed here, 
because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the 
held, and if they had left any marks behind them of the mischief we had done 
them; and I thought if we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we 
might get our man again, by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bodies, whereof 
the boatswain commanded one, and I the other. We neither saw nor heard 
anybody stir when we landed; and we marched up, one body at a distance 
from the other, to the place; but at first could see nothing, it being very dark; 
till by and by our boatswain, who led the first party, stumbled and fell over 
a dead body. This made them halt awhile; for knowing by the circumstance 
that they were at the place where the Indians had stood, they waited for my 
corping up there. We concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which we 
knew v-ould be in less than an hour, when we could easily discern the havoc 
we had made among them. We told thirty-two bodies upon the ground, 
whereof two were not quite dead; some had an arm, and some a leg shot 
off, and one his head; those that were wounded, we supposed, they had carried 
away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we could come 
to the knowledge of, I resolved on going on board; but the boatswain and his 
party sent me word that they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian 
town, where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along 
with them, and if they^ could find them, as they still fancied they should, they 
did not doubt of getting a good booty; and it might be they might find Tom 
Jeffry there; that was the man’s name we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what answer to 
have given them; for I should have commanded them instantly on board, 
Imowdng it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship and ship-loading 
in our charge, and a voyage to make which depended very much upon the 
lives of the men; but as they sent me word they were resolved to go, and only 
asked me and my company to go along with them, I positively refused it, and 
rose up (for I was sitting on the ground) in order to go to the boat. 6ne or 
two of the men began to importune me to go; and when I refused, began to 
grumble, and say they were not under my command, and they would go. 
“Come, Jack,” says one of the men, “will you go with me? I’ll go for one.” 
Jack said he would,-and then another,~and, in a word, they all left me but 
one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo 
and I, with the third man, went back to the boat, where we told them we 
would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of them as should be 
left; for I told them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed 
most of them would have the fate of Tom Jefiry. 

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come off 
again, and they would take care, &c.; so away they went. I entreated them to 
consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that 
they were intrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, 
the ship might be lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer 



m WOllKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

for it to God or mati. But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the 
ship: they were mad upon their journey; only they gave me good words, and 
bc^ed I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but they would be back 
again in about an hour at farthest; for the Indian town, they said, was not 
above half a mile off, though they found it above two miles before they got 
to it. 

Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate, and such 
as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them their due, they 
went about it as warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had 
every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had proad 
cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain and two mor6 had 
poleaxes; besides all which they had among them thirteen hand grenapoes, 
bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked work ixi the 
world. 

When they went out, their chief design was plunder, and they were in 
mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance which none of them 
were aware of set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them all 

When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had been 
the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under a great dis- 
appointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and where 
the town was, or how big, they knew not. They consulted, therefore, what to 
do, and were some time before they could resolve; for if they fell upon 
these, they must cut all their throats; and it was ten to one but some of them 
might escape, it being in the night, though the moon was up; and if one 
escaped, he would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole 
army upon them: again, on the other hand, if they went away and left those 
untouched (for the people were all asleep), they could not tell which way 
to look for the town: however, the last was the best advice; so they resolved to 
leave them, and look for the town as well as they could. They went on a 
little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they presently concluded, 
would be a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow certainly belonged 
to the town before them, or the town behind them, and if they untied her, 
they should see which way she went: if she went back, they had nothing to 
iay to her; but if she went forward, they would follow her: so they cut the 
cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on before them, 
directly to the town; which, as they reported, consisted of above two hundred 
houses or huts, and in some of these they found several families living together 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure 'as sleep could make 
them: and, first, they called another council, to consider what they had to 
do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide themselves into three bodies, and 
so set three houses on fire in three parts of the town; and as the men came out, 
to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they need not be asked what to 
do then), and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder: but they resolved 
to march silently first through the town, and see what dimensions it was of, 
and if they might venture upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture upon them. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE M 

but while they were animating one another to the work, three of thcnit who 
were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them, and told them, that 
they had found Tom Jeffry; they all ran up to the place, where they found 
the poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was 
an Indian house just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of 
the principal Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with us before, 
and two or three of them wounded with our shot; and our men found thejr 
were awake, and talking one to another in that house, but knew not then: 
number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as before, that 
they swore to one another they would be revenged, and that not an Indian 
that came into their hands should have any quarter; and to work they went 
immediately, and yet not so madly as might be expected from the rage and 
fury they were in. Their first care was to get something that would soon take 
fire, but, after a little search, they found that would be to no purpose; for 
most of the houses were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which the 
country is full; so they presently made some wildfire, as we call it, by wetting 
a little powder in the palm of their hands, and in a quarter of an hour they 
set the town on fire in four or five places, and particularly that house where 
the Indians were not gone to bed. 

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened creatures began to 
rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt; and espe- 
cially at the door, where they drove them back, the boatswain himself killing 
one or two with his poleaxe. The house being large, and many in it, he did 
not care to go in, but called for a hand grenado, and threw it among them, 
which at first frightened them, but, when it burst, made such havoc among 
them that they cried out in a hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians 
who were in the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the grenade^ 
except two or three more who pressed to the door, which the boatswain and 
two more kept, with their bayonets on the muzzles of their pieces, and 
despatched all that came in their way; but there was another apartment in the 
house, where the prince or king, or whatever he was, and several others, were; 
and these were kept in till the house, which was by this time all in a light 
flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not waken the 
people faster than they could master them; but the fire began to waken them 
fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in bod^; 
for the fire grew so raging, all the houses being made of light combustible 
stuff, that they could hardly bear the street between them; and then busine^ 
was to follow the fire, for the surer execution: as fast as the fire either forced 
the people out of those houses which were burning, or frightened ^heni out 
of others, our people were ready at their doors to knock them <m the head, 
still calling and hallooing one to another to remember Tom Jeffry. 

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, ^d especiaUy when 
I saw the flames of the town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by me. 
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men, seeing such a fire, was 



294 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


very uneasy, not knowing what the matter was, or what danger I was in, 
especially hearing the guns too, for by this time they began to use their fire- 
arms; a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the super- 
cargo, what would become or us; and at last, though he could ill spare any 
more men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes another 
boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes ashore to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat with no more 
than two men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet he was Jn the 
same impatience with us to know what was doing; for the noise condlpued, 
and the flame increased; in short, it was next to an impossibility for^ any 
men in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened, or 
their concern for the safety of the men: in a word, the captain told me he 
would go and help his men, let w^hat would come. I argued with him, as I 
did before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, 
the interest of the owners and merchants, &c., and told him I and the two 
men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was likely 
to be the event, and come back and tell him. It was in vain to talk to my 
nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before; he would go, he said; and he only 
wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having 
his men lost for want of help; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and 
his life, and all; and away he went. 

I was no more able to stay behind now, than I was to persuade them not 
to go; so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, 
and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that, 
when they came back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more come 
after us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship^s 
company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the late 
quarrel which brought this mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of the ground we 
trod on: and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to 
the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was surprising to us before, the 
cries of the poor people were now quite of another nature, and filled us with 
horror. I must confess I was never at the sacking of a city, or at the taking a 
town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, 
and killing man, woman, and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the 
city of Magdebourg, and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand, of all 
sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing itself befjorc,. nor is it possible to 
describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds at hearing it. However, we 
went on, and at length came to the town, though there was no entering the 
streets of it for the fire. The first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or 
house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just before 
it, plainly now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three 
women, killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the heap among 
the fire: in short, there were such instances of rage, altogether barbarous, and 
of a fury something beyond what was human, that we thought it impossible 
'OUT men could be guilty of it; or, if they were the authors of it, we thought 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 295 

they ought to be every one of them put to the worst of deaths. But this was 
not all: we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went on just as the 
fire went on; so that we were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a little 
way farther, and beheld, to our astonishment, three naked women, and crying 
in a most dreadful manner, came flying as if they had wings, and after them 
sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and consternation, with 
three of our English butchers in the rear, who, when they could not overtake 
them, fired in among them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down 
in our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we 
would murder them as well as those that pursued them, they set up a most 
dreadful shriek, especially the women; and two of them fell down, as if already 
dead, with fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins, when I 
saw this: and, I believe, had the three English sailors that pursued them come 
on, I had made our men kill them all; however, we took some means to let the 
poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them; and immediately 
they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted up, made 
piteous lamentations to us to save them, which we let them know we would; 
whereupon they crept all together in a huddle close behind us as for protection. 
I left my men drawn up together, and, charging them to hurt nobody, but, if 
possible, to get at some of our people, and see what devil it was possessed 
them, and what they intended to do, and to command them off; assuring them 
that if they staid till daylight they would have a hundred thousand men about 
their ears: I say I left them and went among those flying people, taking only 
two of our men with me; and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among 
them. Some of them had their feet terribly burned with tramping and running 
through the fire; others their hands burned, one of the women had fallen 
down in the fire and was very much burned before she could get out again; 
and two or three of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our 
men pursuing; and another was shot through the body and died while I was 
there, 

1 would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was; but 1 could not 
understand one word they said; though, by signs, I perceived some of them 
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I w^as so terrified in my thoughts 
at this outrageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to my 
own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town, through the fire, 
or whatever might be in the w^ay, and put an end to it, cost what it would; 
accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told them my resolution, and com- 
manded them to follow me, when, at the very moment, came four of our 
men, with the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps of bodies they had 
killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people to 
massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo; and 
with much ado one of them made them hear, so that diey knew who we 
were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a shout of triumph, 
for having, as he thought, more help come; and, without waiting to hear me, 



296 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

*‘Oiptain,” says he, “noble captain! I am glad you are come; we have not 
half done yet. Villanous, hell-hound dogs! FU kill as many of them as poor 
Tom has hairs upon his head: we have sworn to spare none of them; well 
root out the very nation of them from the earth,” and thus he ran on, out 
of breath, too, with action and would not give us leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little, “Barbarous dog^” 
said I, “what are you doing? I won’t have one creature touched more, upon 
pain of death: 1 charge you, upon your life, to stop your hands, and stand still 
nere, or you are a dead man this minute.” “Why, sir,” says he, “do you know 
what you do, or what they have done^^ If you want a reason for what have 
done, come hither;” and with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging,^ with 
his throat cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have been 
forward enough; but I thought they had carried their rage too far, and re- 
membered Jacob’s words to his sons Simeon and Levi. “Cursed be their anger, 
for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel.” But I had now a new 
task upon my hands; for when the men I carried with me saw the sight, as 
I had done, I had as much to do to restrain them as I should have had with 
the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their 
hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the men being overpowered, 
and as to the people, he thought not one of them ought to live, for they had 
all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man, and that they ought 
to be used like murderers. Upon these words, away ran eight of my men, with 
the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work; and I, seeing it 
quite out of my power to restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I 
could not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor 
wretches that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two men, and 
with these walked back to the boat. It was a very great piece of folly in 
me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone, for as it began now to be 
almost day, and the alarm had run over the country, there stood about forty 
men armed with lances and bows, at the little place where the twelve or 
thirteen houses stood, mentioned before; but by accident I missed the place, 
^d came directly to the sea-side, and by the time I got to the sea-side, it 
was broad day: immediately I took the pinnace and went on board, and sent 
her back to assist the men in what might happen. 

I observed, about the time that I came to the boat-sjde, that the fire was 
pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about “half an hour after I got 
on board, I heard a volley of our men’s fire-arms, and saw a great smoke: 
this, as I understood afterwards, was our men falling upon the men, who as 
I said, stood at the few houses on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or 
seventeen, and set all the houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women 
or children. 

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace, our men began 
to appear; they came dropping in, not in two bodies as they went, but strag- 
gling here and there in such a manner, that a small force of resolute men migut 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 297 

have cut them all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole country; 
and the men were surprised, and so frightened, that I believe a hundred of 
them would have fled at the sight of but five of our men; nor in all this 
terrible action was there a man that made any considerable defence; they 
were so surprised between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of 
our men in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves; for 
if they fled one way they were met by one party, if back again, by another: 
so that they were everywhere knocked down; nor did any of our men receive 
the least hurt, except one that sprained his foot, and another that had one 
of his hands burned. 

1 was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed, with all the 
men, in my mind, but with him m particular, as well for his acting so out of 
his duty, as commander of the ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon 
him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his blind men, in 
so bloody and cruel an enterprise My nephew answered me very respectfully, 
but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman wnom they had 
murdered in so cruel and barbarous a manner, he was not master of himself, 
neither could he govern his passion, he owned he wshould not have done so as 
he was commander of the ship, but as he was a man, and nature moved him, 
he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me 
at all, and they knew it well enough, so they took no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it. Our men 
differed in the account of the number they had killed; but according to the 
best of their accounts, put all together, they killed or destroyed about one 
hundred and fifty people, men, women, and children, and left not a house 
standing in the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite 
dead (for his throat was so cut that his head was half off), it would do him 
no service to bring him away; so they only took him down from the tree 
where he was hanging by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it, and I 
always, after that time, told them God would blast the voyage; for I looked 
upon all the blood they shed that night to be murder in them. For though 
it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had 
broken the truce, and had violated a young woman of theirs, who came down 
to them innocently, and on the faith of the public capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards on board. 
He said it was true that we seemed to break the truce, but really had not; and 
that the war was begun the night before by the natives themselves, who had 
shot at us, and killed one of our men without any just provocation; so that as 
we were in a capacity to fight them now, we might also be in a capacity to do 
ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that though the poor 
man had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to have been 
murdered, and that in such a villanous manner; and that they did nothir^ 
but what was just, and what the laws of God allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough to have warned us against 
going on shore amongst heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to make

mankind wise but at their own expense, and their experience seems to be always 
of most use to them when it is dearest bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the coast of 
Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the supercargo’s design 
lay at the Bay of Bengal; where, if he missed his business outward-bound, he 
was to go up to China, and return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, where five of 
our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the gulf, were suri^oundcd 
by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into slavery; the ^rest of 
the boat’s crew were not able to rescue them, and had but just time 'to get 
off their boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven 
in this case; but the boatswain very warmly told me, he thought 1 went 
farther in my censures than 1 could show any warrant for in Scripture; and 
referred to Luke xiii. 4, where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom 
the Tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans; but that 
which put me to silence in the case was, that not one of these five men who 
were now lost were of those who went on shore to the massacre of Mada- 
gascar; so I always called it, though our men could not bear to hear the word 
massacre with any patience. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse consequences 
than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt, 
came up boldly to me one time, and told me he found that 1 brought that 
affair continually upon the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it, and 
had used the men very ill on that account, and himself in particular; that as 1 
was but a passenger, and had no command in the ship, or concern in the 
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know but I might 
have some ill design in my head, and perhaps to call them to an account for 
it when they came to England; and that, therefore, unless I would resolve to 
have done with it, and also not to concern myself any further with him, or 
any of his affairs, he would leave the ship; for he did not think it safe for me 
to sail among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him that I 
confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, and that I 
had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not more upon 
him than any of the rest; that as to having no command in the ship, that was 
true; nor did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my 
mind in things which publicly concerned us all; and what concern I had in 
the voyage was none of his business; that I was a considerable owner in the 
ship. In that claim, I conceived I had a right to speak even further than I had 
done, and would not be accountable to him or any one else, and began to be 
a little warm with him. He made but little reply to me at that time, and I 
thought the affair had been over. We were at this time in the road at Bengal; 
and being willing to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo, in 
the ship’s boat, to divert myself; and towards evening was preparing to go on 
board, when one of the men came to me, and told me he would not have 
me trouble myself to come down to the boat, as he had orders not to carry 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 299 

me on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so 
insolent a message, and I asked the man, who had bade him deliver that 
message to me? He told me the coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, but 
bade him let them know he had delivered his message, and that I had given 
him no answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told him the story, 
adding, what 1 presently foresaw, that there would be a mutiny in the ship; 
and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, 
and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence, for 
before 1 had spoken to him on shore, the matter was effected on board. The 
boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all the inferior officers, as soon as I 
was gone off in the boat, came up, and desired to s}^cak with the captain; 
and there the boatswain, making a long harangue, and repeating all he had 
said to me, told the captain in a few words, that as I was now gone peaceably 
on shore, they were loath to use any violence with me, which, if I had not 
gone on chore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone. 
They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to 
serve in the ship under his command, they would perform it well and faith- 
fully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, 
they w ould all leave the ship, and sail no farther with him; and at that word 
all, he turned his face toward the mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal 
agreed on between them, at which the seamen, being got together there, cried 
out, and all! one and allP^ 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great presence of mind; 
and though he was surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told them 
calmly that he would consider of the matter, but that he could do nothing in 
it till he had spoken to me about it. He used some arguments with them, to 
show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing: but it was all in 
vain; they swore, and shook hands round before his face, that they would 
all go on shore, unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any 
more on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me, and did 
not know how I might take it; so he began to talk smartly to them; told them 
that I was a very considerable owner of the ship, and that, in justice, he 
could not put me out of my own house; that this was next door to serving me 
as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who made a mutiny in the ship, set the 
captain on shore on an uninhabited island, and ran away with the ship; that 
let them go into what ship they would, if ever they came to England again, 
it would cost them very dear; that the ship was mine, and that he could not 
put me out of it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too* 
than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they pleased. However, he 
would go on shore and talk with me, and invited the boatswain to go with 
him, and perhaps they might accommodate the matter with me. But they all 
rejected the proposal, and said they would have nothing to do with me any 
more; and if I came on board, they would all go on shore. “Well,” said the 
captain, “if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with him*”

So away he came to me with this account, a little after the message had been 
brought to me from the coxswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for I was not without 
apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set sail, and run away 
with the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a remote country, having 
nothing to help myself; in short, I had been in a worse case than when I 
was alone in the island. But they had not come to that length, it seems, ifo my 
satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what they had said to hiifi, and 
how they had sworn and shook hands that they would, one and all, leai^ the 
ship, if I was suffered to come on board, I told him he should not be con- 
cerned in it at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired he would take 
care and send me all my necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient 
sum of money, and I would find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but there was no way to help 
it but to comply, so, in short, he went on board the ship again, and satisfied the 
men that his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his 
goods from on board the ship; so that the matter was over in a few hours, 
the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course I should 
steer. 

I was now alone in the most remote part of the world, as I think I may 
call it, for I was near three thousand leagues by sea farther off from England, 
than I was at my island; only, it is true, 1 might travel here by land over the 
Great Mogul’s country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up 
the Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the Desert of Arabia, 
to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland 
into France; and this put together, might at least be a full diameter of the 
globe or more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some English ships, 
which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the Island of Sumatra, and 
get passage on board them for England. But as I came hither without any 
concern with the East India Company, so it would be difficult to go from 
hence without their license, unless with great favor of the captains of the 
sfams, or the company’s factors; and to both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without me; a treatment 
I think a man in my circumstances scarcely ever met with, except from pirates 
running away with a sh^, and setting those that would not agree with their 
villainy on shore. Indeed, this was the next door to It both ways; however, 
my nephew left me two servants, or rather, one companion and one servant; 
the first was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the 
other was his own servant. I took me also a good lodging in the house of an 
Englishwoman, where several merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, 
or rather Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough enter- 
tainedi.|tt|d that I might not be said to run rashly upon anything, I staid here 
abov0 fibe months, considering what course to take, and how to manage my- 
self. i had some English goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of 
my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces-of-eight, and a letter 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 301 

of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever 
might happen. 

1 quickly disposed of my goods to advantage; and, as I originally intended, 
I bought here some very good diamonds, which, of ^1 other things, were die 
most proper for me in my present circumstances, because I could always carry 
my whole estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my return to England, 
but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who lodged with me, 
and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one 
morning. “Countryman,” says he, “I have a project to communicate to yon, 
which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours 
also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you 
by accident, and 1 by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from 
our own country; but it is in a country where, by us, who understand trade 
and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you will put one thousand 
pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the first we can 
get to our minds; you shall be captain, III be merchant, and well go a trading 
voyage to China; for what should we stand still for? The whole world is in 
motion, rolling round and round; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and 
earthly, are busy and diligent; why should we be idle? There are no drones 
in the world but men; why should we be of that number?” 

I liked this proposal very well; and the more so because it seemed to be 
expressed with so much good-will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say 
but that I might, by my loose, unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace 
a proposal for trade, or indeed anything else; otherwise, trade was none of my 
element. However, 1 might perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not 
my element, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing any part of the world 
which I had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to our minds, and 
when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, 
so many as wxre necessary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which 
we should pick up there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a 
gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast men. With these we 
found we could do well enough, having India seamen, such as there were, to 
make up. 

There are so many travellers who have written a history of their voyages 
and travels this way, that it would be very little diversion to anybody to give 
a long account of the places we went to, and the people who inhabit there; 
these things I leave to others, and refer the reader to those journals and travels 
of Englishmen, of which many I find are published, and more promised every 
day; it is enough for me to tell you that we made this voyage to Achin, in the 
Island of Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of 
our wares for opium and some arrack; the first a commodity which bears a 
great price among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was much wanted 
there. In a word, we went up to Suskan, made a very great voyage, were eight 
months out, and returned to Bengal; and I was very well satisfied with my 



302 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

adventure. I observe that our people in England often admire how officers, 
which the Company send into India, and the merchants which generally stay 
there, get such very great estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth 
sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time; but it is no wonder, or at least we 
shall see so much farther into it, when we consider the innumerable ports and 
places where they have a free commerce, that it will be none; and much less 
it will be so when we consider that at those places and ports where the English 
ships come, there is such great and constant demand for the growth of all 
other countries, that there is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market 
abroad for the goods carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much money by first 
adventure, and such an insight into the method of getting more, that had I 
been twenty years younger, 1 should have been tempted to have staid here, 
and sought no farther for making any fortune; but what was all this to a man 
upwards of threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad more in obedi- 
ence to a restless desire of seeing the world than a covetous desire of gaining 
by it} And, indeed, I think it is with great justice I now call it restless desire, 
for it was so. When 1 was at home, 1 was restless to go abroad; and when I was 
abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say, what was this gain to me? I was 
rich enough already, nor had 1 any uneasy desires about getting more money; 
and therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of no great force for the 
prompting me forward to further undertakings: hence, I thought that by this 
voyage 1 had made no progress at all, because I was come back, as 1 might call 
it, to the place from whence I came, as to a home; whereas, my eye, like that 
which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing. I was come into a part 
of the world which I was never in before, and that part, in particular, which 
I had heard much of, and was resolved to see as much of it as I could: and 
then I thought 1 might say I had seen all the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions: I do not name tlus to 
insist on my own, for I acknowledge his were the most just, and the more 
suited to the end of a merchant’s life; who, when he is abroad upon adven- 
tures, is wise to stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is likely to get 
the most money by. My new friend kept himself to the nature of the thing, 
and would have been content to have gone like a carrier’s horse, always to the 
same inn, backward and forward, provided he could, as he called it, find his 
account in it. On the other hand, mine was the motion of a mad, rambling 
boy, that never cares to see a thing twice over. But this, was not all: I had a 
kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled 
resolution imaginable which way to go. In the interval of these consultations, 
my friend, who was always upon the search for business, proposed another 
voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a loading of cloves 
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places, indeed, where the Dutch trade, but 
Islands belonging partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so far, but to 
some other, where they have not the whole power, as they have at Batavia, 
Ceylon, &c. 

We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty was in 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 303 

bringing me to come into it: however, at last, nothing else offering, and finding 
that really stirring about and trading, the profit being so great, and, as I may 
say, certain, had more pleasure in it, and had more satisfaction to my mind, 
than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the unhappicst part of life, I 
resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully, touching at 
Borneo, and several islands whose names I do not remember, and came home 
in about five months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves and nut- 
megs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away to the gulf; and making 
near five of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when he made up this account, smiled at me. “Well, now,” said 
he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, “is not this better 
than walking about here, like a man with nothing to do, and spending our time 
in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans? ” “Why, truly,” says I, 
“my friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of mer- 
chandising; but 1 must tell you,” said I, “by the way, you do not know what 
I am doing; for if I once conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, as 
old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall 
pursue it so eagerly, 1 shall never let you lie still.” 

But, to be short with my speculations, a little v/hile after this there came in 
a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a coaster, not a European trader, of about 
two hundred tons burden; the men, as they pretended, having been so sickly 
that the captain had not hands enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal; 
and having, it seems, got money enough, or being willing, for other reasons, 
to go for Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his ship. This came to 
my ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it; 
so I went to him and told him of it. He considered awhile, for he was no rash 
man neither; but musing some time, he replied, “She is a little too big; but^ 
however, we will have her.” Accordingly, we bought the ship, and agreeing 
with the master, we paid for her, and took possession. When we had done so, 
we resolved to engage the men, if we could, to join with those we had, for 
the pursuing our business; but, on a sudden, they having received not their 
wages, but their share of the money, as we afterwards learned, not one of them 
was to be found: we inquired much about them, and at length were told that 
they were all gone together by land to Agra, the great city of the Mogul’s 
residence, and from thence to travel to Surat, and go by the sea to the Gulf 
of Persia. 

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should imss the 
opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I thought, and in such 
company as would both have guarded and diverted me, would have suited 
mightily with my great design; and I should have both seen the world, and 
gone homeward too, but I was much better satisfied a few days after, when 
I came to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their history was, 
that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the commander; 
that they had been on a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked on 
shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the captain and three of his men; 
and that, after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number, had resolved 



304 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

to run away with the ship, which th^ did, and brought her to Bengal, leaving 
die mate and five men more on shore. 

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by her, as 
we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as 
we ought; for we never inquired anything of the seamen, who would certainly 
haye faltered in their account, contradicted one another, and perhaps contra- 
dicted themselves; somehow or other we should have had reason to have sus- 
pected them; but the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel 
Qostershoven, or some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and\ called 
himself by that name, and we could not contradict him: and withal, having no 
suspicion of the thing, we went through with our bargain. \ 

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some Dwtch; 
and now we resolved on a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c.; 
that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca Isles; and, in short, not to fill 
up this part of my story with trifles, when what is to come is so remarkable, 
I spent, from first to last, six years in this country, trading from port to port, 
backward and forward, and with good success, and was now the last year with 
my new partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to China, 
but designing first to go to Siam, to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and down a great 
while in the Straits of Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner got 
dear of those difficult seas, than we found our ship had sprung a leak, and we 
were not able, by all our industry, to find out where it was. This forced us 
to make some port; and my partner, who knew the country better than I did, 
directed the captain to put into the River of Cambodia; for I had made the 
English mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge 
of the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the great bay or 
^f which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and going often on shore 
for refreshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman; and he was, it 
seems, a gunner’s mate on board an English East India ship, which rode in the 
same river, at or near the city of Cambodia. What brought him hither we 
knew not; but he comes to me, and, speaking English, “Sir,” says he, “you are 
a stranger to me, and 1 to you; but I have something to tell you that very 
nearly concerns you.” 

I look steadfastly at him a good while, and thought at first I had known him; 
but I did not. “If it very nearly concerns me,” said I, “and not yourself, what 
moves you to tell it to me^” “I am moved,” says he, “by 'the imminent danger 
you are in, and, for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it.” “I know no 
oanger I am in,” says I, “but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but 
I intend to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if 1 can find it.” “But, sir,” says 
he, “leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay 
your ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to you. Do 
you know, sir,” said he, “the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up 
this river; and there are two large English ships about five leagues on this side, 
mi three Dutch?” “Well,” said I, “and what is that to me?” “Why, sir,” said he, 
“is it for a man that is upon such adventures as you are, to come into a port, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE SOi; 

and not examine first what ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal 
with them? I suppose you do not think you are a match for them?” I was 
amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it, for I could not con- 
ceive what he meant; and I turned short upon him, and said, “Sir, I wish you 
would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid erf 
any of the Company’s ships, or Dutch ships. I am no interloper. What can ^y 
have to say to me?” He looked like a man half angry and half pleased, ^d 
pausing awhile, but smiling, “Well, sir,” says he, “if you think yourself secure, 
you must take your chance; I am sorry your fate should blind you against 
good advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to sea immediately, you will 
the very next tide be attacked by five long-boats full of men, and perhaps, if 
you are taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined 
afterwards. I thought, sir,” added he, “I should have met with a better recep- 
tion than this, for doing you a piece of service of such importance.” “I can 
never be ungrateful,” said I, “for any service, or to any man that offers me any 
kindness; but it is past my comprehension what they should have such a design 
upon me for; however, since you say there is no time to be lost, and that there 
is some villanous design on hand against me, 1 will go on board this minute, 
and put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim 
without stopping it, but, sir,” said I, “shall I go away ignorant of the cause 
of all this? Can you give me no further light into it?” “I can tell you but part 
of the story, sir,” says he, “but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I 
believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for 
it; but the short of the story is this, the first part of which I suppose you know 
well enough, that you were with this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain 
was murdered by the Malays, with three of his men; and that you, or some 
of those that were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are since 
turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as 
pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very little ceremony; for yon 
know merchant ships show but little law to pirates, if they get them into their 
power.” “Now you speak plain English,” said 1, “and I thank you; and thou^ 

1 know nothing that we have done like what you talk of,— for I am sure we 
came honestly and fairly by the ship,— yet seeing such a work is doing, as you 
say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard.” “Nay, 
sir,” says he, “do not talk of being upon your guard; the best defence is, to be 
out of the danger. If you have any regard for your life, and the lives of all your 
men, put to sea without fail at high water; and as you have a whole tide brfore 
you, you will be gone too far out before they can come down; for they wUl 
come away at high water, and as they have twenty miles to come, you will get 
near two hours of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length 
of the way; besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they will not venture 
to follow you far out to sea, especially if it blows.” “Well,” said I, “you have 
been very kind in this: what shall I do for you to make you amends?” “Sir,” 
says he, “you may not be willing to make me any amends, because you may 
not be convinced of the truth of it. I will make an offer to you. I have nine- 
teen months’ pay due to me on board the ship — , which I came out of Er^- 



306 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

land in; and the Dutchman that is with me has seven months’ pay due to him. 
If you will make good our pay to us, we will go along with you; if you find 
nothing more in it, we will desire no more; but if we do convince you that 
we have saved your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, 
we will leave the rest to you.” 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and the two men 
with me. As soon as I catne to the ship’s side, my partner, who was on board, 
came out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great deal of joy, 
“O ho! O ho! we have stopped the leak—we have stopped the leak!” “Sayf you 
so?” said I; “thank God! but weigh anchor, then, immediately.” “Weigh!” 
says he; “what do you mean by that? What is the matter?” “Ask no questimis,” 
said I; “but all hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute.” He Was 
surprised; but, however, he called the captain, and he immediately ordered the 
anchor to be got up; and though the tide was not quite down, yet a little Und 
breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then 1 called him into the cabin, and told 
him the story; and we called in the men, and they told us the rest of it; but 
as it took up a great deal of time, before we had done, a seaman comes to the 
cabin door, and called out to us that the captain bade him tell us we were 
chased. “Chased,” says I; “by what?” “By five sloops, or boats,” says the fellow, 
“full of men.” “Very well,” said I, “then it is apparent there is something in it.” 
In the next place, 1 ordered all our men to be called up, and told them there 
was a design to seize the ship, and take us for pirates, and asked them if they 
would stand by us, and by one another; the men answered cheerfully, one and 
all, that they would live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way 
he thought best for us to manage a fight with them; for resist them I was 
resolved we would, and that to the last drop. He said readily, that the way 
was to keep them off with our great shot as long as we could, and then to fire 
at them with our small-arms, to keep them from boarding us: but when neither 
of these would do any longer, we would retire to our close quarters; perhaps 
they had not materials to break open our bulkheads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring two guns to bear fore 
and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and load them with musket bul- 
lets and small pieces of old iron, and what came next to hand; and thus we 
made ready for fight: but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind enough, 
and could see the boats at a distance, being five large long-boats, following us 
with all the sail they could make. 

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were English) out- 
sailed the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us con- 
siderably, so that we found they would come up with us; upon which we fired 
a gun without ball, to intimate that they should bring to: and we put out a 
flag of truce, as a signal for parley: but they came crowding after us, till they 
came within shot, when we took in our white flag, they having made no 
answer to it, and hung out a red flag, and fired at them with a shot. Notwith- 
standing this, they came on till they were near enough to call to them with 
a ^eakmg-trumpet which we had on board; so we called to them, and bade 
them keep off at their peril. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 307 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavored to come under our 
stem, so as to board us on our quarter; upon which, seeing they were resolute 
for mischief, and depended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered 
to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside; when immediately 
we fired five guns at them, one of which had been levelled so true as to carry 
away the stern of the hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity of 
taking down their sail, and running all to the head of the boat, to keep her 
from sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost 
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular. While this 
was doing, one of the three boats that was behind, being forwarder than the 
other two, made up to the boat u hich we had disabled, to relieve her, and we 
could see her take out the men; we called again to the foremOvSt boat, and 
offered a truce, to parley again, and to know what her business was with us; 
but had no answer, only she crowded close under our stern. Upon this, our 
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two chase-guns, and 
fired again at her; but tlie shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved 
their caps, and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired 
among them a second time, one shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, 
yet fell in among the men, and we could easily see had done a great deal of 
mischief among them; but we took no notice of that, wore the ship again, and 
brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing three guns more, we found 
the boat was almost split to pieces; in particular, her rudder and a piece of her 
stern were shot quite away; so they handed her sail immediately, and were in 
great disorder. But, to complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns 
at them again; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat was 
sinking, and some of the men already in the water: upon this, 1 immediately 
manned out our pinnace, which we kept close by our side, with orders to pick 
up some of the men, if they could, and save them from drowning, and immedi- 
ately come on board ship with them, because we saw the rest of the boats 
began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and took up 
three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a good while before 
we could recover him. As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the 
sail we could make, and stood farther out to sea; and we found that when the 
other three boats came up to the first, they gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I knew not the reason of 
it, yet seeilied to be much greater than I apprehended, I resolved that we should 
change our course, and not let any one know whither we were going; so we 
stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European ships, whether 
they were bound to China or anywhere else, within the commerce of the 
European nations. 

When we were at sea, we began to consult with the two seamen, and inquire 
what the meaning of all this should be; and the Dutchman let us into the secret 
at once, telling us that the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more 
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he told us that the captain, 
whose name too he told us, though I do not remember it now, was treacher- 
ously murdered by the natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his men, 



308 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


—and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where they 
wandered about a great while, till at length he, in particular, in a miraculous 
manner, made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, which, sailing near 
the shore in its way from China, had sent their boat on shore for fresh water, 
—that he durst not come to that part of the shore where the boat was, but made 
a shift in the night to take the water farther off, and, swimming a great while, 
at last the ship's boat took him up. > 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen belqnging 
to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels, and gave ^ ac- 
count that the fellow who had run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a 
set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising in her, and that they had alrpady 
taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us directly, though we knew it t6 be 
false; yet, as my partner said very justly, if we had fallen into their hands, and 
they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it had l)een in vain 
for us to defend ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their hands, 
—and especially, considering that our accusers had been our judges, and that 
we could have expected nothing from them but what rage would have dic- 
tated, and an ungoverned passion have executed; and therefore it was his opin- 
ion we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, without 
putting in at any port whatever,— because there we could gi\c a good account 
of ourselves, could prove where we were when the ship put in, of whom we 
bought her, and the like; and, what was more than all the rest, if we were put 
upon the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure 
to have some justice and not to be hanged first, and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner’s opinion; but after a little more serious think- 
ing, I told him I thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt returning 
to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and 
that if the alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every side, as 
well by the Dutch at Batavia as the English elsewhere; that if we should be 
taken, as it were running away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there 
would want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English sailor’s 
opinion, who said he was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken. 
This danger a little startled my partner, and all the ship’s company, and wc 
at once resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast 
of China, and, pursuing the first design as to trade, find^ some way or other 
to dispose of the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the country, such 
as we could get. This was approved of as the best method for our security; and 
accordingly we steered away N. N. E., keeping above fifty leagues off from 
the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put us to some inconvenience, 
—for, first, the winds, when we came that distance from the shore, seemed to 
be more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as wc call it, from the E. 
and E. N. E., so that we were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but 
iU provided with victuals for so long a run,— and what was still worse, there 
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, 
whereof some were bound that way, might have got in before us, and if not, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 309 

some other ship bound to China might have information of us from them, and 
pursue us with the same vigor, 

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, including the 
late escape from the long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous condition 
that ever I was in through my past life; for whatever ill circumstances I had 
been in, 1 was never pursued for a thief before; nor had I ever done anything 
that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less tliicvish; I had 
chiefly been my own enemy, or, as 1 may rightly say, I had been nobody’s 
enemy but my own; bur now I was embarrassed in the worst condition imagi- 
nable; for though 1 was perfectly innocent, i was in no condition to make that 
innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt 
of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to make an escape, though 
which way to do it I knew not, or what port or place we could go to. My part- 
ner, seeing me thus dejected, though he was the most concerned at first, began 
to encourage me, and describing to me the several ports of that coast, told me 
he would put in on the coast of Cochin China, or the Bay of Tonquin, intend- 
ing afterwards to go to Macao, a town once in possession of the Portuguese, 
and where still a great many European families resided— and particularly the 
missionary priests usually went thither in order to their going forward to 
China. 

Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though after a tedious and 
irregular course, and very much straitened for provisions, we came within 
sight of the coast very early in the morning; and upon reflection on the past 
circumstances we were in, anej the danger if we had not escaped, we resolved 
to put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of water for us, 
and to see if we could, cither over land or by the ship’s pinnace, come to know 
what ships were in any port thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed, our 
deliverance; for though we did not immediately see any European ships in the 
Bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch 
ships; and a third, without any colors spread out, but which we believed to be 
a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues’ distance, steering for the coast of 
China, and in the afternoon went by two English ships steering the same course; 
and thus wc thought we saw ourselves beset w ith enemies both one way and 
the other. The place wc were in w^as wild and barbarous— the people thieves, 
even by occupation or profession; and though, it is true, we had not much 
to seek of them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not how little we 
had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that we kept ourselves 
from being insulted by them several ways. We were in a small river of this 
country within a few leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by our boat 
we coasted north-east, to the point of land wffiich opens the great Bay of Ton- 
quin; and it was in this beating up along shore that we discovered that we were 
i»urrounded with enemies. The people wc were among were the most barbarous 
of all the inhabitants of the coast, having no correspondence with any other 
nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross commodities; and it 
niay be particularly seen that they are the most barbarous of any of the inhabit- 
ants. Among other customs, they have this one, -that if any vessel has the mis- 



310 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


fortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently make the men all 
prisoners or slaves; and it was not long before we found a piece of their kind- 
ness this way, on the occasion following. 

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak at sea, and that we could 
not find it out; and it happened that, as I have said, it was stopped unexpect- 
edly, in the happy minute of our being to be seized by the Dutch and English 
ships in the Bay of Siam; yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly tight and 
sound as we desired, we resolved, while we were at this place, to lay ,her on 
shore, and take out what heavy things we had on board, and clean her bottom, 
and, if possible, to find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having light- 
ened the ship, and brought all our guns and other movables to one siie, we 
tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom, but, on second 
thoughts, wx did not care to lay her on dry ground, neither could we find out 
a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a sight, came 
wondering down to the shore to look at us; and seeing the ship lie dowm on one 
side in such a manner, and heeling m towards the shore, and not seeing our 
men, who were at work on her bottom with stages, and w ith their boats on the 
off-side, they presently concluded that the ship w as cast aw ay, and lay fast 
on the ground. On this supposition, they all came about us, in two or three 
hours’ time, wdth ten or twehe large boats, having some of them eight, some 
of them ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to ha\ c conic on board and 
plundered the ship, and if they found us there, to haNC carried us away for 
slaves to their king, or whatever they call him, for we knew nothing of their 
governor. 

When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, they discov- 
ered us all hard at w'ork on the outside of the ship’s bottom and side, washing, 
and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man knows how. They stood for 
a while ga/ing at us, and we, who were a little surprised, could not imagine 
what their design w as; but being willing to be sure, we took this opportunit)' 
to get some of us into the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition 
to those w^ho were at work, to defend themselves with, if there should be occa- 
sion; and it was no more than need,— for in less than a quarter of an hour’s 
consultation, they agreed, it seems, thit the ship was really a wreck, and that 
we were all at work endeavoring to save her, or to save our lives by the help 
of our boats; and wdicn wx handed our arms into the boat, they concluded, 
by that motion, that we were endeavoring to save some of our goods: upon 
this, they took it for granted we all belonged to them; and away they came 
directly upon our men, as if it had been in a linc-of-battle. 

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we lay but in 
an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what they should do. I im- 
mediately called to the men that worked upon the stages, to slip them down, 
and get up the side into the ship, and bade tho.se in the boat to row round and 
come on board; and the few who were on board worked with all the strength 
and hands we had to bring the ship to rights; but, however, neither the men 
upon the stages nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered, before 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 311 

the Cochin Chinese were upon them; and two of their boats boarded our long- 
boat, and began to lay hold of our men as their prisoners* 

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout, strong fel- 
low, who, having a musket in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down 
in the boat, like a fool, as 1 thought; but he understood his business better than 
I could teach him, for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by main force 
out of their boat into ours, where, taking him by the'ears, he beat his head 
so against the boat’s gunnel, that the fellow died in his hands; and, in the mean 
time, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and with the butt-end 
of it so laid about him, that he knocked down five of them who attempted to 
enter the boat. But this w^as doing little towards resisting thirty or forty men, 
who, fearless because ignorant of their danger, began to throv/ themselves into 
the long-boat, w here w e had but five men in ail to defend it; but the following 
accident, which deserved our laughter, gave our men a complete victory. 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as well as to 
pay the seams whcie he had calked her to sto]> the leaks, had got tw^o kettles 
)ust let dowm into the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with 
rosin, tallowy oil, and such stuff as the shipwTights use for that work; and the 
man that attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with w^hich 
he supplied the men that were at work with the hot stuff. Two of the enemy’s 
men entered the boat ]ust w here this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he 
immediately saluted them with a iadleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so 
burned and scalded them, being half-naked, that they roared out like bulls, 
and, enraged with the fire, lca[)cd both into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and 
cried out, “Well done, Jack’ give them some more of it;” and stepping for- 
ward himself, takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch- pot, he and 
his man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in sliort, of all the men in 
the three boats, there was not one that escaped being scalded and burned with 
it, in a most frightful, pitiful manner, and made such a howding and crying, 
that 1 never heard a worse noise; for it is worth observing, that though pain 
naturally makes all people call out, yet every nation has a particular way of 
exclamation, and makes a noise as different one from another as their speech* 
I cannot give the noise these creatures made a better name than howling, nor 
a name more proper to the tone of it; for I never heard anything more like the 
noise of the wolves, which, as 1 have said, 1 heard howl in the forest on the 
frontiers of Languedoc. 

1 was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not only as it was a 
perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was imminent before, but as we 
got this victory w ithout any bloodshed, except of that man the fellow killed 
with his naked hands, and wdiich 1 was very much concerned at; for I 
was sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in my 
own defence, knowing they came on errands which they thought just, and 
knew no better; and that, though it may be a just thing, because necessary 
(for there is no necessary wdekedness in nature), yet I thought it was a sad 
iife, when we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow'-creaturcs to pre- 
serve ourselves; and, indeed, 1 think so still; and I would even now suffer a

|[reat deal, rather than I would take away the life even of the worst person 
mjuring me; and I believe all considering people, who know the value of life, 
would be of my opinion if they entered seriously into the consideration of it. 

But to return to my story;— All the while this was doing, my partner and 1, 
who managed the rest of the men on board, had with great dexterity brought 
the ship almost to rights, and having got the guns into their places again, the 
gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly 
among them. I called back again to him, and bade him not oflFer to fire, jfor the 
carpenter would do the work without him; but bid him heat another^ pitch- 
kettle, which our cook, who was on board, took care of; but the enemy ^as so 
terrified with what they had met with in their first attack, that they would not 
come on again; and some of them, who were farthest off, seeing the ship swim, 
as it were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see their mistake, and gave over 
the enterprise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this 
merry fight; and having got some rice, and some roots and bread, with about 
sixteen hogs, on board, two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer, 
but go forward, whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be 
surrounded the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch- 
kettle would dispose of for us. We therefore got all our things on board the 
same evening, and the next morning were ready to sail: in the mean time, 
lying at anchor at some distance from the shore, we were not so much con- 
cerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any 
enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our work within board, 
and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We 
would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves 
of what w^as to be known concerning the Dutch ships that had been there; but 
we durst not stand in there, because we had seen several ships go in, as vc 
supposed, but a little before; so we kept on N. E., tow^ards the island of For- 
mosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a 
Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man- 
of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. F., as if we w^mld go to the 
Manillas or the Philippines Islands; and this we did that we might not fall into 
the way of any of the European ships; and then we steered north, till we came 
to the latitude of 22 degrees 30 minutCsS, by which means we made the Island 
of Formosa directly, where wc came to an anchor, in order to get water and 
fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very Courteous and civil in 
their manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually 
with us in all their agreements and bargains; which is what we did not find 
among other people, and may be owing to the remains of Christianity which 
was once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testimony 
of what I have often obscr\ed, \i7.: that the Christian religion always civilizes 
the people and reforms their manners, where it is received, whether it works 
saving effects upon them or no. 

From thence wc sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an equal 
distance, till we knew wc were beyond all the ports of China where out 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 313 

European ships usually come; being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any 
of their hands, especially in this country; where, as our circumstances were, 
we could not fail of being entirely ruined. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved to put into 
the first trading port we should come at; and standing in for the shore, a boat 
came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who, 
knowing us to be a European ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, 
we were glad of, and took him on board; upon which, without asking us 
whither wc would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old man carry 
us whither w^c would, that 1 began to talk to him about carrying us to the 
Gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the coast of China. The 
old man said he knew the Gulf of Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked us 
what wc would do there^ I told him wc would sell our cargo and purchase 
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c.; and so would return 
by the same course we came. He told us our best port would have been to 
put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a market for our opium 
to our satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased all sorts of 
China goods as cheap as wc could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was very 
opinionated or conceited, I told him wc were gentlemen as well as merchants, 
and that we had a mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the famous 
court of the monarch of China. “Why, then,” says the old man, “you should 
go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you may 
go up within five leagues of the great canal. This canal is a navigable stream, 
which goes through the heart of that vast empire of China, crosses all the 
rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes 
up to the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred and seventy leagues.” 

“Well,” said I, “Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our business now; the 
great question is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence 
we can travel to Pekin afterwards^” He said he could do so very well, and 
that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way )ust before. This gave 
me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we would have 
much rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in too frightful a 
figure, and wc depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, 
for wc were in no condition to fight them; all the ships they trade with into 
those parts being of great burden, and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern, when 
he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, “Sir, you need be under no appre- 
hensions of the Dutch; I supjiose they are not now at war with your nation?” 
“No,” said I, “that’s true, hut 1 know not what liberties men may take when 
they are out of the reach of the laws of their own country.” “Why,” says he, 
“you are no pirates, what need you fear^ They wiU not meddle with peaceable 
merchants, sure.” 

If 1 had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at that 
^vord, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to cir- 



314 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


culatc it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion imaginable* 
nor was it possible for me to conceal it so; but the old man easily perceived 

it. 

“Sir,” says he, “I find you arc in some disorder in your thoughts at my talk; 
pray be pleased to go which wav you think fit, and depend upon it, I’ll do you 
all the service I can.” “Why, seignior,” said i, “it is true 1 am a little unsettled 
in my resolution, at this time, whither to go in particular; and 1 am something 
more so for m hat you said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates ^n these 
seas. Wc are but in ill condition to meet with them, for you sec we haVe but a 
small force, and arc but very weakly manned.” “O, sir,” says he, “obn’t be 
concerned; I do not know that there have been any pirates in these se^s these 
fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as 1 hear, in the Bay of Siam, about 
a month since; but you may be assured she has gone tt) the southward; nor was 
she a ship of any great force, or fit for the work. She was not built for a 
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crefw that was on board, after 
the captain and some of his men had been murdered by the Malayans, at or 
near the Island of Sumatra.” “What,” said T, seeming to know nothing of the 
matter, “did they murder the captain?” “No,” said he, “1 don’t understand 
that they murdered him; but, as they afterwards ran away with the ship, it is 
generally believed that they betrayed him into the hands of the Malayans, who 
did murder him, and perhaps they procured them to do it.” “Wliy, then,” said 
I, “they deserve death as much as if they had done it themselves.” “Nav,” 
says the old man, “they do deserve it; and they will certainly have it, if the\ 
light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed together, that 
if they meet that rogue, they’ll give him no quarter.” “But,” said I to him, 
“you say the pirate is gone out of these seas: how can they meet with him 
then?” “Why, that’s true,” says he, “tlicy do say so; but he w^as, as I tell you, 
in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cambodia, and w as discovered there by some 
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore wlien thc} 
ran away with her; and some English and Dutch traders being in the river, 
they were within a little of taking him; nay,” said he, “if the foremost boats had 
been well seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken him; but he, finding 
only two boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at those two, and 
disabled them before the others came up, and then standing off to sea, the 
others were not able to follow, and so he got aw'ay; but they have all so exact 
a description of the ship, that they will be sure to know her; and wherever they 
find her, they have vowed to give no quarter cither to the caj)tain or seamen, 
but to hang them all up at the yardarm.” “What!” said 1, “will they execute 
them, right or wrong; hang them first, and judge them afterw^ards? ” “O, sir,” 
says the old pilot, “there is no need to make a formal business of it with such 
rogues as those; let them tie them back to back, and set them a diving— ’tis 
no more than they deserve.” 

I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could do no harm, so 
that I turned short upon him. “Well, now, seignior,” said I, “this is the very 
reason why 1 would have you carry us up to Nanquin, and not put back to 
Macao, or to any other part of the country where the English or Dutch ships 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 315 

come; for be it known to you, seignior, those captains of the English and 
Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know 
what belongs to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God and 
nature direct; but being proud of their offices, and not understanding their 
power, they would act the murderers to punish robbers; would take upon them 
ro insult men falsely accused, and determine them guilty without due inquiry; 
and perhaps I may live to bring some of them to account for it, when they 
may be taught how justice is to be executed; and that no man ought to be 
treated as a criminal till some evidence n)ay be had of the crime, and that he 
is the man.” 

With this I told him that this was the very ship they attacked, and gave him 
a full account of the skirmish we had with their boats, and how^ foolishly and 
cowardly they behaved. 1 told him all the story of our buying the ship, and 
how the Dutchmen served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe the story 
of killing the master by tPhe Malayans was true, as also the running away with 
the ship; but it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men had 
turned pirates, and they ought to have been sure it was so before they ventured 
to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them; adding that they would 
liave the blood of those men v\hom we killed there in just defence to answer 
for. 

The old man was aitiaz-cd at this relation, and told us w^e were very much in 
the right to go away to the north; and that if he might advise us, it should be 
to sell the ship in China, which v^e might very ’s^ell do, and buy or build an- 
other in the country. “And,” said he, “though you will not get so good a 
ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods back 
again to Bengal, or anywhere else.” 1 told him 1 would take his advice when 
I came to any port where 1 could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer 
to buy this. He replied 1 should meet with customers enough for the ship at 
Nancjuin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go back again; 
and that he would procure me people both to buy one and sell the other. 
“Well, but, seignior,” said I, “as you say they know the ship so w^ell, I may, 
})crhaps, if 1 follow your measures, be instrumental to bring some honest, inno- 
cent men into a terrible broil, and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood; for 
wherever they find the ship they w ill prove the guilt upon the men, by proving 
this was the ship; and so innocent men may probably be overpowered and 
murdered.” “Why,” says the old man, “riffind out a way to prevent that 
also; for as I know all those commanders you speak of very well, and shall see 
them all as they pass by, 1 wdll be sure to set them at rights in the thing, and 
let them know that they had been so much in the wTong; that though the 
people who were on board at first might run aw^ay with the ship, yet it was 
not true that they had turned pirates; and that, in particular, these were not 
the men that first went off with the ship, but innocently bought her for their 
trade; and I am persuaded they will so far believe me, as at least to act more 
cautiously for the time to come.” 

While these things were passing between us by way of discourse, we went 
forward directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days’ sail came to an 



316 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

anchor, at the southwest point of the great Gulf of Nanquin; where, by the 
way, I came by accident to understand that two Dutch ships were gone the 
length before me, and that I should certainly fall into their hands. I consulted 
my partner again in this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and 
would very gladly have been safe on shore almost anywhere: however, I was 
not in such perplexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no creek 
or harbor which I might put into and pursue my business with the Chinese 
privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He told me if I would sail to the 
southward about forty-two leagues, there was a little port called QiiiAchang, 
where the fathers of the mission usually landed from Alacao, on their progress 
to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and where no Furopean ships 
ever put in; and if I thought to put in there, I might consider what further 
course to take when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it w’as not a place 
for merchants, except that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair there, 
when the merchants from Japan came over thithcri^to buy Chinese merchan- 
dises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place* the name of the port, as he called it, 
I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particularly remember it, having lost 
this, together with the names of many other places set down in a little pocket- 
book, which was spoiled by the water by an accident; but this I remember- 
that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we corresponded with called it by a 
different name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced 
it as above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed 
the next day, having only gone twice on shore, where we were, to get fresh 
water; on both which occasions the people of the country were very civil to 
us, and brought abundance of things to sell to us, 1 mean of provisions, plants, 
roots, tea, nee, and some fowls; but nothing without money. 

We did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary) for five davs, 
but it was very much to our satisfaction; and 1 was joyful, and 1 may sa> 
thankful, when I set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner too, that if 
it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, though nor 
every way to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot on board that 
unhappy vessel more; and, indeed, I must acknowledge, that of all the circum- 
stances of life that ever I had any experience of, nothing makes mankind so 
completely miserable as that of being in constant fear. Well does the Scripture 
say, “The fear of man brings a snare:” it is a life of de^th, and the mind is so 
entirely oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by heightening every 
danger; representing the English and Dutch captains to be men incapable of 
hearing reason, or of distinguishing between honest men and rogues; or be- 
tween a story calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to 
deceive, and a true, genuine account of our whole voyage, progress, and design, 
for we might many ways have convinced any reasonable creatures that we were 
not pirates: the goods we had on board, the course we steered, our frankly 
showing ourselves, and entering into such and such ports; and even our very 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 317 

manner, the force we had, the number of men, the few arms, the little ammuni- 
tion, short provisions; all these would have served to convince any men that 
we were no pirates. The opium and other goods we had on board would 
make it appear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it was said, 
had the names of all the men that were in the ship, might easily see that we 
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and hut two Dutchmen 
on board. These, and many other particular circumstances, might have made it 
exident to the understanding of any commander, whose hands we might fall 
into, that we were no pirates. But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked an- 
other way, and threw us into the va})ors: it bewildered our understandings, and 
sei the imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that perhaps 
might never happen. We first supposed (as indeed everybody had related to 
us) that the seamen on hoard the English and Dutch ships, but especially the 
r>utch, were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our beating 
ofi their boats and escaping, that they would not give themsches leave to 
inquire whether we v ere pirates or no, but would execute us off hand, without 
giving us any room for a defence. Wc reflected that there really was so much 
apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce inquire after any more; 
as, first, that the ship was certainly the same, and that some of the seamen 
among them knew her, and 1 had been on board her; and, secondly, that when 
ue had intelligence at the River of Cambodia that they were coming down to 
examine us, we fought their boats and fled; so that we made no doubt but they 
were as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were satisfied of the con- 
irary, and, as I often said, I know not hut I should have been apt to have 
taken those circumstances for evidence, if the tables were turned, and my case 
was theirs; and have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without 
believing, or perhaps considering, what they might have to offer in their 
defence. 

But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions; and both my 
partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms» 
that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken; of killing, and being 
lAilled, and one night 1 was in such a fury in my dream, fanc}dng the Dutchmen 
had hoarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck 
my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in with such a force as 
wounded my hand grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the 
flesh, so that it awakened me out of my sleep. 

Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage w e might meet with from 
them if wx fell into their hands: then the story of Amboyna came into my 
head, and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our country- 
men there, and make some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those 
crimes they never were guilty of, or owm themselves and all of us to be pirates, 
and so they would put us to death wdth a formal appearance of justice; and that 
they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo, which 
were w^orth four or five thousand pounds altogether. 

These things tormented me, and my partner too, night and day; nor did we 
consider that the captains of ships have no authority to act thus; and if wc had 



318 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


surrendered prisoners to them, they would not answer the destroying us, or 
torturing us, but would be accountable for it when they came to their coun- 
try; this, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for if they were to act thus with us, 
what advantage would it be to us that they should be called to an account for 
it? or if we were first to be murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to 
have them punislicd when they came home? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had upon the vast 
variety of my particular circumstances, how hard 1 thought it was tha^ I, who 
had spent forty years in a life of continual difficulties, and was at last come, 
as it were, to the })orr or haven which all men drive at, viz.: to havcirest and 
plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy \:hoice; 
and that 1, who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should now come 
to be hanged in niy old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime which I was 
not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in; and I would be 
considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence, 
and 1 ought to look upon it and submit to it as such, that although I was 
innocent as to men, 1 was far from being innocent as to my Maker; and I 
ought to look in and examine >vhat other crimes in my life were most obvious 
to me, and which Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribu- 
tion; and that I ought to submit to this, just as 1 would to a shipwreck, if it 
had pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place, and then I would 
be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that 1 would not be taken, to be 
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in cold blood; that it were 
much better to have fallen into the hands of the savages, though 1 was sure 
they would feast upon me when they had taken me, than those who would 
perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities; that in 
the case of the savages, I always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and 
why should I not do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me at 
least, to think of falling into these men’s hands, than ever it was to think of 
being eaten by men^ for the savages, give them their due, would not eat a man 
till he was killed and dead, but that these men had many arts beyond the 
cruelty of death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself 
into a kind of fever with the agitation of a supposed fight; my blood would 
boil, and my e)es sparkle, as if I was engaged, and I was always resolved to 
take no quarter at their hands; but even, at last, if I could resist no longer, 
I would blow up the ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these things were to our 
thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our satisfaction when we saw 
ourselves on shore; and my partner told me he dreamed that he had a very 
heavy load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found that 
he was not able to stand longer under it; but that the Portuguese pilot came 
and took it off his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before him ap- 
pearing all smooth and plain: and truly it was so; they were all like men who 



319 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 

had a load taken off their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off from 
niy heart that it was not able any longer to bear; and as 1 said above, we re- 
solved to go no more to sea in that ship. When wc came on shore, the old pilot, 
who was now our friend, got us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods, 
which, by the way, was much the same; it was a little house, or hut, with a 
larger house adjoining to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with 
large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there wxre not a 
few in that country: however, the magistrates allowed us a little guard, and 
wc had a soldier with a kind of halberd, or half pike, who stood sentinel at our 
door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, about 
the value of threepence, per day, so that our goods were kept very safe. 

The fair, or mart, usually kept at tliis place, had been over some time: how- 
ever, wc found that there were three or four junks in the river, and two Japan- 
ners (I mean ships from Japan) with goods which the\ had bouglit in China, 
and were not gone aw^ay, having some Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us w as to get us acquainted 
wuth three missionary Romish priests who w ere in the tow n, and wdio had been 
there some time com erting the people to Christianit) ; but we thought they 
made but poor work of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they had 
done: however, that was none of our business. One of these was a I'renchman, 
whom they called Father Simon; another was a Portuguese, and the third a 
Genoese; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agree- 
able company; the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, 
and applied seriously to the work they came about, \iz.: to talk with and in- 
sinuate themselves among the inhabitants, wdicrever they had opportunity. 
Wc often ate and drank with those men; and though, 1 must confess, the 
conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the 
true conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, that 
it seems to amount to little more than Icuing them know^ the name of Christ, 
and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they 
understand not, and to cross themselves and the like; yet it must be con- 
fessed that the religionists, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief that 
these people will be saved, and that they are the instruments of it; and on this 
account, they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage, and the hazards 
of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, and the most violent tor- 
tures, for the sake of this w'^ork. 

But to return to my story: This French priest. Father Simon, was appointed, 
it seems, by order of" the chief of the mission to go up to Pekin, the royal seat 
of the Chinese emperor, and w^aited only for another priest, who was ordered 
to come to him from Macao, to go along with him, and we scarce ever met 
together but he was inviting me to go that journey; telling me how he would 
show me all the glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among the rest, 
the greatest city in the world— “A city,” said he, “that your London and our 
Paris put together cannot be equal to.” This was the city of Pekin, which, 
I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of people; but as I looked on those 
things with different eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them 



320 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

in a few words, when I come in the course of my travels to speak more 
particularly of them. 

But first I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one day, and 
being very merry together, I showed some little inclination to go with him; 
and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a great many per- 
suasions, to consent. “Why, Father Simon,” says my partner, “should you 
desire our company so much? You know we are heretics, and you do not love 
us, nor cannot keep us company with any pleasure.” “O,” says he, “you ma} 
perhaps be good Catholics in time; my business here is to convert heathens, 
and who knovs but I may convert you too?” “Very well, Father,” saia I, “so 
you will preach to us all the w ay?” “1 will not be troublesome to you,” savb 
he; “our religion does iKJt divest us of good manners; besides, we are here like 
countrymen; and so we are, compared to the place we are in; and if you are 
Huguenots, and 1 a Catholic, wc may all be Christians at last, at least, we arc 
all gentlemen, and w e may converse so, without being uneasy to one another.” 
I liked this part of his discourse very well, and it began to put me in mind of 
my priest that I had left in the Brazils; but this Father Simon did not come 
up to his character by a great deal; for though Father Simon had no appear- 
ance of a criminal levity in him, yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal, 
strict piety, and sincere affection to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic 
had. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting us to go 
with him, we had something else before us at first, for we had all this while 
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful 
what we should do, for we were now in a place of very little business; and 
once I was about to venture to sail for the River of Kilam, and the city of 
Nanquin; but Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, 
to concern itself in our affairs, and 1 was encouraged, from this very time, 
to think I should, one way or other, get out of this entangled circumstance, 
and be brought home to my own country again, though 1 had not the least 
view of the manner. Providence, I say, began here to clear up our way a little, 
and the first thing that offered, was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought 
a Japan merchant to us, who inquired what goods wc had; and in the first 
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us 
in gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in small 
wedges, of about ten or twelve ounces each. While wc were dealing with him 
for our opium, it came into my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship 
too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him; he shrunk up 
shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him; but in a few days after he 
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter, and told 
me he had a proposal to make to me, which was this: he had bought a great 
quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts of proposals made to him of 
buying the ship; and that, therefore, he had not money to pay for the ship: but 
if I would let the same men who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire 
the ship to go to Japan; and would send them from thence to the Philippine 
Islands with another loading, which he would pay the freight of before they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 321 

went from Japan; and that at their return he would buy the ship. I began to 
listen to his proposal; and so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I 
could not but begin to entertain a notion of going myself with him, and so to 
set sail from the Philippine Islands away to the South Seas: accordingly, I 
asked the Japanese merchant if he would nor hire us to the Philippine Islands 
and discharge us there. He said no, he could nor do that, for then he could 
nor have the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan at the 
ship's return. Well, still 1 was for talcing him at that proposal, and going rny- 
sclf; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing 
rhe dangers, as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who arc a false, cruel, and 
treacherous people; likewise tliose of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more 
talsc, cruel, and treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion: the first thing we 
had to do vvas to consult with the captain of the ship, and ^\ith his men, 
and know if they were willing to go to japan: and sshile I was doing this, the 
young man whom my nephew had left wdth me as my companion for my 
travels came to me, and told me that he thought that voyage promised very 
tair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage, and he would be very 
glad if I undertook it; but that if 1 would not, and w^ould gi\e him leave, he 
would go as a merchant, or as 1 pleased to order him; that if ever he came 
to Kngland, and 1 was there and alive, he would render me a faithful account 
of his success, which should be as much mine as 1 pleased. I was really loath 
to part with him; but considering the prospect of advantage, which really was 
considerable, and that he w^as a young fellow as likt\y to do well in it as any 
I knew, I inclined to let him go; but 1 told him I would consult my partner, 
and give him an answ^er the next day. My partner and I discoursed about 
It, and my partner made a most generous offer. \ou know it has been an 
unlucky ship,*’ said he, “and wc both resolve not to go to sea in it again; if 
your steward (so he called my man) will venture the voyage, 1 wdll leave my 
share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live to 
meet in England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for one 
half of the profits of the ship’s freight to us; the other shall be his own. 

If my partner, who w’^as no w’ay*^ concerned with my young man, made huy* 
such an offer, I could do no less than offer him the same; and all the ships 
company being willing to go with him, w^c made over half the ship to him in 
property, and took a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other, 
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very punctual, 
honest man to him; protected him at Japan, and got him a license to come on 
s>hore, which the Europeans in general have not lately obtained; paid him his 
freight very punctually; sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and 
China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who, trafficking with the Span- 
iards, brought back European goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and 
other spices; and there he was not only paid his freight very well, and at a 
very good price, but not being willing lo sell the ship then, the merchant 
furnished him goods on his own account; and with some money, and some 
spices of his own which he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas 



322 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

to the Spaniards, where he sold his carjgo very well. Here, having got a good 
acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship, and the governor 
of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, in America, on the coast of Mexico, 
and gave him a license to land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass 
in any Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made the voyage to Aca- 
pulco very happily, and there he sold his ship; and having there also obtained 
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found means, somehow or 
other, to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure; and about eight years after, 
came to England, exceeding rich; of which I shall take notice in its place: 
in the mean time, 1 return to our particular affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship’s company, it came before us, of 
course, to consider what recompense wc should give to the two men that gave 
us such timely notice of the design against us in the River Cambodia. The ' 
truth was, they had done us a very considerable service, and deserved well 
at our hands; though, by the w^ay, they were a couple of rogues too; for, as 
they believed the story t)f our being pirates, and that we had really run away 
with the ship, they came dow n to us, not only to betray the design that was 
formed against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates; and one of them con- 
fessed afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a-roguing brought 
liim to do it; however, the service they did us was not the less, and, therefore, 
as I had promised to be grateful to them, T first ordered the money to be paid 
them which they said was due to them on board their respective ships; over 
and above that, 1 gave each of them a small sum of money in gold, which 
contented them very wxll; then 1 made the b'nglishman gunner in the ship, 
the gunner being now made second mate and purser; the Dutchman 1 made 
boatswain; so they were both very well pleased, and proved very serviceable, 
being both able seamen, and very stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China; if I thought myself banished, and remote 
from my own country at Bengal, where I had many w^ays to get home for my 
money, what could I think of myself now% w hen I was got about a thousand 
leagues farther off from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of pros- 
pect of return? All we had for it was this— that in about four months’ time 
there was to be another fair at the place where we were, and then we might 
be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the country, and withal 
might possibly find some Chinese junks or vessels from Tonquin, that would 
be to be sold, and w'ould carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I 
liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons were 
not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might 
have an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to sonte other place in 
India nearer home. Upon these hopes, wc resolved to continue here; but, to 
divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the country. First, we 
went ten days’ journey to the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing, in- 
deed; they say it has a million of people in it: it is regularly built, the streets 
all exactly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which gives the figure 
of it great advantage. But when I come to compare the miserable people of 
these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, their govern- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 323 

ment, their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must con- 
fess that I scarcely think it worth my while to mention them here. It is very 
obscrv'able, that we wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the cere- 
inonies, the government, the manufactures, the commerce, and conduct of 
these people; not that it is to be wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be 
regarded, but because having a true notion of the barbarity of those countries, 
the rudeness and the ignorance that prevail there, we do not expect to find 
any such thing so far off. Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces 
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to the universal commerce 
of England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their cities to ours, for 
wealth, strength, gayety of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety? What 
are their ports, supplied with a few junks and barks, to our navigation, our 
merchant fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our city of London has more 
trade than half their mighty empire: one English, Dutch, or French man-of- 
war of eighty guns, would be able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to 
China: but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power of their govern- 
ment, and the strength of their armies, may be a little surprising to us, because, 
as I have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of Pagans, little better 
than savages, we did not expect such things among them: and this, indeed, is 
the advantage with which all their greatness and power is represented to us; 
otherwise, it is in itself nothing at all; for what 1 have said of their ships may be 
said of their armies and troops; all the forces of their empire, though they were 
to bring two millions of men into the field together, would be able to do noth- 
ing but ruin the country, and starve themselves, if they were to besiege a 
strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplined army; one good line of 
German cuirassiers, or of French cavalry, might withstand all the horse of 
China; a million of their foot could not stand before one embattled body of 
our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be 
one to twenty in number; nay, I do not boast if 1 say that thirty thousand 
German or English foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat 
all die forces of China. And so of our fortified towns: and of the art of our 
engineers in assaulting and defending towns; there is not a fortified town in 
Ghina could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of ^ 
European army; and, at the same time, all the armies of China could never take 
such a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in a ten years’ 
siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in 
their going off; and their powder has but little strength. Their armies are 
badly disciplined, and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat; and therefore, 
I must confess, it seemed strange to me, when 1 came home, and heard our 
peojile say such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and trade of 
the Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to be a contemptible herd 
or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified only 
to rule such a people; and were not its distance inconceivably great from Mus- 
covy, and the Muscovite empire in a manner as rude, impotent, and ill gov- 
erned as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of meir 
country, and conquer them in one campaign; and had the Czar (who is now 



324 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

SL growing prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, 
and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say he has done, and 
if none of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted him, he might by 
this time have been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King 
of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in number. As ihcir 
strength and their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and husbandry, 
are very imperfect, compared to the same things in Europe; also, in their 
knowledge, their learning, and in their skill in the sciences, they are either 
very awkward or defective, though they have globes or spheres, and a smatter- 
ing of the mathematics, and think they know more than all the world be- 
sides; but they know little of the motions of the heavenly bodies; and so 
grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common people, that when the iun 
is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is going to run aw^ay 
with it; and they fall a clattering with all the drums and kettles in the countt) , 
to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a sw^arm of bees. 

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in all the 
accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make no more such; it is none 
of my business, nor any part of my design, but to give an account of my own 
adventures through a life of inimitable w^anderings, and a long variety of 
changes, which, perhaps, few that come after me will have heard the like of: 
I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty places, desert countries, and 
numerous people, I have yet to pass through, more than relates to my own 
story, and which my concern among them makes necessary. 

I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China, about thirty 
degrees north of the line, for we were returned from Nanquin. I had, indeed, 
a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and Father 
Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length, his time of going away l)c*ing 
set, and the other missionary who was to go with him being arrived from 
Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve cither to go or not; so I re- 
ferred it wholly to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at length 
resolved it in the affirmative, and we prepared for our journey. We set out 
with very good advantage, as to finding the way; for we got leave to travel 
in the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy or principal 
magistrate in the province where they reside, and who take great state upon 
them, travelling with great attendance, and great homage from the people, 
who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, being obliged to furnish 
provisions for them and all their attendants in their journeys. That which 1 
particularly observed in our travelling with his baggage, was this— that though 
we received sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our horses from the 
country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were obliged to pay for every- 
thing we had, after the market-price of the country, and the mandarin’s stew- 
ard collected it duly from us; so that our travelling in the retinue of the man- 
darin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was not such a mighty favor 
in him, but was a great advantage to him, considering there were above thirty 
other people travelled in the same manner besides us, under the protection of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 325 

his retinue; for the country furnished all the provisions for nothing to him, 
and yet he took our money for them. 

We were twenty-five days travelling to Pekin, through a country infinitely 
populous, but I think badly cultivated; the husbandry, the economy, and the 
way of living miserable, though they boast so much of the industry of the 
people; I say miserable, if compared with our own, but not so to these poor 

retches, who know no other. The pride of the people is infinitely great, 
and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that 
which I call their misery, and I must needs think the native savages of America 
ii\c much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they have 
nothing, so they desire nothing, whereas these are proud and insolent, and in 
the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges; their ostentation is inex- 
pressible, and, if they can, they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, 
which IS to the last degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all the 
world but themselves. 

I must confess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the deserts and vast 
wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here, and yet the roads here are well paved 
and V ell kept, and very convenient for travellers, but nothing was more awk- 
ward to me than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the 
midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; and my friend Father Simon 
and I used to be very merry upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride 
of these people. For example, coming by the house of a country gentleman, 
as I ather Simon called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nanquin, we had 
fiisi of ail the honor to ride with the master of the house about two miles; the 
state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and 
poverty. His habit was very proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew, being 
a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every 
Side it covered a taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher’s, and which testified 
that his honor must be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was but a poor, 
starved, hobbling creature, and he had two slaves followed him on foot to 
drive the poor creature along, he had a whip in his hand, and he belabored 
the beast as fast about the head, as his slaves did about the tail, and thus he 
rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the city to his coun- 
try scat, about half a league before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure 
of a gentleman rode away before us; and as we stopped at a village about an 
hour to refresh us, when we came by the country scat of this great man, we 
saw him in a little place before his door eating a repast. It was a kind of 
garden, but he was easy to be seen; and we were given to understand that the 
niore we looked at him the better he would be pleased. He sat under a tree, 
i^onicthmg like the palmetto, which effectually shaded him over head, and on 
the south side; but under the tree was placed a large umbrella, which made that 
part look well enough. He sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a 
heavy, corpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two women slaves. 
He had two more, one of whom fed the squire with a spoon, and the other 
held the dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his wor- 
ship’s beard and taffety^ vest. 



326 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Thus leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our looking at him, as 
if we admired his pomp, though we really pitied and contemned him, we 

E sued our journey; only Father Simon had the curiosity to stay to infonn 
self what dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his state, which 
he had the honor to taste of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, 
with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, and 
another plant which they have there, something like out ginger, but smelling 
like musk, and tasting like mustard; all this was put together, and a small 
piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his worship’s repast. Four or five 
servants more attended at a distance, who we supposed were to eat of the sainc 
after their master. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected as a kinjg, 
surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance. But this I observed, 
that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers’ packhorses in 
England seemed to me to look much better; though it was hard to judge 
rightly, for they were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, &c., that 
we could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads as they went 
along. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity that I have given 
an account of being over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which made 
this journey the pleasanter to me, nor had I any ill accident attended me, only 
in passing or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me free of the 
country, as they call it, —that is to say, threw me in. The place was not deep, 
but it wetted me all over. I mention it because it spoiled my pocket-book, 
wherein I had set down the names of several people and places which I had 
occasion to remember, and which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, 
and the words were never after to be read, to my great loss, as to the names 
of some of the places 1 touched at in this journey. 

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me but the youth whom 
my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a servant, and who 
proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody with him but 
one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous 
to see the court, we bore his charges for his company, and to use him as an 
interpreter, for he understood the language of the country, and spoke good 
French and a little English; and indeed this old man was a most useful im- 
plement to us everywhere; for we had not been above a week at Pekin, when 
he came laughing. “Ah, Seignior Inglese,” said he, “1 have something to tell will 
make your heart glad.” “My heart glad,” says I; “what- can that be? I don’t 
know anything in this country can either give me joy or grief to any great 
degree.” “Yes, yes,” said the old man in broken English, “make you glad, 
me sorry.” “Why,” said I, “will it make you sorry?” “Because,” said he, “you 
have brought me here twenty-five days’ journey, and will leave me to go 
back alone; and which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a ship, 
without a horse, without pecune?^^—so he called money, being his broken 
Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry with. In short, he told 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


327 


us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, 
preparing to set out on their journey by land to Muscovy, within four or five 
weeks; and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with them, and 
leave him behind, to go back alone. 

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and had scarce power 
to speak to him for some time; but at last I turned to him. “How do you 
know this?” said 1; “are you sure it is true?” “Yes,” says he; “I met this morn- 
ing in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them. 
He came last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where I for- 
merly knew him but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the 
caravan to Moscow, and so down the River Wolga to Astracan.” “Well, 
seignior,” says I, “do nor be uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this 
be a method for my return to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to 
Macao at all.” We then went to consult together what was to be done; and I 
asked my partner what he thought of the pilot’s news, and whether it would 
suit with his affairs^ He told me he would do just as 1 would; for he had 
settled his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, 
that as we had made a good voyage here, if he could invest it in China silks, 
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, he would be content 
to go to England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal by the company’s 
ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot would 
go with us, we would bear his charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased; 
nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous in that either, if we had 
not rewarded him farther, the service he had done us being really worth more 
than that; for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a 
broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan merchant was some 
hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted together about it, and 
being willing to gratify him, which was but doing him justice, and very will- 
ing also to have liim with us besides, for he w^as a most necessary man on all 
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I com- 
pute it, came to about one hundred and seventy-five pounds sterling, between 
us, and to bear all his charges, both for himself and horse, except only a horse 
to carry his goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we called him to 
let him know what we had resolved. 1 told him he had complained of our 
being willing to let him go back alone, and I was now about to tell him we 
were resolved he should not go back at all; that as we had resolved to go to 
Europe with the caravan, we resolved also he should go with us; and that we 
called him to know his mind. He shook his head, and said it was a long jour- 
ney, and that he had no pecune to carry him thither, or to subsist himself 
when he came there. We told him we believed it was so, and therefore we 
had resolved to do something for him that should let him see how sensible 
we were of the service he had done us, and also how agreeable he was to 
ns; and then I told him what we had resolved to give him here, which he 
might lay out as we would do our own; and that as for his charges, if he would 
go with us we would set him safe on shore (life and casualties excepted), either 



328 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


in Muscovy or England, which he would, at our own charge, except only the 
carriage of his goods. He received the proposal like a man transported, and 
told us he would go with us over the whole world; and so we all prepared 
for our Journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the other mer- 
chants; they had many things to do, and instead of being ready in five weeks, 
it was four months and some days before all things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set out from Pekin. 
My partner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port where we had 
first put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left there; and I, with a 
Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who 
came to Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where 1 bought ninety 
pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other very fine si(ks 
of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these brought to Pel<iin 
against my partner’s return: besides this, we bought a very large quantity of 
raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these goods only, 
to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which, together with 
tea and some fine calicoes, and three camels’ loads of nutmegs and cloves, 
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those we rode upon; which, 
with two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made 
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, made between 
three and four hundred horse, and upwards of one hundred and twenty men, 
very well armed, and provided for all events; for as the Eastern caravans arc 
subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars; but they 
are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they 
prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations; but there were above 
sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them some 
were Livonians; and to our particular satisfaction, five of them were Scots, 
who appeared also to be men of great experience in business, and of very 
good substance. 

When we had travelled one day’s journey, the guides, who were five in 
number, called all the gentlemen and merchants— that is to say, all the passen- 
gers except the servants— to a great council, as they called it. At this council, 
every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the 
necessary expense of buying forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to 
be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses, and the like: and here 
they constituted the journey, as they call it, viz.: they named captains and 
officers to draw us all up, and give the word of command, imease of an attack, 
and give every one their turn of command; nor was this forming us into order 
any more than what we found needful on the way, as shall be observed. 

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and is full of pot- 
ters and earth-makers,- that is to say, people that temper the earth for the 
China-ware; and as I was coming along, our Portugal pilot, who had always 
something or other to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told 
me he would show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 329 

have this to say of China, after all the ill-humored things that I had said of 
it- that I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. 

I \\as very importunate to know what it was; at last he told me it was a 
gentleman’s house built with China-ware. “Well,” says I, “are not the materials 
of their buildings the product of their own country? And so it is all China-ware 
-is it not?” “No, no,” says he; “1 mean it is a house all made of China-ware, 
such as you call it in England, or, as it is called in our country, porcelain.” 
“VVcll,” says 1, “such a thing may be; how big is it? Can w e carry it in a box 
upon a camel? If we can we will buy it.” “Upon a camel!” says the old pilot, 
liolding up both his hands; “why, there is a family of thirty people lives in it.” 

I was then curious, indeed, to see it, and when 1 came to it, it was nothing 
but this it was a timber house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with 
Uth and plaster; but all this plastering was really China-ware,— that is to say, 
It w as plastered with the earth that makes China-ware. The outside, which the 
sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and 
painted with blue figures, as the large China-ware in E'ngland is painted, and 
hard as if it had been burned. As to the inside, all the wails, instead of wain- 
scot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we 
call galley-tiles in England, all made of the finest China, and the figures very 
fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colors, mixed with gold, many tiles 
making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the 
same earth, that it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of 
the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we 
have in use in several parts of England; as hard as stone, and smooth, but not 
burned and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, 
as It were, paved with the same tile; the ceiling and all the plastering work in 
the u hole house were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof was covered 
^\lrh tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black. This was a China-ware- 
house indeed, truly and literally to be called so; and had 1 not been upon the 
journey, I could have staid some days to see and examine the particulars of it. 
The\ told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all paved on 
the bottom and sides with the same; and fine statues set up in rows on the 
ualKs, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burned whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be allowed to excel 
in It, but I am very sure they excel in their accounts of it; for they told me 
'‘Uch incredible things of their performance in crockery-w^are (for such it is) 
tlut I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be true. One told me, in 
particular, of a workman that made a ship, with all its tackle, and masts, and 
"lails, in earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he had told me he 
launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it, 1 might have said something 
to It, indeed; but as it was, 1 knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, 
asking pardon for the word, that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and said nothing 
to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for which the leader 
of it for the day fined me about the value of three shilling; and told me if it 
had been three days’ journey without the wall, as it was three days within, he 



330 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

must have iined me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the next 
council day: I promised to be more orderly; and, indeed, I found afterwards 
the orders made for keeping all together were absolutely necessary for our 
common safety. 

In two days more ue passed the great China wall, made for a fortification 
against the Tartars: and a very great work it is, going over hills and mountains 
in a needless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as 
no enemy could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no 
wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is near a thousand English 
miles, but that the country is five hundred in a straight measured line, wh^ch 
the wall bounds, without measuring the windings and turnings it takes; it is 
about four fathoms high, and as many thick in some places. ' 

I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing our orders (for sb 
long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look at it on every side, near and 
far off,— I mean that was within my view: and the guide of our caravan, who 
liad been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to hear 
my opinion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep out the Tar- 
tars; which he happened not to understand as 1 meant it, and so took it for a 
compliment; but the old pilot laughed. “O, Seignior Inglese,” says he, “you 
speak in colors.” “In colors!” said 1; “what do you mean by that?” “Why, you 
speak what looks white this way, and black that way,— gay one way, and dull 
another. You tell him it is a good wall to keep out I'artars; you tell me by that 
it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars. 1 understand you. Seignior 
Inglese, I understand you; but Seignior Chinese understood you his own way.” 
“Well,” says I, “seignior, do you think it would stand out an army of our 
country people, with a good train of artillery; or our engineers, with two 
companies of miners? Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army 
might enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there 
should be no sign of it left?” “Ay, ay,” says he, “I know that.” The Chinese 
wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few 
days after, for we were then almost out of their country, and he was to leave 
us a little time after this; but when he knew what 1 said, he was dumb all 
the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese 
power and greatness while he staid. 

After wc passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like the Piets’ 
wall, so famous in Northumberland, built by the Romans, we began to find the 
country thinly inhabited, and the people rather confined to live in fortified 
towns and cities, as being subject to the inroads and depredations of the Tar- 
tars, who rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked 
inhabitants of an open country. And here I began to find the necessity of keep- 
ing together in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw several troops of Tartars 
roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that 
the Chinese empire could be conquered by such contemptible fellows; for they 
are a mere horde of wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no 
discipline or manner of fight. Their horses are poor, lean creatures, taught 
nothing, and fit for nothing: and this we found the first day we saw thenit 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 331 

which was after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader for the 
day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, as they call it; and 
what was this but hunting of sheep!— however, it may be called hunting, too, 
for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever 1 saw of their 
kind, only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport when you 
begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or forty in a flock, and, like 
true sheep, always keep together when they fly. 

In pursuit of this old sort of game, it was our hap to meet with about forty 
Tartars: whether they wxrc hunting mutton, as wc were, or whether they 
looked for another kind of prey, wc know not; but as soon as they saw us, one 
of them blew a kind of horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had 
ne\er heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear again. We all supposed 
this \^as to call their friends about them; and so it was, for, in less than 
ten minutes, a troop of forty or fifty more appeared, at about a mile distance; 
but our work was over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst us, and 
as soon as he heard the horn, he told us that wc had nothing to do but to 
charge them iiiiinediatel) , without loss of time, and drawing us up in a line, 
he asked if we were resolved. Wc told him wc wTre ready to follow him; so he 
lodc directly towards them. They stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn 
up in no order, nor showing the face of any order at all; but as soon as they 
saw us advance, they let fly their arrows, which, however, missed us, very hap- 
pily it seems they mistook not their aim, but their distance, for their arrows 
all fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim, that had we been about 
tvxenry yards nearer, wc must have had several men wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance, we fired, and 
sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop, to 
fall in among them sw^ord in hand,— for so our bold Scot that led us directed. 
He was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with vigor and bravery on 
this occasion, and yet with such cool courage too, that 1 never saw any man 
in action fitter for command. As soon as we came up to them, we fired our 
pistols in their faces, and then drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion 
imaginable. The only stand any of them made was on our right, where three 
of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest to come back to them, having a 
kind of cimeter in their hands, and their bows hanging to their backs. Our 
brave commander, without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to 
them, and with his fusee knocks one of them oflF his horse, killed the second 
with his pistol, and the third ran away; and thus ended our fight: but we had 
this misfortune attending it, that all our mutton we had in chase got away. We 
had not a man killed or hurt; but as for the Tartars, there were about five of 
them killed; how many were wounded we knew not; but this we knew, that 
the other party were so frightened with the noise of our guns, that they made 
off, and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore the Tartars 
were not so bold as afterwards; but in about five days we entered a vast, great, 
wild desert, which held us three days’ and nights’ march: and we were obliged 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


332 

to carry our water with us in great leathern bottles, and to encamp all night, 
just as I have heard they do in the desert of Arabia. 

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in: and they told me this was 
a kind of border, that might be called no man’s land, being a part of Great 
Karakathay, or Grand Tartary; that, however, it was all reckoned as belonging 
to China, but that there was no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads 
of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole march, 
though we were to go over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful to me, we saw, 
two or three times, little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon 
their own affairs, and to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who met 
the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them: Wyc 
let them go. Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand and ga/i? 
at us; whether it was to consider if they should attack us or not, we knew not; 
but when we had passed at some distance by them, we made a rcar-guard of 
forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half a mile, or 
thereabouts, before us: but after a while they marched off; only we found they 
saluted us with five arrows at their parting, which wounded a horse so that it 
disabled him, and we left him the next day, poor creature, in great need of a 
good farrier: they might shoot more arrows, which might fall short of us, but 
wc saw no more arrows or Tartars that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good as at first, 
though still in the dominions of the Emperor of China, but lay for the most 
part in the villages, some of which were fortified, because of the incursions of 
the Tartars. When we were come to one of these towns (it was about two 
days and half’s journey before wc came to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy 
a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that road, and 
horses also, such as they are, because, so many caravans coming that way, they 
are often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me a camel, would have 
gone and fetched one for me; but I, like a fool, must be officious, and go myself 
along with him; the place was about two miles out of the village, where, it 
seems, they kept the camels and horses feeding, under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very desirous 
of a little variety. When we came to the place, it was a low, marshy ground, 
walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, without mortar or earth among 
it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought 
a camel, and agreed for the price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went 
with me led the camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars on horseback. 
Two of them seized the fellow and took the camel from Jiinr, while the other 
three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for 
I had no weapon about me but my sword, which could but ill defend me 
against three horsemen. The first that came up stopped short upon my drawing 
my sword, for they are arrant cowards; but a second, coming upon my left, 
gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, 
when I came to myself, what was the matter, and where I was, for he laid me 
flat on the ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Provi- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 333 

dencc, unlooked-for, ♦ directs deliverances from dangers which to us are 
unforeseen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the 
Tartars either; if they had, 1 suppose they would not have attacked us; but 
cowards are always boldest when there is no danger. The old man, seeing me 
down, with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and 
laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down by main force 
a little towards him, with the other shot him in the head, and laid him dead 
upon the spot. He then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, 
as I said, and before he could come forward again, made a blow at him with 
a cimcter, which he always wore, but missing the man, struck his horse in the 
side of his head, cut one of the ears off by the root, and a great slice down by 
the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no more to 
be governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough, too; but away he 
flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot’s reach, and at some distance, rising 
upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him. 

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, but he 
had no weapon; however, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon 
him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly, ill-favored weapon he 
bad by his side—somerhing like a poleaxe, but not a poleaxe neither,— he 
vrcnched it from him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with 
It But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and seeing he did 
nor fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stood 
stock still, the old man stood still too, and fell to work with his tackle to 
charge his pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, away he 
scoured, and left my pilot— my champion I called him afterwards— a complete 
victory. 

By this time I was a little recovered; for I thought, when I first began to 
vake, that 1 had been in a sweet sleep; but, as I said above, I wondered where 
1 uas, how 1 came upon the ground, and what was the matter: but a few 
moments after, as sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where; 
so I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then 1 felt my 
head ache: and then in a moment memory returned, and everything was 
present to me again. I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of* my 
sword, but no enemies were in view; I found a Tartar lying dead, and his 
horse standing very quietly by him, and, looking farther, 1 saw my champion 
and deliverer, who has been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back 
with his hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running 
to me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I 
had been killed; and seeing me bloody, would sec how 1 was hurt; but it was 
not much, only what we call a broken head; neither did I afterwards find any 
great inconvenience from the blow, for it was well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we lost a camel and 
gained a horse. But that which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel; 1 disputed it, and it was 
brought to a hearing before the Chinese judge of the place. To give him his 
due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality; and, having 



334 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man, that went with me to buy 
the camel, whose servant he was? “I am no servant,” says he, “but went with 
the stranger.” “At whose request?” says the justice. “At the stranger’s request,” 
says he. “Why, then,” says the justice, “you were the stranger’s servant for the 
time; and the camel being delivered to ms servant, it was delivered to him, and 
he must pay for it.” 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say; but, admiring 
to see such just reasoning upon the consequence, and an accurate stating of the 
case, I paid willingly for the camel, and sent for another; but, you may 
observe, I did not go to fetch it myself any more, for I had had enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire; they call it fortified, 
and so it is, as fortifications go there; for this I will venture to affirm, that 
the Tartars in Karakathay, which, 1 beheve, are some millions, could not batter 
down the walls with their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it wer^ 
attacked with cannon, would be to make those who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days’ journey of this city, when mes- 
sengers were sent express to every part of the road to tell all travellers and 
caravans to halt till they had a guard sent for them; for that an unusual body 
of Tartars, making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty 
miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers; however, it was carefully done of the 
governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly, 
two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the 
Chinese, on our left, and three hundred more from the city of Naum, and 
with these we advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from Naum 
marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men on each side 
of our camels, with our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre; in this 
order, and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the 
whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next day, 
when they did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching from a well-situated little 
town, called Changu, we had a river to pass, which we were obliged to ferry; 
and, had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the time to have 
attacked us, when, the caravan being over, the rear-guard was behind; but they 
did not appear there. About three hours after, when we were entered upon a 
desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust they 
raised, we saw an enemy was at hand; and they were at hand, indeed, for they 
came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard in the front, who had talked so big the day before, 
began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which is a 
certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of 
my mind; and being near me, called out, “Seignior Inglese,” says he, “those 
fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars come 
on they will never stand it.” “I am of your mind,” said I; “but what must be 
done?” “Done’” says he; “let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on 
each wing, and encourage them; and they will fight like brave fellows in brave 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 33S 

company; but without this, they will every man turn his back.” Immediately, I 
rode up to our leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind; and 
accordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left, and the 
rest made a line of rescue; and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred 
men to make a body by themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need 
were, they should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they were; 
how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought, was the least; a 
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, traversing the ground in 
the front of our line; and, as wc found them within gun-shot, our leader 
ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each 
wing with their shot, which was done; and they went off, T suppose back, to 
give an account of the reception they were like to meet with; and, indeed, that 
salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood awhile to 
consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their design, and said 
no more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to our circumstances, 
uhich were but very indifferent for a battle with such a number. 

Two days after, wc came to the city of Naun, or Naum; we thanked the 
governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred crowns, or 
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested 
one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept 
here: but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer 
to them than they now do, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the 
country, which lies from this city west for about two hundred miles, as desolate 
and unfit for use; and more especially being so very remote, and so difficult to 
send troops thither for its defence: for we were yet above two thousand miles 
from Muscovy, properly so called. 

After this, we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts; one of 
which we were sixteen days passing over, and which, as I said, was to be 
called no man’s land; and, on the 13th of April, we came to the frontiers of 
the Muscovite dominions. 1 think the first town, or fortress, whichever it may 
be called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Arguna, being on 
the west side of the River Arguna. 

1 could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was so soon arrived in, 
as I called it, a Christian country, or, at least, in a country governed by 
Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, but just deserve the 
name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very devout in thek 
way. It would certainly occur to any man who travels the world as I have 
done, and who had any power of reflection, what a blessing it is to be brought 
into the world where the name of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and 
worshipped; and not where the people, given up by Heaven to strong delu- 
sions, worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones; worship 
monsters, elements, horrid-shaped animals, and statues or images of monsters. 
Not a town or city we passed through but had their pagodas, their idols, and 
their temples, and ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own 
hands. Now we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared; 



336 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not, yet the 
Christian religion was owned, and the name of the true God was called upon 
and adored; and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots 
merchant I mentioned above with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking 
him by the hand, I said to him, “Blessed be God, we are once again amongst 
Christians.” He smiled and answered, “Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; 
these Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it, 
you may see very little of the substance for some months farther of our 
journey.” “Well,” says I, “but still it is better than Paganism and worshijpping 
of devils.” “Why, 1 will tell you,” says he; “except the Russian soldiers in the 
garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the reJpt 
of this country, for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worit 
and most ignorant of Pagans.” And so, indeed, we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth, if I understand 
anything of the surface of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
world; we had, at least, mclve thousand miles to the sea, eastward; two 
thousand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward; and above three thousand, 
if we left that sea, and went on west, to the British and Frcncli channels: we 
had full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian Sea, south; and about 
eight hundred to the Frozen Sea, north. Nay, if some people may be believed, 
there might be no sea north-cast till we came round the Pole, and conse- 
quently into the north-west, and so had a continent of land into America, the 
Lord knows where; though I could give some reasons why I believe that to be 
a mistake. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good while before we came 
to any considerable towns, we had nothing to observe there but this: first, that 
all the rivers run to the cast; as 1 understood by the charts, which some in our 
caravan had with them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the great River 
Yamour, or Gamour; which river, by the natural course of it, must run into 
the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The story they tell us, that the mouth of this 
river is choked up with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz.: three feet 
about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say, I believe 
nothing of it; but, as its navigation is of no use, because there is no trade that 
way, the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle, so 
nobody that ever I heard of has been curious enough either to go down to the 
mouth of it in boats, or come up from the mouth of it in ships, as far as I can 
find: but this is certain, that this river running east, in the latitude of about 
50 degrees, carries a vast concourse of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean 
to empty itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river, there arc several considerable rivers, 
whose streams run as due north as the Yamour runs east; and these are all 
found to join their waters with the great River Tartarus, named so from the 
northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartars; who, as the Chinese say, were 
the first Tartars in the world; and who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog 
and Magog mentioned in sacred history. These rivers running all northward, as 
well as all the other rivers 1 am yet to speak of, make it evident that the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 337 

northern ocean bounds the lands also on that side; so that it does not seem 
rational in the least to think that the land can extend itself to join with 
America on that side, or that there is not a communication between the 
northern and eastern ocean; but of this I shall say no more; it was my observa- 
rion at that time, and therefore 1 take notice of it in this place. 

We now advanced from the River Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, 
and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Muscovy has taken to 
have cities and towns built in as many places as it is possible to place them, 
where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed 
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire; some of which I had 
read of were placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the 
lodging of travellers: and thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at 
these towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians, and pro- 
fessed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, 
and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven; and not 
only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most 
l>arbarous, except only that they did not eat men’s flesh, as our savages of 
America did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country between Arguna, where 
wc enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together, 
called Nortziousky, in which is a continued desert or forest, which cost us 
twenty days to travel over. In a village near the last of these places, I had the 
curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most brutish and unsuffer- 
ablc. They had, 1 suppose, a great sacrifice that day; for there stood out, upon 
an old stump of a tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil; at least, 
as anything we can think of to represenrthe devil can be made: it had a head 
not resembling any creature that the world ever saw; cars as big as goats’ 
horns, and as high; eyes as big as a crown-piece; a nose like a crookeJ ram’s 
horn, and a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible 
teeth, hooked like a parrot’s under bill; it was dressed up in the filthiest manner 
that you could suppose; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool 
outward; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through 
It, it was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other propor- 
tion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village; and, when I came 
near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures— whether men or women 
1 could not tell, for they made no distinction by their habits— all lying flat upon 
the ground lound this formidable block of shapeless wood; I saw no motion 
among them, any more than if they had been all logs of wood, like the idol, 
and at first I really thought they had been so; but, when I came a little nearer, 
they started up upon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if they had been 
so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if they were displeased at 
our disturbing them. A little way off from the idol, and at the door of a tent 
nr hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood three butchers,— I 
thought they were such when I came nearer to them, for I found they had long 
knives in their hands; and in the middle of the ten appeared three sheep killed, 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

and one young bullock or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseles: 
log of an idol; the three men were priests belonging to it, and the seventeet 
prostrated wretches were the people who brought the offering, and wer< 
making their prayers to that stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish worship of j 
hobgoblin than ever I was at anything in my life,— to see God’s most glorioui 
and best creature, to whom He had granted so many advantages, even by crea 
tion, above the rest of the works of His hands, vested with a reasonable soul 
and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to honor hi; 
Maker, and be honored by Him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so vierj 
stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object 
dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their pwi 
contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags,— and that this should be t\h< 
effect of mere ignorance, wTought up into hellish devotion by the deVi 
himself, who, envying his Maker the homage and adoration of his creatures 
had deluded them into such sordid and brutish things as one would thini 
would shock nature itself! 

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts? And thu: 
it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there was no room to wonder at it 
or think it impossible; all my admiration turned to rage, and I rode up to th< 
image or monster— call it what you will— and with my sword made a stroke a 
the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it in two; and one of our men tha 
was with me took hold of the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it, when 
behold, a most hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, and twe 
or three hundred people came about my cars, so that 1 was glad to scour foi 
it, for we saw sc^me had bows and arrows; but I resolved from that momem 
to visit them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about four milei 
off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, several of the horse 
having been lamed and jaded with the badness of the way and long march ovci 
the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put my design in execution. ] 
communicated it to the Scots merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I hac 
sufficient testimony; 1 told him what I had seen, and with what indignation i 
had since thought that human nature could be so degenerate; I told him if 
could get but four or five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved to gt 
and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them sec that it had no powcj 
to help itself, and consequently could not be an object of worship, or to b< 
prayed to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me: says he, “Your zeal may be good,' but what do yoi 
propose to yourself by it?” “Propose!” said 1; “to vindicate the honor of God 
which is insulted by this devil worship.” “But how will it vindicate the hono 
of God,” said he, “while the people will not be able to know what you mcai 
by it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them so? and then they wil 
fight you, and beat you, too, I assure you; for they are desperate fellows, an( 
that especially in defence of their idolatry.” “Can we not,” said I, “do it in th< 
night, and then leave them the reasons and the causes in writing in their owi 



ROBINSON C31US6E 339 

language?” “Writing!” said he; “why, there is not a man in five nations of 
them that knows anything of a letter, or how to read a word any way.” 
“Wretched ignorance!” said I to him; “however, I have a great mind to do it; 
perhaps nature may draw inferences from it to them, to let them sec how 
brutish they are to worship such horrid things.” “Look you, sir,” said he; “if 
your zeal prompts you to do it so warmly, you must do it; but, in the next 
place, 1 would have you consider these wild nations of people are subjected 
by force to the Czar of Muscovy’s dominion; and if you do this, it is ten to 
one but they will come by thousands to the governor of Nertsinskay and 
demand satisfaction; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, it is ten to one 
but they revolt, and it will occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the 
country,” 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a while; but I harped 
upon the same string still; and all that day I was uneasy to put my project in 
execution. Towards the evening the Scots merchant met me by accident in our 
valk about the town, and desired to speak with me. “I believe,” said he, “I 
have put you off your good design. I have been a little concerned about it 
since, for I abhor idolatry as much as you can do.” “Truly,” said I, “you have 
put off a little the execution of it; but you have not put it out of my thoughts, 
and I believe I shall do it before I quit this place, though I were to be delivered 
up to them for satisfaction.” “No, no,” said he; “God forbid they should 
deliver you up to such a crew of monsters! They shall not do that either; that 
would be murdering you, indeed.” “Why,” said I, “how would they use me?” 
“Use you!” said he; “I’ll tell you how they served a poor Russian who 
affronted them in their vx)rship just as you did, and whom they took prisoner, 
after they had lamed him with an arrow that he could not run away. They 
took him and stripped him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the idol- 
monster, and stood all round him, and shot as many arrows into him as would 
stick over his whole body; and then they burned him, and all the arrows 
sticking in him, as a sacrifice to the idol.” “And was this the same idol? ” said 1. 
“Yes,” said he, “the very same.” “Well,” said I, “I will tell you a story.” So I 
related the story of our men at Madagascar, and how they burned and sacked 
the village there, and killed man, woman, and child, for their murdering one 
of our men, just as it is related before; and I added that I thought we ought to 
do so to this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked of doing so to 
that village, said he, “You mistake very much; it was not this village— it was 
almost a hundred miles from this place; but it was the same idol, for they 
carry him about in procession all over the country.” “Well,” said 1, “then that 
idol ought to be punished for it; and it shall,” said I, “if I live this night out.” 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me I should 
not go alone, but he would go with me, but he would go first and bring a stout 
fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; “and one,” said he, “as 
famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish things 
as these.” In a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called 
Captain Richardson; and I gave him a full account of what I had seen, and also 



340 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


what I intended; and he told me readily he would go with me if it cost him 
his life. So we agreed to go— only we three. 1 had, indeed, proposed it to my 
partner, but he declined it. He said he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and 
upon all occasions, for my defence; but this was an adventure quite out of his 
way; so, I say, we resolved upon our work, only we three and my man-servant, 
and to put it into execution that night about midnight, with all the secrecy 
imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it till the next 
night, because the caravan being to set forv^^ard in the morning, we supposed 
the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us whep we 
were out of his power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for 
the enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar’s robe or gowt^ of 
sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same 
for himself and his countryman, that the people, if they saw us, should not 
determine who we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter, with 
aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get; and having a 
good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour after night we set out upon 
our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o’clock at night, and found that the 
people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night was 
cloudy; yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in 
the same posture and place that it did before. The people seemed to be all at 
their rest; only that in the great hut, or tent, as we called it, where we saw the 
three priests, whom we mistook for butchers, we saw a light, and going up 
close to the door, we heard people talking as if there w ere five or six of them; 
we concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, these men would 
come out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it from the destruc- 
tion that we intended for it: and what to do with them we knew not. Once we 
thought of carrying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance; but when w^e 
came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our carriage; so we were at a loss 
again. The second Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and knock- 
ing the creatures that were there on the head when they came out; but I could 
not join with that; I was against killing them, if it were possible to avoid it. 
“Well, then,” said the Scots merchant, “I will tell you what we will do: wc 
will try to make them prisoners, tie their hands, and make them stand and 
see their idol destroyed.” 

As it happened, wc had twine or packthread enough about us, which we 
used to tie our firelocks together with; so we resolved to attack these people 
first, and with as little noise as we could. The first thing we did we knocked 
at the door, when one of the priests coming to it, we immediately seized upon 
him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol, 
where we gaggdd him that he might not make a noise, tied his feet also 
together, and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another would come out 
to sec what the matter was; but we waited so long till the third man came 



ROBINSON CRUSOR 


341 

back to us; and then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently, and 
immediately out came two more, and we served them just in the same manner, 
but were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol some 
distance from one another; when, going back, we found wo more were come 
out to the door, and a third stood behind them within the door. We seized 
the two, and immediately tied them, when the third, stepping back and crying 
out, my Scots merchant went in after him, and taking out a composition we 
had made that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it in 
among them. By that time the other Scotsman and my man, taking charge of 
the two men already bound, and tied together also by the arm, led them 
away to the idol, and left them there, to see if their idol would relieve them, 
nuking haste back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much smoke 
that they were almost suffocated, we then threw in a small leather bag of 
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and following it in, we found there 
were but four people, and, as we supposed, had been about some of their 
diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short, frightened to death, at least so 
as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak cither for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had done the other, and all 
without any noise, 1 should have said wc brought them out of the house or hut 
first, for indeed wc were not able to bear the smoke any more than they were. 
When wx had done this, wc carried them all together to the idol; when we 
came there, we fell to work with him; and first we daubed him all over, and 
his robes also, with tar, and such other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed 
with brimstone; and then wc stopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth full of 
gunpowder; then wc wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and 
then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we 
looked about to sec if we could find anything else to help to burn him; when 
ni) Scotsman remembered that by the tent or hut, where the men were, there 
lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes I do not remember; away 
he and the other Scotsman ran, and fetched their arms full of that. When we 
had done this, we took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied 
their feet and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them 
before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the powder in the 
eyes, and mouth, and ears of^'thc idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had 
split and deformed the shape of it; and, in a word, till we saw it burned into 
a mere block or log of wood; and setting dry forage to it, wc found it would 
j be quite consumed; so we began to think of going av^ay; but the Scotsman 
‘ said, “No, we must not go, for these poor deluded wretches will all throw 
j themselves into the fire, and burn themselves with the idol.” So we resolved to 
I stay till the forage was burned down too, and then came away and left them. 

After the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning among our 
fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey; nor 
could any man suggest that we had been anywhere but in our beds, as travellers 
flight be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigues of the day’s journey. 



342 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great number of the 
country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous manner demanded 
satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their priests, and burn, 
ing their great Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertsinskay were at first 
in a great consternation, for they said the Tartars were already no less than 
thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease 
them, and gave them all the good words imaginable, assuring them that he 
knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison been abroad, 
so that it could not be from anybody there: but if they could let him know 
who did it, they should be excmplarily punished. They returned haughtily, 
that all the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt m 
the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his imagd but 
some Christian miscreant; and they therefore resolved to denounce war aglmst 
him and all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, or to have any 
cause of war alleged to be given by him, the Czar having strictly charged 
him to treat the conquered country with gentleness and civility, gave them 
still all the good words he could. At last he told them there was a caravan 
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who had 
done them this injury, and that if they would be satisfied with that, he would 
send after them to inquire into it. This seemed to appease them a little; and 
accordingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account how 
the thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had done it, they 
should make their escape, but that whether we had done it or no, we should 
make all the haste forward that was possible, and that, in the mean time, he 
would keep them in play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it came to the 
caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the matter, and as for us that 
were guilty, we were least of all suspected. However, the captain of the 
caravan for the time, took the hint that the governor gave us, and 
travelled two days and two nights, without any considerable stop, and then 
we lay at a village called Plothus: nor did we make any long stop here, but 
hastened on towards Jarawena, another of the Czar of Muscovy’s colonics, 
and where we expected we should be safe. But upon the second day’s march 
from Plothus, by the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some of our 
people began to be sensible wc were pursued. We had entered a great desert, 
and had passed by a great lake called Schaks Oser, when we perceived a very 
great body of horse appear on the Other side of the lake, to the north, we 
travelling west. We observed they went away west, as \<e did, but had sup- 
posed we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happJy 
took the south side; and in two days more they disappeared again: for they, 
believing we were still before them, pushed on till they reached the River 
Udda, a very great river when it passes farther north, but when we came to it; 
we found it narrow and fordable. 

The third day they had either found their mistake, or and intelligence of 
us, and came pouring in upon us towards the dusk of the evening. We had, 



ROBINSON C31USOE 343 

to our. great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our camp, which was 
yery convenient for the night; for as we were upon a desert, though but at 
the beginning of it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no towns 
to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena, which we had 
yet two days’ march to; the desert, however, had some few woods in it on 
this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great River Udda; it was in 
a narrow strait, between little but very thick woods, tliat we pitched our little 
camp for that night, expecting to be attacked before morning. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for: but as it was usual 
with the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans 
always fortify themselves every night against them, as against armies of 
robbers; and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued. 

! But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most advantageous 
Icanip; for we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet running just before 
our front, so that we could not be surrounded, or attacked any way but in 
our front or rear. We took care also to make our front as strong as we could 
by placing our packs, with our camels and horses, all in a line, on the inside 
of the river, and felling some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was upon us 
before we had finished. They did not come on us like thieves, as we expected, 
but sent three messengers to us to demand the men to be delivered to them 
that had abused their priests, and burned their god Cham Chi-Thaungu with 
fire, that they might burn them with fire; and upon this, they said, they would 
go away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they would destroy us all 
Our men looked very blank at this message, and began to stare at one another 
to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces; but nobody was the 
word-nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured 
that it was not done by . any of our camp; that we were peaceful merchants, 
travelling on our business; that we had done no harm to them or to any one 
else; and that, therefore, they must look farther for their enemies who had 
injured them, for we were not the people; so desired them not to disturb us, 
for if they did we should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer; and a great 
crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of day, to our 
camp; but seeing us in such an unaccountable situation, they durst come no 
farther than the brook in our front, where they stood, and showed us such 
a number that indeed terrified us very much; for those that spoke least of them 
spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and looked at us a while, and then 
setting up a great howl, they let fly a great crowd of arrows among us; but 
we were well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under our baggage, 
^nd I do not remember that one of us was hurt. 

Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our right, and expected 
them on the rear; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jarawena, in the pay 

the Moscovites, calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, “I’ll go 
‘end all these people away to Siheilka.” This was a city four or five days’ 
oumey at least to the right, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow and 



344 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly as it 
were back to Nertsinskay: after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes 
directly on the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell them 
a long story that the people who had burned the Cham Chi-Thaungu were 
gone to Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them— that is to 
say, Christians; and that they had resolved to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging 
to the Tongueses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke their language, 
he counterfeited so well that they all believed him, and away they drove in a 
most violent hurry to Siheilka, which, it seems, was five days’ journey t6 the 
north; and in less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and 
we never heard any more of them, nor whether they went to Siheilka oi no. 
So we passed away safely on to Jarawena, where there was a garrisoi^ of 
Muscovites, and there we rested five days; the caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the last day’s hard march, and with want of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us twenty-three days’ 
march. We furnished ourselves with some tents here, for the better accom- 
modating ourselves in the night; and the leader of the carav an procured sixteen 
carriages or wagons of the country, for carrying our water or provisions, 
and these carriages were our defence, every night round our little camp; so 
that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, 
they would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to have wanted rest again after this long journey; 
for in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we 
saw abundance of the sable hunters, who are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, 
of which this country is a part; and they frequently attack small caravans, 
but we saw no numbers of them together. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty well 
inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by the Czar of 
Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans and 
defend the country against the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very 
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders for 
the well guarding the caravans and merchants, that, if there are any Tartars 
heard of in the country, detachments of the garrison are always sent to see 
the travellers safe from station to station. And thus the governor of Adinskoy 
—whom I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots 
merchant, who was acquainted with him— offered us a guard of fifty men, if 
we thought there was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to^ Europe, we should 
find the country better inhabited, and the people more civilized; but I found 
myself mistaken in both; for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass 
through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity as before; 
only, as they were conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so dangerous, 
but for rudeness of manners, and idolatry, no people in the world ever went 
beyond them; they are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are 
built of the same; you know not a man from a woman, neither by the rugged" 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 345 

icss of their countenances nor their clothes; and in the winter, when the 
rround is covered with snow, they live underground in vaults, which have 
-avitics going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole village or country, 
hese had idols in every hut and every cave: besides, they worship the stars, 
he sun, the water, the snow, and, in a word, everything they do not under- 
,tand, and they understand but very little; so that every element, every uncom- 
non thing, sets them sacrificing. I met with nothing peculiar myself in all 
his country, which 1 reckon was, from the desert I spoke of last, at least four 
lundrcd miles, half of it being another desert, which took us up twelve days’ 
levere travelling, without house or ticc; and w'c were obliged again to carry 
)ur own provisions, as w^cll water as bread. After wc were out of this desert, 
md had travelled two days, we came to Janc/ay, a Muscovite city, or station, 
the great River Janezay, which, they told us there, parted Europe from 
A.sia. 

Here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed, except in the Mus- 
unite garrisons. All the country between the River Oby and the River Janezay 
IS as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars; 
nay, as any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. I also found, which I 
observed to the Muscovite governors whom 1 had an opportunity to converse 
v\irh, that the poor pagans are not much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for 
being under the Muscovite government, wdiich they acknowledged w^as true 
enough; but that, as they said, w’^as none of their business; that if the Czar 
expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should be 
done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers; and they added, with 
more sincerity than I expected, that they found it was not so much the concern 
of thur monarch to make the people Christians as it was to make them subjects. 
From this river to the great River Oby we crossed a wild, uncultivated 
country, barren of people and good management; otherwise it is in itself a 
most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabitants we found in 
It are all pagans, except such as arc sent among them from Russia; for this is 
the country— I mean on both sides the River Oby— whither the Muscovite 
criimnals that arc not put to death are banished, and from whence it is next 
to impossible they should ever get away. 

1 have nothing material to say of my particular affairs till I came to Tobolski, 
the capital city of Siberia, where I continued some time on the following 
account. 

We had now^ been almost seven months on our journey, and winter began 
to conic on apace; whereupon my partner and I called a council about our 
particular affairs, in which w'e found it proper, as we were bound for England, 
and not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us 
pi sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter time; and, 
indeed, they have such things that it would be incredible to relate the par- 
ticulars of, by which means the Russians travel more in winter than they can 
jn summer, as in these sledges they are able to run night and day; the snow, 
peing frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the hills, vales, 



346 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

rivets, and lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon th( 
surface, without any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to urge a wintcjr journey of this kind: I was bound tc 
England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways: either I must go 05 
as the caravan went, till I came to Jaroslaw, and then go off west for Narva, 
and the Gulf of Finland, and so on to Dantzic, where 1 might possibly sell rny 
China cargo to good advantage; or 1 must leave the caravan at a little town on 
the Dwina, from hence 1 had but six days by water to Archangel, and from 
thence might be sure of shipping cither to England, Holland, or Hamburg. 

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would have been preposter- 
ous; foi^'as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen up, and I could not 
get pl^jl^e; and to go by land in those countries was far less safe than aWng 
the Afcgul Tartars; likewise, to go to Archangel in October, all the iships 
would be gone from thence, and even the merchants who dwell there m 
summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone; so 
that I could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarem 
of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter; so that, upon the 
whole, I thought it much my better way to let the caravan go, and make 
provision to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude ol 
about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold 
winter with, viz.: plenty of provisions, such as the country afforded, a warml 
house, with fuel enough, and excellent company. 

1 was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island, where I 
never felt cold, except when I had my ague, on the contrary, I had much to 
do to bear any clothes on my back, and never made any fire but without 
doors, which was necessary for dressing my food, &c. Now 1 had three good 
vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and 
button close to the wrists; and all these lined with furs, to make them 
sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our way in England 
of making fires in every room in the house in open chimneys, which, when 
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold as the climate; but 
taking an apartment in a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be 
built like a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove; the funnel 
to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to come at the fire went m 
another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no fire seen, just ai 
they heat the bagnios in England. By this means wc had always the sanK 
climate in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and how coli 
soever it was without, it was always warm within; and y6t we saw no fire, noJ 
were ever incommoded with smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to meet v/it 
good company here, in a country so barbarous as that of the most norther! 
parts of Europe, near the Frozen Ocean, within but a very few degrees 
Nova Zembla. But this being the country where the state criminals of 
covy, as 1 observed before, are all banished, this city was full of nobleiue>J 
gentlemen, soldiers, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here was the famous Princ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 347 

Galitzin, the old General Robostiski, and several other persons of note, and 
some ladies. By means of my Scotch merchant, whom, nevertheless, I parted 
with here, I made an acquaintance with several of these gentlemen; and from 
these, in the long winter nights in which I staid here, I received several very 
agreeable visits. 

It was talking one night with Prince — , one of the banished ministers of 
state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that the discourse of my particular 
case began. He had been telling me abundance of fine things of the greatness, 
the magnificence, the dominions, and the absolute power of the Emperor of 
the Russians: I interrupted him, and told him I was a greater and more 
powerful prince than e\ er the Czar of Muscovy was, though niy dominions 
were not so large, or my people so many. The Russian grandee looked a little 
surprised, and, fixing his c)cs steadily upon me, began t() wonder what I 
meant. 1 told him his wonder w^oiild cease when 1 had explained myself. First, 

I fold him I had absolute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects; 
that notwithstanding my absolute power, I had not one person disaffected to 
my government, or to my person, in all my dominions. He shook his head at 
that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the C/ar of Muscovy. I told him that all 
the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all iny subjects were not only my 
tenants, but tenants at will; that they would all fight for me to the last drop; 
and that never tyrant (for such I acknowledged myself to be) was ever so 
universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared by his subjects. 

After ainusing him w ith these riddles in government for a while, I opened 
the case, and told him the story at large of my living in the island; and how I 
managed both myself and the people that were under me, just as I have since 
minuted it down. They w cre exceedingly taken with the story, and especially 
the prince, who told me, with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be 
masters of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged such a state of life as 
mine, to be Oar of Muscovy; and that he found more felicity in the retire- 
ment he seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found in the highest 
authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar; that the height of 
human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to our circumstances, and to 
make a calm within, under the weight of the greatest storms without. When he 
came first hither, he said he used to tear the hair from his head, and the 
clothes from his back, as others had done before him, but a little time and 
consideration had made him look into himself, as well as round him, to things 
^\ithout: that he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect 
upon the state of universal life, and how little this world was concerned in its 
true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself, fully 
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and desires, with but 
very little assistance from the world; the air to breathe in, food to sustain life, 
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order to health, completed, in 
his opinion, all that the w^orld could do for us; and though the greatness, the 
authority, the riches, and the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world, had 
much in them that was agreeable to us, yet all those things chiefly gratified the 
I coarsest of our affections, such as our ambition, our particular pride, avarice. 



m 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


vanity, and sensuality; all which^ being the mere product of the worst part 
of man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them the seeds of all manner 
of crimes; but neither were related to, nor concerned with, any of those 
virtues that constituted us wise men, nor of those graces that distinguished us 
as Christians; that being now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he 
enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he said he was at leisure to look 
upon the dark side of them, where he found all manner of deformity; and was 
now convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and 
preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future state; and in this, 
he said, they were more happy in their banishment than all their enemies were, 
who had the full possession of all the wealth and power they had left behind 
them. “Nor, sir,” says he, “do 1 bring my mind to this politically, from\the 
necessity of my circumstances, which some call miserable; but, if I know any- 
thing of myself, 1 would not now go back, though the Czar my master should 
call me, and reinstate me in all my former grandeur; I say, 1 would no more 
go back to it than 1 believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison 
of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, would come 
back to the jail of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in, and leave heaven, to 
deal in the dirt and crime of human affairs.” 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much earnestness 
and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it was the true sense of his soul; 
there was no room to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once thought myself a 
kind of monarch in my old station, of which I had given him an account; but 
that 1 thought he was not only a monarch, but a great conqueror; for he that 
had got a victory over his own exorbitant desites, and the absolute dominion 
over himself, he whose reason entirely governs his will, is certainly greater 
than he that conquers a city. “But, my lord,” said I, “shall I take the liberty to 
ask you a question?” “With all my heart,” says he. “If the door of your liberty 
was opened,” said I, “would y’^ou not take hold of it, to deliver yourself from 
this exile?” “Hold,” said he; “your question is subtle, and requires some serious, 

i *ust distinctions to give it a sincere answer; and 1 will give it you from the 
)ottom of my heart. Nothing that I know of in the world would move me to 
deliver myself from this state of banishment, except these two: first, the enjoy- 
ment of my relations; and, secondly, a little warmer climate; but I protest to 
you, that to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power, the hurry 
of a minister of state; the wealth, the gayety, and the pleasures of a courtier; 
if my master should send me word this moment that he restores me to all he 
banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at all, I would not leave this 
wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow.” 
“But, my lord,” said I, “perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures 
of the court, and from the power, authority, and wealth you enjoyed before, 
but you may be absent, too, from some of the conveniences of life: your estate, 
perhaps, confiscated, and your effects plundered; and the supplies left you 
here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life.” “Ay,” says he, “that 
is as you suppose me to be a lord, or a prince, &c.; so, indeed, I am; but you 
are now to consider me only as a man, a human creature, not at all dis- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 349 

tinguished from another; and so I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited 
with sickness and distempers. However, to put the question out of dispute, you 
see our way of life: we are, in this place, five persons of rank; we live j^r- 
fectly retired, as suited to a state of banishment; we have something rescued 
from the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity 
of hunting for our food; but the poor soldiers, who are here without that 
help, live in as much plenty as we, who go into the woods and catch sables 
and foxes; the labor of a month will maintain them a year; and as the way of 
living is not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient for ourselves. So that 
objection is out of doors.” 

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable conversation I 
had with this truly great man; in all which he showed that his mind was so 
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so supported by religion, as well 
as by a vast share of wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really as much 
as he had expressed, and that he was always the same to the last, as will appear 
in the story 1 am going to tell. 

1 had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I thought it; the 
cold so intense that 1 could not so much as look abroad without being wrapped 
in furs, and a mask of fur before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole 
for breath, and two for sight: the little daylight we had was, as we reckoned, 
for three month.s not above five hours a day, and six at most; only that the 
snow lying on the ground continually, and the weather being clear, it was 
never quite dark. Our horses were kept, or rather starved, under ground; and 
as for our servants, whom wc hired here to look after ourselves and horses, 
we had, every now and then, their fingers and toes to thaw and take care of, 
lest they should mortify and fall off. 

It IS true, w'ithin doors we were warm, the houses being close, the walls 
thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh 
of deer, dried and cured in the season; bread good enough, but baked as bis- 
cuits, dried fish of several sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of buffaloes, 
which is pretty good meat. All the stores of provisions for the winter are laid 
up in the summer, and well cured: our drink was water, mixed with aqua-vi^ 
instead of brandy; and for a treat, mead instead of wine, which, however, they 
have very good. The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, frequently 
brought us in fine venison, and sometimes bear’s flesh, but we did not much 
care for the last. We had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our 
friends, and we lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the weather at 
least tolerable; so the other travellers began to prepare sledges to carry them 
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going; but my measures being 
fixed, as 1 have said, for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made 
no motion; knowing very well that the ships from the south do not set out for 
that part of the world till May or June, and that if I was there by the beginning 
of August, it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away; and 
therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did: in a word, I saw a great 
many people, nay, all the travellers, go away before me. It seems every year

thejr go from thence to Muscovy for trade, to carry furs, and buy necessaries, 
which they bring back with them to furnish their shops: also others went on 
the same errand to Archangel; but then they, all being to come back again 
above eight hundred miles, went out before me. 

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up; and, as I was 
doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these people were banished by 
the CzzT of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were left at 
liberty to go whither they would, why they did not then go away to any part 
of the world, wherever they thought fit: and 1 began to examine what should 
hinder them from making such an attempt. But my wonder was over when I 
entered upon that subject with the person I have mentioned, who answered ^me 
thus. ‘‘Consider, first, sir,” said he, “the place where we are; and, secondly, 
the condition we are in; especially the generality of the people who arc 
banished hither. We are surrounded with stronger things than bars or bolts; 
on the north side, an unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed, and bo^t 
never swam; every other way we have above a thousand miles to pass through 
the Czar’s own dominions, and by ways utterly impassable, except by the 
roads made by the government, and through the towns garrisoned by his 
troops; so that we could neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor subsist any 
other way; so that it is in vain to attempt it.” 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in a prison every 
jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at Moscow: however, 
it came into my thoughts that I might certainly be made an instrument to 
procure the escape of this excellent person; and that, whatever hazard I ran, I 
would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this, I took an occasion, 
one evening, to tell him my thoughts. 1 represented to him that it was very 
easy for me to carry him away, there being no guard over him in the country; 
and as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that 1 went in the 
retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns 
in the desert, but could encamp every night where 1 would, we might easily 
pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where 1 would immediately secure him on 
board an English ship, and carry him safe along with me; and as to his sub- 
sistence and other particulars, it should be my care till he could better supply 
himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the while 1 
spoke; nay, I could see in his very face that what I said put his spirits into 
an exceeding ferment; his color frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and 
his heart fluttered, till it might be even perceived in his countenance; nor could 
he immediately answer me when I had done, and, as ft were, hesitated what 
he would say to it: but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, and said, 
"jHow unhappy are we, unguarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest 
Acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made tempters of one 
another! My dear friend,” said he, “your offer is so sincere, has such kindness 
in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage, that I 
must have very little knowledge of the world if I did not both wonder at it, 
and acknowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did you 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 351 

believe I was sincere in what I have often said to you of my contempt of the 
world^ Did you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had really 
obtained that degree of felicity here that had placed me above all that die 
world could give me? Did you believe I was sincere when 1 told you I would 
not go back, if I was recalled even to be all that I once was in the court, with 
tlie favor of the Czar my master? Did you believe me, my friend, to be an 
honest man; or did you believe me to be a boasting hypocrite?” Here he 
stopped, as if he would hear what 1 would say, but, indeed, I soon after per- 
ccn ed that he stopped because his spirits were in motion, his great heart was 
full of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, 1 confess, astonished at the 
thing as well as at the man, and 1 used some arguments with him to urge him 
to set himself free, that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven 
for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, who has the care and 
disposition of all events, to do himself good, and to render himself useful in 
the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself. “How do you know, sir,” says he, 
warmly, *l)ut that, instead of a summons from Heaven, it may be a^feint of 
another instrument, representing in alluring colors to me the show of felicity 
as a deliverance, which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my 
ruin^ Here I am free from the temptation of returning to my former miserable 
greatness; there I am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, 
and luxury, which I know remain in nature, may revive, and take root, and, 
in a word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy prisoner, whom you see 
now master of his souks liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his own senses, 
in the full enjoyment of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in this 
blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life, rather than purchase a 
show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the future 
happiness which I now have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose 
sight of; for I am but flesh; a man, a mere man; have passions and affections 
as likely to possess and overthrow me as any man: O, be not my friend and 
tempter both together’” 

If 1 was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood silent, looking 
at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw. The struggle in his soul was so 
great that, though the weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most 
violent sweat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his mind, so I said a word 
or two, that I would Icav e him to consider of it, and wait on him again, and 
then I withdrew to my own apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the door of my room, 
and I was going to open the door; but he had opened it and come in. “My 
dear friend,” says he, “you had almost overset me, but 1 am recovered. Do not 
take it ill that I do not close with your offer. I assure you it is not for want 
of sense of the kindness of it in you; and I came to make the most sincere 
acknowledgment of it to you, but 1 hope I have got the victory over myself.” 
“My lord,” said I, “I hope you are fully satisfied that you do not resist the 
call of Heaven.” “Sir,” said he, “if it had been from Heaven, the same power 
would have influenced me to have accepted it; but I hope, and am fully satis- 



352 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

ficd^ that it is from Heaven that I decline it, and I have infinite satisfaction in 
die parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still, though not a free 
man/’ 

1 had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to him of my 
having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very 
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of that, and should always 
acknowledge it; and with that he offered me a very fine present of sables,— too 
much, indeed, for me to accept from a man in his circumstances, and I would 
have avoided them, but he would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a small present of 
tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, 
which did not all weigh above six ounces or thereabouts, but were far shor\: of 
the value of his sables, which, when 1 came to England, I found worth near 
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and 
one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, 
which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any more: and 
he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak with me. 

When 1 came to him, he told me 1 knew what had passed between us, and 
hoped I would not move him any more in that affair; bur that, since I had 
made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had kindness enough to 
offer the same to another person that he would name to me, in whom he had 
a great share of concern. I told him that I could not say I inclined to do so 
much for any but himself, for whom 1 had a particular value, and should have 
been glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance, however, if he would 
please to name the person to me, I would give him my answer. He told me it 
was his only son; who, though 1 had not seen him, yet was in the same condi- 
tion with himself, and above two hundred miles from him, on the other side 
of the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him 1 would do it. 1 made some ceremony in 
letting him understand that it was wholly on his account; and that, seeing 1 
could not prevail on him, I would show my respect to him by my concern 
for his son; but these things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent the next 
day for his son; and in about twenty days he came back with the messenger, 
bringing six or seven horses, loaded with very rich furs, which, in the whole, 
amounted to a very great value. His servants brought the horses into the town, 
but left the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito into 
our apartment, and his father presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted 
the manner of our travelling, and everything proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black foxskins, fine ermines, 
and such other furs as are very rich in that city, in exchange for some of the 
goods I had brought from China; in particular for the cloves and nutmegs, ot 
which I sold the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a 
much better price than I could have got at London; and my partner, who was 
sensible of the profit, and whose business, more particularly than mine, was 
merchandise, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the traffic we 
made here. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 3S3 

It WAS the beginning of June when I left this remote place; a city, I believe, 
little heard of in the world; and, indeed, it is so far out of the road of com- 
merce, that 1 know not how it should be much talked of. We were now 
reduced to a very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels in 
all, and all of them passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of 
eleven of them; it was most natural also that I should take more servants with 
me than I had before; and the young lord passed for my steward; what great 
man I passed for myself, I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. Wc 
had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in our 
whole journey; 1 call it the worst, because the way was very deep in some 
places, and \ ery uneven in others; the best we had to say for it was, that we 
thought we had no troops of Tartars or robbers to fear, and that they never 
came on this side the River Oby, or at least very seldom; but wx found 
it otherwise. 

My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly acquainted 
with the country, and led us by private roads, so that we avoided coming into 
the principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen, Soloy 
Kamskoi, and several others; because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept 
there are very curious and strict in their observation upon travellers, and 
searching lest any of the banished persons of note should make their escape 
that way into Muscovy; but, by this means, as we were kept out of the cities, 
so our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie 
in our tents, when we might have had very good accommodation in the cities 
on the way; this the young lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us 
to he abroad when w^e came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad him- 
self, with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed places. 

We had just entered Europe, having passed the River Kama, which in these 
parts is the boundary betw'een Europe and Asia, and the first city on the 
European side was called Soloy Kamskoi, which is as much as to say, the 
great city on the River Kama; and here we thought to see some evident altera- 
tion in the people; but we w ere mistaken; for as wc had a vast desert to pass, 
which is near seven hundred miles long in some places, but not above two 
hundred miles over where we passed it, so till we came past that horrible 
place, we found very little difference between that country and the Mogul 
Tartary; the people arc mostly pagans, and little better than the savages of 
America; their houses and towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly 
barbarous, except in the cities, and the villages near them, where they are 
Christians, as they call themselves, of the Greek church; but have their religion 
mingled with so many relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in 
some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must (after all our dangers were, 
to our imagination, escaped) have been plundered and robbed, and perhaps 
niurdered, by a troop of thieves; of what country they were, 1 am yet at a 
, loss to know; but they were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and 
were at first about forty-five in number; they came so near to us as to be 
within two musket-shots, and asking no questions, surrounded us with their 



354 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

horses, and looked earnestly upon us twice; at length, they placed themselves 

i ’ust in our way; upon which we drew up in a little line, before our camels, 
>emg not above sixteen men in all; and, being drawn up thus, we halted and 
sent out the Siberian servant, who attended his lord, to see who they were; 
his master was the more willing to let him go, because he was not a little 
apprehensive that they were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man 
came up nearer them with a flag of truce, and called to them; but though he 
spoke several of their languages, or dialects of languages rather, he could not 
understand a word they said; however, after some signs to him not to come 
near them at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he went; only that 
by their dress, he said, he believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, at of 
the Circassian hordes, and that there must be more of them upon the gijeat 
desert, though he never heard that any of them were seen so far north before. 

About an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us, and rode round 
our little wood to see where they might break in; but finding us always ready 
to face them, they went off again; and we resolved not to stir for that night. 

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy; there was, on 
our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a little grove, and very 
near the road; 1 immediately rcsohed we should advance to those trees, and 
fortify ourselves as well as we could there; for, first, 1 considered that the 
trees would in a great measure cover us from their arrows; and, in the next 
place, they could not come to charge us in a bod)'; it was, indeed, my old 
Portuguese pilot w'ho proposed it, and who had this excellency attending him, 
that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases 
of the most danger. We advanced immediately, with what speed we could, 
and gained that little wood; the Tartars, or thieves,— for we knew not what to 
call them,— keeping their stand, and not attempting to hinder us. When we 
came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece 
of ground, and on the one side a very great spring of water, which running 
out in a little brook, was a little farther joined by another of the like size; 
and was, in short, the source of a considerable river, called afterwards the 
Wirtska; the trees which grew abourthis spring were not above two hundred, 
but very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we saw 
ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they attacked us on foot. 

While we staid here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours, without 
perceiving that they made any movement, our Portuguese, with some help, 
cut several arms of trees half off, and laid them hanging across from one tree 
to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About two hours before night, 
they came down directly upon us; and though we had not perceived it, we 
found they had been joined by some more, so that they were near fourscore 
hqrse; whereof, however, we fancied some were women. They came on till 
they were within half-shot of our little wood, when we fired one musket 
wiAout ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue to know what they 
wanted, and bade them keep off; but they came on with a double fury up to 
the wood side, not imagining we were so barricaded that they could not easily 
break in. Our old pilot was our captain, as well as our engineer, and desired us 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 355 

not to fire upon them till they came within pistol-shot, that we might be sure 
to killi and that when we did fire we should be sure to take good aim; we 
bade him give the word of command, which he delayed so long, that they 
were some of them within two pikes’ length of us when we let fly. We aimed 
so true, that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others, as also 
several of their horses, for we had all of us loaded our pieces with two or 
three bullets at least. 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immediately about 
one hundred rods from us; in which time we loaded our pieces again, and 
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and caught four or five of their 
horses, whose riders we supposed were killed; and coming up to the dead, we 
judged they were Tartars, but knew not how they came to make an excursion 
such an unusual length. 

We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of the night in 
strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances into the wood, and 
keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a 
very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the enemy, who we thought were 
discouraged with the reception they met with, were now greatly increased, 

! and had set up eleven or wclve huts or tents, as if they ere resolved to besiege 
us; and this little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three 
quarters of a mile from us. We were indeed surprised at this discovery; and 
now, 1 confess, I gave nij'self over for lost, and all that 1 had; the loss of my 
effects did not he so near me, though very considerable, as the thoughts of 
falling into the hands of such barbarians, at the latter end of my journey, after 
so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone through, and even in sight of 
our port, where wc expected safety and deliverance. As to my partner, he was 
raging, and declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin, and that he 
would rather die than be starved, and he was for fighting to the last drop. 

The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fighting to the last also; and my old 
pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist them all in the situation we 
vere then in; and thus we spent the day in debates of wffiat we should do: but 
towards evening w e found that the number of our enemies still increased, and 
^vc did not know but by the morning they might still be a greater number; so 
I began to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolsk!, if there 
vere no private ways by which we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps 
retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over the desert. The Siberian, 
pvho w as servant to the young lord, told us, if wc designed to avoid them, and 
not fight, he w^ould engage to carry us off in the night, to a way that went 
north, towards the River Petrou, by which he made no question but we might 
get away, and the Tartars never discover it; but he said, his lord had told him 
ne would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight. I told him he mistook 
his lord; for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it; that 
I knew his lord was brave enough, by what he had showed already; but that his 
Potd knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight five 
iiundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it; and that if he 
" ought possible for us to escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to 



356 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

attempt it. He answered, if his lordship gave him such orders, he would lose 
his life if he did not perform it; we soon brought his lord to give that order 
though privately, and we immediately prepared for putting it in practice. 

And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in our little camp, 
which we kept burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all night, that the 
Tartars might conclude we were still there, but as soon as it was dark, and we 
could see the stars (for our guide would not stir before), having all our horses 
and camels ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who I soon found steered 
himself by the north star. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be lighter still; not 
that it was dark all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in short, ^t was 
rather lighter than we wished it to be; but by six o'clock the next morning, we 
had got above thirty miles, having almost spoiled our horses. Here we found 
a Russian village, named Kermazinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing 
of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours before night, we set out 
again, and travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite so hard as 
before; and about seven o’clock, we passed a little river, called Kirtza, and 
came to a good large town inhabited by Russians, called Ozomoys; there vc 
heard that several troops of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but 
that we were now completely out of danger of them, which was to our great 
satisfaction. Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses, and having need 
enough of rest, we staid five days; and my partner and I agreed to give the 
honest Siberian who brought us thither the value of ten pistoles. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima upon the River Wirtzogda, and 
running into the Dwina: we were there, very happily, near the end of our 
travels by land, that river being navigable, in seven days’ passage, to Archangel 
From hence, we came to Lawrenskoy, the 3rd of July; and, providing ourselves 
with two luggage boats, and a barge for our own convenience, we embarlicd 
the 7th, and arrived all safe at Archangel the i8th; having been a year, five 
months, and three days on the journey, including our stay of eight months at 
Tobolski. We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the 
ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburger come in above a 
month sooner than any of the fiiglish ships; when, after some consideration 
that the city of Hamburg might happen to be as good a market for our goods ; 
as London, we all took freight with him; and, having put our goods on board,' 
it was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take care of them, 
by which means, my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, 
never coming on shore again all the time we staid there^ and this he did thit 
he might not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow merchants would 
certainly have seen and discovered him. 

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same year; and, 
after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the Elbe the i8th of Sep- 
tember. Here my partner and I found a very good sale for our goods, as well 
those of China, as the sables, &c., of Siberia; and, dividing the produce, mV 
share amounted to £3475 I'js, ^d,, including about six hundred pounds’ worth 
of diamonds, which I purchased at Bengal. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 357 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up die Elbe, in ordw t» 
go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and could 
correspond with those of his father’s friends who were left alive. He did not 
part without testimonies of gratitude for the service I had done him, and for 
my kindness to the prince his father. 

To conclude: having staid near four months m Hamburg, I came from 
thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived in 
London the loth of January, 1705, having been absent from England ten years 
and nine months. And here I resolved to prepare for a longer journey than all 
these, having lived a life of infinite variety seventy-two years, and learned 
sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and the blessing of ending our 
days in peace. 




A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 




A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 


It was about the beginning of September 1664, that I, among the rest of my 
neighbours, heard, in ordinary discourse, that the plague was returned again 
in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam 
and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said 
from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods, which were brought 
home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others 
from Cyprus. It matter not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come 
into Holland again. 

We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours 
and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have 
lived to see practised since. But such things as those were gathered from the 
letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them was 
handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly 
over the whole nation, as they do now. But it seems that the Government had 
a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its 
coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence it was that this rumour 
died off again, and people began to forget it, as a thing we were very little 
concerned in, and that we hoped was not true, till the latter end of November 
or the beginning of December 1664, when two men, said to be Frenchmen, 
died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. 
The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but 
as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Secre- 
taries of State got knowledge of it, and concerning themselves to inquire about 
It, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were 
ordered to go to the house and make inspection. This they did; and finding 
evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave 
their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon it was given 
in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed 
in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner, thus— 

Flaguc, 2, Parishes infected, /. 

The people showed a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed all over 
the town, and the more, because in the last week in December 1664 another 
man died in the same house, and of the same distemper. And then we were 
easy again for about six weeks, when none having died with any marks of 
infection, it was said the distemper was gone; but after that, I think it was 
about the 12th of February, another died in another house, but in the same 
; parish and in the same manner. 

This turned the people’s eyes pretty much towards that end of the town, and 
^he weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St. Giles’s parish more than 
usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that 
I end of the town, and that many had died of it, though they had taken care to 
it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible. This possessed 

361 



362 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


the heads of the people very much, and few cared to go through Drury Lane, 
or the other streets suspected, unless they had extraordinary business, that 
obliged them to it. 

This increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of burials in a week, 
in the parishes of St, Giles-in-the-Fields and St. Andrew, Holborn, were from 
twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few more or less; but from the time that 
the plague first began in St. Giles’s parish, it was observed that the ordinary 
burials increased in number considerably. For example:—

The like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St, Bride, 
adjoining on one side of Holborn parish, and in the parish of St. James, 
Clerkenwell, adjoining on the other side of Holborn; in both which parishes 
the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to six or eight, whereas 
at that time they were increased as follows:—

Besides this, it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that the 
weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks, although it 
was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate. 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 363 

The usual number of burials within the biUs of mortality for a week was 
from about 240 or thereabouts to 300. The last was esteemed a pretty high 
bill; but after this we found the bills successively increasing, as follows:— 


Buried. Increased. 

December the 20th to the 27th 291 

“ 27th “ 3rd January .... ... 349 58 

January the 3rd “ loth “ 394 45 

“ loth “ 17th “ 415 21 

“ 17th “ 24th “ 474 59 


This last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than had been 
known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of 1656. 

However, all this went off again, and the weather proving cold, and the 
frost, which began in December, still continuing very severe, even till near the 
end of February, attended with sharp though moderate winds, the bills 
decreased again, and the city grew healthy, and everybody began to look upon 
the danger as good as over; only that still the burials in St. Giles’s continued 
high. From the beginning of April especially they stood at twenty-five each 
week, till the week from the i8th to the 25th, when there was buried in St. 
Giles’s parish thirty, whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted-fever, 
which was looked upon as the same thing; likewise the number that died of 
the spotted-fever in the whole increased, being eight the week before, and 
twelve the week above named. 

This alarmed us all again, and terrible apprehensions were among the people, 
especially the weather being now changed and growing warm, and the summer 
being at hand. However, the next week there seemed to be some hopes again; 
the bills were low, the number of the dead in all was but 388, there was none 
of the plague, and but four of the spotted-fever. 

But the following week it returned again, and the distemper was spread into 
two or three other parishes, viz., St. Andrew’s, Holborn; St. Clement Danes; 
and, to the great affliction of the city, one died within the walls, in the parish 
of St. Mary Woolchurch, that is to say, in Bearbinder Lane, near Stocks 
Market; in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted-fever. It 
was, however, upon inquiry, found that this Frenchman who died in Bear- 
binder Lane was one who, having lived in Long Acre, near the infected houses, 
had removed for fear of the distemper, not knowing that he was already 
infected. 

This was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable, and 
cool enough, and people had stiU some hopes. That which encouraged them 
was, that the city was healthy, the whole ninety-seven parishes buried but 
fifty-four, and we began to hope, that as it was chiefly among the people at 
that end of the town, it might go no farther; and the rather, because the next 
week, which was from the 9th of May to the i6th, there died but three, of 
which not one within the whole city or liberties; and St. Andrew’s buried but 
fifteen, which was very low. ’Tis true St. Giles’s buried two-and-thirty, but 
^ill, as there was but one of the plague, people began to be easy. The whole 



364 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

bill also was very low, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week 
above mentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days, but it 
was but for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus; they 
searched the houses, and found that the plague was really spread every way, 
and that many died of it every day. So that now all our extenuations abated, 
and it was no more to be concealed, nay, it quickly appeared that the infection 
had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement; that in the parish of St. Giles 
it was gotten into several streets, and several families lay all sick together, 
and, accordingly, in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show 
itself. There was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague, but this w;|is all 
knavery and collusion, for in St. Giles’s parish they buried forty in all, whereof 
it was certain most of them died of the plague, though they were set doWh of 
other distempers; and though the number of all the burials were not increased 
above thirty-two, and the whole bill being but 385, yet there was fourteen of 
the spotted-fever, as well as fourteen of the plague; and we took it for granted 
upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague. 

The next bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the number of the 
plague was seventeen. But the burials in St. Giles’s were fifty-three— a frightful 
number!— of whom they set down but nine of the plague; but on an examina- 
tion more strictly by the justices of the peace, and at the Lord Mayor’s 
request, it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the 
plague in that parish, but had been set down of the spotted-fever or other 
distempers, besides others concealed. 

But those were trifling things to what followed immediately after; for now 
the weather set in hot, and from the first week in June the infection spread in 
a dreadful manner, and the bills rose high; the articles of the fever, spotted- 
fever, and teeth began to swell; for all that could conceal their distempers did 
it, to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them, 
and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses, which though it was not 
yet practised, yet was threatened, and people were extremely terrified at the 
thoughts of it. 

The second week in June, the parish of St. Giles, where still the weight of 
the infection lay, buried 120, whereof, though the bills said but sixty-eight of 
the plague, everybody said there had been 100 at least, calculating it from the 
usual number of funerals in that parish, as above. 

Till this week the city continued free, there having never any died, except 
that one Frenchman whom I mentioned before, within the whole ninety-seven 
parishes. Now there died four within the city, one in Wood Street, one in 
Fenchurch Street, and two in Crooked Lane. Southwark was entirely free, 
having not one yet died on that side of the water. 

I lived without Aldgatc, about midway between Aldgate Church and White- 
4:hapel Bars, on the left hand or north side of the street; and as the distemper 
^ad not reached to that side of the city, our neighbourhood continued very 
easy. But at the other end of the town their consternation was very great; and 
the richer sort of people, especially the nobility and gentry from the west part 
of the city, thronged out of town with their families and servants in an unusual 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 36S 

manner; and this was more particularly seen in Whitechapel; that is to say, the 
Broad Street where I lived; indeed, nothing was to be seen but waggons and 
carts, with goods, women, servants, children, &c.; coaches filled with people of 
the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away; then 
empty waggons and carts appeared, and spare horses with servants, who, it was 
apparent, were returning or sent from the countries to fetch more people; 
besides innumerable numbers of men on horseback, some alone, others with 
servants, and, generally speaking, all loaded with baggage and fitted out for 
travelling, as any one might perceive by their appearance. 

This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and as it was a sight 
which I could not but look on from morning to night, for indeed there was 
nothing else of moment to be seen, it filled me with very serious thoughts of 
the misery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy condition of those 
that would be left in it. 

This hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no getting 
at the Lord Mayor’s door without exceeding difficulty; there was such press- 
ing and crowding there to get passes and certificates of health for such as 
travelled abroad, for without these there was no being admitted to pass through 
the towns upon the road, or to lodge in any inn. Now, as there had none died 
in the city for all this time, my Lord Mayor gave certificates of health without 
any difficulty to all those who lived in the ninety-seven parishes, and to those 
within the liberties too for a while. 

This hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to say, all the month of 
May and June, and the more because it was rumoured that an order of the 
Government was to be issued out to place turnpikes and barriers on the road 
to prevent people travelling, and that the towns on the road would not suffer 
people from London to pass for fear of bringing the infection along with 
them, though neither of these rumours had any foundation but in the imagina- 
tion, especially at first. 

1 now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own case, and 
how I should dispose of myself; that is to say, whether I should resolve to stay 
in London or shut up my house and flee, as many of my neighbours did. I have 
set this particular down so fully, because 1 know not but it may be of moment 
to those who come after me, if they come to be brought to the same distress, 
and to the same manner of making their choice; and therefore I desire this 
account may pass with them rather for a direction to themselves to act by than 
a history of my actings, seeing it may not be of one farthing value to them to 
note what became of me. 

1 had two important things before me: the one was the carrying on my 
business and shop, which was considerable, and in which was embarked all my 
effects in the world; and the other was the preservation of my life in so dismal 
a calamity as I saw apparently was coming upon the whole city, and which, 
however great it was, my fears perhaps, as well as other people’s, represented 
to be much greater than it could be. 

The first consideration was of great moment to mc; my trade was a sadlcr, 
and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade, but among the 



366 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

merchants trading to the English colonies in America, so my effects lay very 
much in the hands of such. I was a single man, ’tis true, but I had a family of 
servants whom I kept at my business; had a house, shop, and warehouses filled 
with goods; and, in short, to leave them all as things in such a case must be 
left, that is to say, without any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them, 
had been to hazard the loss not only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed 
of all 1 had in the world. 

I had an elder brother at the same time in London, and not many years 
before come over from Portugal, and advising with him, his answer was in 
three words, the same that was given in another case quite different, viz., 
“Master, save thyself.” In a word, he was for my retiring into the country, as 
he resolved to do himself with his family; telling me, what he had, it sciems, 
heard abroad, that the best preparation for the plague was to run away from it. 
As to my argument of losing my trade, my goods, or debts, he quite confuted 
me. He told me the same thing which I argued for my staying, viz., that I 
would trust God with my safety and health, was the strongest repulse to my 
pretensions of losing my trade and my goods; “for,” says he, “is it not as 
reasonable that you should trust God with the chance or risk of losing your 
trade, as that you should stay in so eminent a point of danger, and trust Him 
with your life?” 

I could not argue that I was in any strait as to a place where to go, having 
several friends and relations in Northamptonshire, whence our family first 
came from; and particularly, 1 had an only sister in Lincolnshire, very willing 
to receive and entertain me. 

My brother, who had already sent his wife and two children into Bedford- 
shire, and resolved to follow them, pressed my going very earnestly; and I had 
once resolved to comply with his desires, but at that time could get no horse, 
for though it is true all the people did not go out of the city of London, yet 1 
may venture to say, that in a manner all the horses did; for there was hardly a 
horse to be bought or hired in the whole city for some weeks. Once I resolved 
to travel on foot with one servant, and, as many did, lie at no inn, but carry 
a soldier’s tent with us, and so lie in the fields, the weather being very warm, 
and no danger from taking cold. I, say, as many did, because several did so at 
last, especially those who had been in the armies in the war which had not been 
many years past; and I must needs say that, speaking of second causes, had 
most of the people that travelled done so, the plague had not been carried into 
so many country towns and houses as it was, to the great damage, and indeed 
to the ruin, of abundance of people. 

But then my servant, whom I had intended to take down with me, deceived 
me; and being frighted at the increase of the distemper, and not knowing when 
I should go, he took other measures, and left me, so I was put off for that time; 
and, one way or other, 1 always found that to appoint to go away was always 
crossed by some accident or other, so as to disappoint and put it off again; and 
this brings in a story which otherwise might be thought a needless digression, 
viz., about these disappointments being from Heaven. 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 367 

I menrion this storjr al$o>as the best method I can advise any person to take 
in such a case, especially if he be one that makes conscience of his duty, and 
would be directed what to do in it, namely, that he should keep his eye upon 
rhc particular providences which occur at that time, and look upon them com- 
ple^dy, as they regard one another, and as all together regard the question 
before him, and then, I think, he may safely take them for intimations from 
Heaven of what is his unquestioned duty to do in such a case; 1 mean as to 
going away from or staying in the place where we dwell, when visited with 
an infectious distemper. 

It came very warmly into my mind one morning, as I was musing on this 
particular thing, that as nothing attended us without the direction or permis- 
sion of Divine Power, so these disappointments must have something in them 
extraordinary, and I ought to consider whether it did not evidently point out, 
or intimate to me, that it was the will of Heaven I should not go. It immedi- 
ately followed in my thoughts, that if it really was from God that I should stay. 
He was able effectually to preserve me in the midst of all the death and 
danger that would surround me, and that if I attempted to secure myself by 
fleeing from my habitation, and acted contrary to these intimations, which I 
believed to be Divine, it was a kind of flying from God, and that He could 
cause His justice to overtake me when and where He thought fit. 

These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again, and when I came to 
discourse with my brother again, I told him that I inclined to stay and take 
my lot in that station in which God had placed me, and that it seemed to be 
made more especially my duty, on the account of what I have said. 

My brother, though a very religious man himself, laughed at all I had sug- 
gested about its being an intimation from Heaven, and told me several stories 
of such foolhardy people, as he called them, as I was; that I ought indeed to 
submit to it as a work of Heaven if I had been any way disabled by distempers 
or diseases, and that then not being able to go, I ought to acquiesce in the 
direction of Him, who, having been my Maker, had an undisputed right of 
sovereignty in disposing of me, and that then there had been no difficulty 
to determine which was the call of His providence and which was not; but 
that I should take it as an intimation from Heaven that I should not go out of 
town, only because 1 could not hire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away 
that was to attend me, was ridiculous, since at the same time I had my health 
and limbs, and other servants, and might with ease travel a day or two on foot, 
and having a good certificate of being in perfect health, might either hire a 
horse or take post on the road, as I thought fit. 

Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences which 
attended the presumption of the Turks and Mahometans in Asia and in other 
places where he had been (for my brother, being a merchant, was a few years 
before, as 1 have already observed, returned from abroad, coming last from 
Lisbon), and how, presuming upon their professed predestinating notions, and 
of every man’s end being predetermined and unalterably beforehand decreed, 
they would go unconcerned into infected places and converse with infected 
persons, by which means they died at the rate of ten or fifteen thousand a 



368 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

week, whereas the Europeans or Christian merchants, who kept themselves 
retired and reserved, generally escaped the contagion. 

Upon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again, and I 
began to resolve to go, and accordingly made all things ready; for, in short, 
the infection increased round me, and the bills were risen to almost seven 
hundred a week, and my brother told me he would venture to stay no longer. 
I desired him to let me consider of it but till the next day, and I would resolve; 
and as 1 had already prepared everything as well as I could as to my business, 
and whom to entrust my affairs with, I had little to do but to resolve. 

I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind, irresolute, aitd not 
knowing what to do. I had set the evening wholly apart to consider seriously 
about it, and was all alone; for already people had, as it were by a geheral 
consent, taken up the custom of not going out of doors after sunset; the 
reasons I shall have occasion to say more of by-and-by. 

In the retirement of this evening 1 endeavoured to resolve, first, what was 
my duty to do, and 1 stated the arguments with which my brother had pressed 
me to go into the country, and I set against them the strong impressions which 
I had on my mind for staying; the visible call 1 seemed to have from the 
particular circumstance of my calling, and the care due from me for the 
preservation of my effects, which were, as I might say, my estate; also the 
intimations which I thought I had from Heaven, that to me signified a kind of 
direction to venture, and it occurred to me, that if 1 had what I might call a 
direction to stay, I ought to suppose it contained a promise of being preserved 
if I obeyed. 

This lay close to me, and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to 
stay than ever, and supported with a secret satisfaction that 1 should be kept. 
Add to this, that, turning over the Bible which lay before me, and while my 
thoughts were more than ordinarily serious upon the question, 1 cried out, 
“Well, 1 know not what to do; Lord, direct me!” and the like; and at that 
juncture I happened to stop turning over the book at the 91 st Psalm, and 
casting my eye on the second verse, I read on to the seventh verse exclusive, 
and after that included the tenth, as follows: “I will say of the Lord, He is my 
refuge and my fortress: my God, in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver 
thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall 
cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust. His truth 
shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by 
night; nor for the arrow that flicth by day, nor for the pestilence that walketh 
in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall 
fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh 
thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and sec the reward of the wicked. 
Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, 
thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come 
nkh thy dwelling,” &c. 

1 scarce need tell the reader that from that moment I resolved that I would 
«tay in the town, and casting myself entirely upon the goodness and protection 
of the Almighty, would not seek any other shelter whatever; and that, as my 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 369 

times were in His hands, He was as able to keep me in a time of the infection 
as in a time of health; and if He did not think fit to deliver me, still I was in 
His hands, and it was meet He should do with me as should seem good to Him, 

With this resolution I went to bed; and I was further confirmed in it the 
next day by the woman being taken ill with whom I had intended to entrust 
iny house and all my affairs. But I had a further obligation laid on me on the 
same side, for the next day I found myself very much out of order also, so 
that if I would have gone away, 1 could not; and i continued ill three or four 
days, and this entirely determined my stay; so I took my leave of my brother, 
who went away to Dorking, in Surrey, and afterwards fetched a round farther 
into Buckinghamshire or Bedfordshire, to a retreat he had found out there for 
his family. 

It was a very ill time to be sick in, for if any one complained, it was immedi- 
ately said he had the plague; and though I had indeed no symptoms of that 
distemper, yet being very ill, both in my head and in my stomach, I was not 
without apprehension that I really was infected; but in about three days I grew 
better; the third night I rested well, sweated a little, and was much refreshed. 
The apprehensions of its being the infection went also quite away with my 
illness, and I went about my business as usual. 

These things, however, put off all my thoughts of going into the country; 
and my brother also being gone, I had no more debate either with him or with 
myself on that subject. 

It was now mid-July, and the plague, which had chiefly raged at the other 
end of the town, and, as I said before, in the parishes of St. Giles, St. Andrew, 
Holborn, and towards Westminster, began to now come eastward towards the 
part where I lived. It was to be observed, indeed, that it did not come straight 
on towards us; for the city, that is to say, within the walls, was indifferently 
healthy still; nor was it got then very much over the water into Southwark; 
for though there died that week 1268 of all distempers, whereof it might be 
supposed above 900 died of the plague, yet there was but twenty-eight in the 
whole city, within the walls, and but nineteen in Southwark, Lambeth parish 
included, whereas in the parishes of St. Giles and St. Marrimin-the-Fields alone 
there died 421. 

But we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out-parishes, which being 
very populous, and fuller also of poor, the distemper found more to prey upon 
than in the city, as I shall observe afterwards. We perceived, I say, the dis- 
temper to draw our way, viz., by the parishes of Clerkenwell, Cripplegate, 
Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last too parishes joining to Aldgate, 
Whitechapel, and Stepney, the infection came at length to spread its utmost 
tage and violence in those parts, even when it abated at the western parishes 
where it began. 

It was very strange to observe that in this particular week, from the 4th to the 
nth of July, when, as 1 have observed, there died near 400 of the plague in the 
two parishes of St. Martin and St. Giles-in-the-Fields only, there died in the 
parish of Aldgate but four, in the parish of Whitechapel three, in the parish of 
Stepney but one. 



370 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Likewise in the next week, from the nth of July to the i8th, when the 
week's bill was 1761, yet there died no more of the plague, on the whole 
Southwark side of the water, than sixteen. 

But this face of things soon changed, and it began to thicken in Cripplegate 
parish especially, and in Clerkcnwell; so that by the second week in August, 
Cripplegate parish alone buried 886, and Clerkenwell 155. Of the first, 850 
might well be reckoned to die of the plague; and of the last, the bill itself said 
145 were of the plague. 

During the month of July, and while, as I have observed, our part of the 
town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part, I went ordinarily 
about the streets, as my business required, and particularly went generally once 
in a day, or in two days, into the city, to my brother’s house, which hei had 

P Ven me charge of, and to see if it was safe; and having the key in my pocket, 
used to go into the house, and over most of the rooms, to see that all was 
well; for though it be something wonderful to tell, that any should have hearts 
so hardened in the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal, yet certain it 
is that all sorts of villainies, and even levities and debaucheries, were then 
practised in the town as openly as ever— I will not say quite as frequently, 
because the numbers of people were many ways lessened. 

But the city itself began now to be visited too, I mean within the walls; but 
the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by so great a 
multitude having been gone into the country; and even all this month of July 
they continued to flee, though not in .such multitudes as formerly. In August, 
indeed, they fled in such a manner that I began to think there would be really 
none but magistrates and servants left in the city. 

As they fled now out of the city, so T should observe that the Court removed 
early, viz., in the month of June, and went to Oxford, where it pleased God 
to preserve them; and the distemper did not, as I heard of, so much as touch 
them, for which I cannot say that I ever saw they showed any great token of 
thankfulness, and hardly anything of reformation, though they did not want 
being told that their crying vices might, without breach of charity, be said to 
have gone far in bringing that terrible judgment upon the whole nation. 

The face of London was now indeed strangely altered, 1 mean the whole 
mass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and alto- 
gether; for as to the particular part called the city, or within the walls, that was 
not yet much infected. But in the whole the face of things, I say, was much 
altered; sorrow and sadness sat upon every face; and though some parts were 
not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply concerned/, and as we saw it 
apparently coming on, so every one looked on himself and his family as in the 
utmost danger. Were it possible to represent those times exactly to those that 
*did not see them, and give the reader due ideas of the horror that everywhere 
presented itself, it must make just impressions upon their minds and fill them 
with surprise. London might well be said to be all in tears; the mourners did 
not go about the streets indeed, for nobody put on black or made a formal 
dress of mourning for their nearest friends; but the voice of mourning was 
truly heard in the streets. The shrieks of women and children at the windows 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 371 

and doors of their houses, where their dearest relations were perhaps dying, 
or just dead, were so frequent to be heard as we passed the streets, that it was 
enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the world to hear them. Tears and 
lamentations were seen almost in every house, especially in the first part of the 
visitation; for towards the latter end men’s hearts were hardened, and death 
was so always before their eyes, that they did not so much concern themselves 
for the loss of their friends, expecting that themselves should be summoned 
the next hour. 

Business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town, even when the 
sickness was chiefly there; and as the thing was new to me,' as well as to 
everybody else, it was a most surprising thing to see those streets which were 
usually so thronged now grown desolate, and so few people to be seen in them, 
that if I had been a stranger and at a loss for my way, I might sometimes have 
gone the length of a whole street, I mean of the by-streets, and seen nobody to 
direct me except watchmen set at the doors of such houses as were shut up, of 
which I shall speak presently. 

One day, being at that part of the town on some special business, curiosity 
led me to observe things more than usually, and indeed 1 walked a great way 
where I had no business. I went up Holborn, and there the street was full of 
people, but they walked in the middle of the great street, neither on one side 
or other, because, as I suppose, they would not mingle with anybody that 
came out of houses, or meet with smells and scents from houses that might be 
infected. 

The Inns of Court were all shut up; nor were very many of the lawyers in 
the Temple, or Lincoln’s Inn, or Gray’s Inn, to be seen there. Everybody was 
at peace; there was no occasion for lawyers; besides, it being in the time of the 
vacation too, they were generally gone into the country. Whole rows of 
houses in some places were shut close up, the inhabitants all fled, and only a 
watchman or two left. 

When I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I do not mean shut up by the 
magistrates, but that great numbers of persons followed the Court, by the 
necessity of their employments and other dependences; and as others retired, 
really frighted with the distemper, it was a mere desolating of some of the 
streets. But the fright was not yet near so great in the city, abstractly so called, 
and particularly because, though they were at first in a most inexpressible 
consternation, yet as I have observed that the distemper intermitted often at 
first, so they were, as it were, alarmed and unalarmed again, and this several 
times, till it began to be familiar to them; and that even when it appeared 
yiolent, yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city, or the east and 
jsouth parts, the people began to take courage, and to be, as I may sav, a little 
jliardened. It is true a vast many people fled, as I have observed, yet they were 
jehiefly from the west end of the town, and from that we call the heart of the 
«ity, that is to say, among the wealthiest of the people, and such people as were 
unencumbered with trades and business. But of the rest, the generality stayed, 
and seemed to abide the worst; so that in the place we call the Liberties, and 
m the suburbs, in Southwark, and in the east part, such as Wapping, Ratcliff, 



372 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Stepney, Rotherhithe, and the like, the people generally stayed, except here and 
there a few wealthy families, who, as above, did not depend upon their 
business. 

It must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were prodigiously full 
of people at the time of this visitation, I mean at the time that it began; for 
though I have lived to see a further increase, and mighty throngs of people 
settling in London more than ever, yet we had always a notion that the 
numbers of people which, the wars being over, the armies disbanded, and the 
royal family and the monarchy being restored, had flocked to London to 
settle in business, or to depend upon and attend the Court for rew?irds of 
services, preferments, and the like, was such that the town was computed to 
have in it above a hundred thousand people more than ever it held before; nay, 
some took upon them to say it had twice as many, because all the ruined 
families of the royal party flocked hither. All the old soldiers set up trades 
here, and abundance of families settled here. Again, the Court brought with 
them a great flux of pride and new fashions. All people v/ere grown gay and 
luxurious, and the joy of the Restoration had brought a vast many families to 
London. 

I often thought that as Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans when the 
Jews were assembled together to celebrate the Passover, by which means an in- 
credible number of people were surprised there who would otherwise ha\e 
been in other countries; so the plague entered London when an incredible 
increase of people had happened occasionally, by the particular circumstances 
above named. As this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay Court 
made a great trade in the city, especially in everything that belonged to 
fashion and finery, so it drew by consequence a great number of workmen, 
manufacturers, and the like, being mostly poor people who depended upon 
their labour. And I remember in particular, that in a representation to my l^rd 
Mayor of the condition of the poor, it was estimated that there were no 
less than an hundred thousand riband-weavers in and about the city, the 
chiefest number of whom lived then in the parishes of Shoreditch, Stepney, 
Whitechapel, and Bishopsgate, that, namely, about Spitalfields; that is to 
say, as Spitalfields was then, for it was not so large as now by one fifth part. 

By this, however, the number of people in the whole may be judged of; and, 
indeed, I often wondered that, after the prodigious numbers of people that 
went away at first, there was yet so great a multitude left as it appeared 
there was. 

But I must go back again to the beginning of this surprising time. While 
the fears of the people were young, they were increased strangely by several 
odd accidents, which put altogether, it was really a wonder the whole body 
of the people did not rise as one man and abandon their dwellings, leaving 
the place as a space of ground designed by Heaven for an Aceldama, 
doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth, and that all that would 
be found in it would perish with it. I shall name but a few of these things; 
but sure they were so many, and so many wizards and cunning people propa-

S ting them, that I have often wondered there was any (women especially) 
t behind. 

In the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared for several months 
before the plague, as there did the year after another, a little before the fire. 
The old women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the other sex, 
whom I could almost call old women too, remarked (especially afterward, 
though not till both those judgments were over) that those two comets 
passed directly over the city, and that so very near the houses that it was 
plain they imported something peculiar to the city alone; that the comet before 
rhe pestilence was of a faint, dull, languid colour, and its motion very heavy, 
solemn, and slow; but that the comet before the fire was bright and sparkling, 
or, as others said, flaming, and its motion swift and furious; and that accord* 
ingly one foretold a heavy judgment, slow but severe, terrible and frightful, 
as vas the plague; but the other foretold a stroke, sudden, swift, and fiery 
as the conflagration. Nay, so particular some people were, that as they looked 
upon that comet preceding the fire, they fancied that they not only saw it 
pass swiftly and fiercely, and could perceive the motion with their eye, but 
t\cn they heard it; that it made a rushing, mighty noise, fierce and terrible, 
though at a distance, and but just perceivable. 

1 saw both these stars, and, 1 must confess, had so much of the common 
notion of such things in my head, that I was apt to look upon them as the 
forerunners and warnings of God’s judgments; and especially when, after 
the plague had followed the first, I yet saw another of the like kind, I could 
not l)ut say God had not yet suSiciently scourged the city. 

But I could not at the same time carry these things to the height that others 
did, knowing, too, that natural causes are assigned by the astronomers for 
such things, and that their motions and even their revolutions are calculated, 
or pretended to be calculated, so that they cannot be so perfectly called the 
forerunners or foretellers, much less the procurers, of such events as pestilence, 
war, fire, and the like. 

But let my thoughts and the thoughts of the philosophers be, or have been, 
what they will, these things had a more than ordinary influence upon the 
minds of the common people, and they had almost universal melancholy 
apprehensions of some dreadful calamity and judgment coming upon the city; 
and this principally from the sight of this comet, and the little alarm that 
was given in December by two people dying at St. Giles’s, as above. 

The apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased by the 
error of the times, in which, I think, the people, from what principle I cannot 
imagine, were more addicted to prophecies and astrological conjurations, 
dreams, and old wives’ tales than ever they were before or since. Whether 
this unhappy temper was originally raised by the follies of some people who 
got money by it, that is to say, by printing predictions and prognostications, 
1 know not; but certain it is, books frighted them terribly, such as Lilly’s 
A^lmanack, Cadbury’s Astrological Predictions, Poor Robin’s Almanack, and 
the like; also several pretended religious books, one entitled, “Come out of her,

my People, lest you be Partaker of her Plagues;” another called, “Fair Warn- 
inff;” another, “Britain’s Remembrancer;” and many such, all, or most part of 
which, foretold, directly or covertly, the ruin of the city. Nay, some were so 
enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets with their oral predictions, 
pretending they were sent to preach to the city; and one in particular, who,’ 
like Jonah to Nineveh, cried in the streets, “Yet forty days, and London 
shall be destroyed.” I will not be positive whether he said yet forty days or 
yet a few days. Another ran about naked, except a pair of drawers about hi$ 
waist, crying day and night, like a man that Josephus mentions, who cried, 
“Woe to Jerusalem!” a little before the destruction of that city. So this poor 
naked creature cried, “Oh, the great and the dreadful God!” and Jfaid no 
more, but repeated those words continually, with a voice and countenance full 
of horror, a swift pace; and nobody could ever find him to stop or rest, or take 
any sustenance, at least that ever I could hear of. I met this poor creature 
several times in the streets, and would have spoke to him, but he would not 
enter into speech with me or any one else, but held on his dismal cries 
continually. 

These things terrified the people to the last degree, and especially when two 
or three times, as I have mentioned already, they found one or two in the bills 
dead of the plague at St. Giles’s. 

Next to these public things were the dreams of old women, or, I should 
say, the interpretation of old women upon other people’s dreams; and these 
put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices warning 
them to be gone, for that there would be such a plague in London, so that 
the living would not be able to bury the dead. Others saw apparitions in the 
air; and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope without breach of charity, 
that they heard voices that never spake, and saw sights that never appeared, 
but the imagination of the people was really turned wayward and possessed. 
And no wonder, if they who were poring continually at the clouds saw shapes 
and figures, representations and appearances, which had nothing in them but 
air and vapour. Here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand 
coming out of a cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city; there 
they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried; and there again, 
heaps of dead bodies lying unburied, and the like, just as the imagination of 
the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to work upon. 

“So hypochondriac fancies reprCvSent 
Ships, armies, battles in the firmament; 

Tilt steady eyes the exhalations sojvc, # 

And all to its first matter, cloud, resolve.” 

I could fill this account with the strange relations such people gave every 
day of what they had seen; and every one was so positive of their having 
seen what they pretended to see, that there was no contradicting them without 
breach of friendship, or being accounted rude and unmannerly on the one 
hand, and profane and impenetrable on the other. One time before the plague 
was begun (otherwise than as I have said in St, Giles’s), I think it was in

March, seeing a crowd of people in the street, I joined with them to satisfy 
my curiosity, and found them all staring up into the air to see what a woman 
told them appeared plain to her, which was an angel clothed in white, with 
a fiery sword in his hand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She 
described every part of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and 
the form, and the poor people came into it so eagerly, and with so much 
readiness; “Yes, I see it all plainly,” says one; “there’s the sword as plain as 
(»an be.” Another saw the angel. One saw his very face, and cried out what a 
glorious creature he was' One saw one thing, and one another. I looked as 
earnestly as the rest, but perhaps not with so much willingness to be imposed 
upon; and 1 said, indeed, that I could see nothing but a white cloud, bright 
on one side by the shining of the sun upon the other part. The woman endeav- 
oured to show it me, but could not make me confess that I saw it, which, 
indeed, if I had I must have lied. But the woman, turning upon me, looked 
HI my face, and fancied I laughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, 
for 1 really did not laugh, but was very seriously reflecting how the poor 
[people were terrified by the force of their own imagination. However, she 
turned from me, called me profane fellow, and a scoffer; told me that it 
uas a time of God’s anger, and dreadful judgments were approaching, and 
that despisers such as I should wander and perish. 

The people about her seemed disgusted as well as she; and I found there 
vas no persuading them that 1 did not laugh at them, and that I should be 
[rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them. So I left them; and 
his appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself. 

Another encounter 1 had in the open day also, and this was in going through 
. narrow passage from Petty France into Bishopsgate Churchyard, by a row 
)f alms-houses. There are two churchyards to Bishopsgate church or parish; 
me we go over to pass from the place called Petty France into Bishopsgate 
jtreet, coming out ]ust by the church door; the other is on the side of the 
lairow passage where the alms-houses are on the left; and a dwarf-wall with 
palisado on it on the right hand, and the city wall on the other side more 
0 the right. 

In this narrow passage stands a man looking through between the palisadoes 
ato the burying-place, and as many people as the narrowness of the passage 
•vould admit to stop, without hindering the passage of others, and he was 
dking mighty eagerly to them, and pointing now to one place, then to 
nother, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a gravestone 
‘here. He described the shape, the posture, and the movement of it so exactly 
•hat it was the greatest matter of amazement to him in the world that every- 
^od)^ did not see it as well as he. On a sudden he would cry, “There it is; 
low It comes this way.” Then, “ ’Tis turned back;” till at length he persuaded 
;he people into so firm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and another 
ancied he saw it; and thus he came every day making a strange hubbub, con- 
idering it was in so narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck eleven, 
nd then the ghost would seem to start, and, as if he were called away, disap- 
eared on a sudden. 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

I looked earnestly every way, and at the very moment that this man directed, 
but could not see the least appearance of anything; but so positive was this 
poor man, that he gave the people the vapours in abundance, and sent them 
away trembling and frighted, till at length few people that knew of it cared 
to go through that passage, and hardly anybody by night on any account 
whatever. 

This ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs to the houses, and to the 
ground, and to the people, plainly intimating, or else they so understanding 
It, that abundance of the people should come to be buried in that churchyard, 
as indeed happened; but that he saw such aspects 1 must acknowledge 1 never 
believed, nor could 1 see anything of it myself, though I looked most earnestly : 
to see it, if possible. ' 

These things serve to show how far the people were really overcome with 
delusions; and as they had a notion of the approach of a visitation, ail their 
predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague, which should lay the whole 
city, and even the kingdom, waste, and should destroy almost aU the nation, 
both man and beast. 

To this, as I said before, the astrologers added stories of the conjunctions of 
planets in a malignant manner and with a mischievous influence, one of 
which conjunctions was to happen, and did happen, in October, and the other 
in November; and they filled the people’s heads with predictions on these 
signs of the heavens, intimating that those conjunctions foretold drought, 
famine, and pestilence. In the two first of them, however, they were entirely 
mistaken, for we had no droughty season, but in the beginning of the year 
a hard frost, which lasted from December almost to March, and after that 
moderate weather, rather warm than hot, with refreshing winds, and, in 
short, very seasonable weather, and also several very great rains. 

Some endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books as 
terrified the people, and to frighten the dispersers of them, some of whom 
were taken up; but nothing was done in it, as I am informed, the Government 
being unwilling to exasperate the people, who were, as I may say, all out of 
their wits already. 

Neither can I acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather sank than 
lifted up the hearts of their hearers. Many of them no doubt did it for the 
strengthening the resolution of the people, and especially for quickening 
them to repentance, but it certainly answered not their end, at least not in 
proportion to the injury it did another way; and indeed, as God Hiiwelf 
through the whole Scriptures rather draws to Him tjy invitations and calh 
to turn to Him and live, than drives us by terror “and amazement, so I must 
confess I thought the ministers should have done also, imitating our blessed 
Lord and Master in this, that His whole Gospel is full of declarations from 
heaven of God’s mercy, and His readiness to receive penitents and forgive 
them, complaining, “Ye will not come unto Me that ye may have life,’' and 
that therefore His Gospel is called the Gospel of Peace and the Gospel or 
Grace. 

But we had some good men, and that of all persuasions and opinions» 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 377 

fi^hose discourses were full of terror, who spoke nothing but dismal things; 
md as they brought the people together with a kind of horror, sent them 
iway in tears, prophesying nothing but evil tidings, terrifying the people with 
ipprehensions of being utterly destroyed, not guiding them, at least not 
enough, to cry to heaven for mercy. 

It was, indeed, a time of very unhappy breaches among us in matters of 
religion. Innumerable sects and divisions and separate opinions prevailed among 
che people. The Church of England was restored, indeed, with the restoration 
of the monarchy, about four years before, but the ministers and preachers of 
the Presbyterians and Independents, and of all the other sorts of professions, 
had begun to gather separate societies and erect altar against altar, and all 
thcjse had their meetings for worship apart, as they have now, but not so many 
then, the Dissenters being not thoroughly formed into a body as they are 
since; and those congregations which were thus galhe?*cd together were yet 
l)ut few. And even those that were the Government did not allow, bur endeav- 
oured to suppress them and shut up their meetings. 

But the visitation reconciled them again, at least for a time, and many of the 
best and most valuable ministers and preachers of the Dissenters were suffered 
to go into the churches where the incumbents were fled away, as many were, 
not being able to stand it; and the people flocked without distinction to hear 
them preach, not much inquiring who or what opinion they were of. But after 
the sickness was over, that spirit of charity abated; and every church being 
again supplied with their own ministers, or others presented where the minister 
I'was dead, things returned to their old channel again. 

I One mischief always introduces another. These terrors and apprehensions 
of the people led them into a thousand weak, foolish, and wicked things, 
which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them to, 
and this was running about to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and astrologers 
to know their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to have their fortunes 
told them, their nativities calculated, and the like; and this folly presently 
nude the town swarm with a wicked generation of pretenders to magic, to 
the black art, as they called it, and I know not what; nay, to a thousand worse 
dealings with the devil than they were really guilty of. And this trade grew 
open and so generally practised that it became common to have signs 
and inscriptions set up at doors: “Here lives a fortune-teller,” “Here lives 
an astrologer,” “Here you may have your nativity calculated,” and the like; 
and Friar Bacon’s brazen-head, which was the usual sign of these people’s 
dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else the sign of Mother 
Shiuton, or of Merlin’s head, and the like. 

^Vith what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff these oracles of the devil 
pleased and satisfied the people I really know not, but certain it is that 
innumerable attendants crowded about their doors every day. And if but a 
grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a band, and a black cloak, which was the 
babit those quack-conjurers generally w^ent in, was but seen in the streets 
the people would follow them in crowds, and ask them questions as they 
Went along.

I need not mention what a horrid delusion this was, or what it tended to* 
but there was no remedy for it till the plague itself put an end to it all, and’ 
I suppose, cleared the town of most of those calculators themselves. One mis. 
chief was, that if the poor people asked these mock astrologers whether there 
would be a plague or no, they all agreed in general to answer “Yes,*’ fof 
that kept up their trade. And had the people not been kept in a fright about 
that, the wizards would presently have been rendered useless, and their craft 
had been at an end. But they always talked to tJiem of such-and-such influ- 
ences of the stars, of the conjunctions of such-and-such planets, which must 
necessarily bring sickness and distempers, and consequently the plague. And 
some had the assurance to tell them the plague was begun already^ which 
was too true, though they that said so knew nothing of the matter. The 
ministers, to do them justice, and preachers of most sorts that were serious 
and understanding persons, thundered against these and other wicked practices, 
and exposed the folly was well as the wickedness of them together, and the 
most sober and judicious people despised and abhorred them. But it was 
impossible to make any impression upon the middling people and the working 
labouring poor. Their fears were predominant over all their passions, and they 
threw away their money in a most distracted manner upon those whimsies. 
Maid-servants especially, and men-servants, were the chief of their customers, 
and their question generally was, after the first demand of “WiU there be 
a plague?” I say, the next question was, “Oh, sir! for the Lord’s sake, what 
will become of me? Will my mistress keep me, or will she turn me off? Will 
she stay here, or will she go into the country? And if she goes into the countn, 
will she take me with her, or leave me liere to be starved and undone?” And 
the like of men-servants. 

The truth is, the case of poor servants was very dismal, as I shall have occa- 
sion to mention again by-and-by, for it was apparent a prodigious number 
of them would be turned away, and it was so. And of them abundance per- 
ished, and particularly of those that these false prophets had flattered witli 
hopes that they should be continued in their services, and carried with their 
masters and mistresses into the country; and had not public charity provided 
for these poor creatures, whose number was exceeding great, and in all cases 
of this nature must be so, they would have been in the worst condition of 
any people in the city. 

These things agitated the minds of the common people for many months, 
while the first apprehensions were upon them, and while the plague was not, 
as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also not forgpt that the more serious 
part of the inhabitants behaved after another manner. The Government en- 
couraged their devotion, and appointed public prayers and days of fasting 
and humiliation, to make public confession of sin and implore the mercy oi 
God to avert the dreadful judgment which hung over their heads; and it ^ 
not to be expressed with what alacrity the people of all persuasions embraced 
the occasion; how they flocked to the churches and meetings, and they were 
all so thronged that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very dooi^ 
of the largest churches. Also there were daily prayers appointed morning 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 379 

evening at several churches, and days of private praying at other places; at 
all which the people attended, I say, with an uncommon devotion. Several 
private families also, as well of one opinion as of another, kept famDy fasts, 
to which they admitted their near relations only. So that, in a word, those 
people who were really serious and religious applied themselves in a truly 
Christian manner to the proper work of repentance and humiliation, as a 
Christian people ought to do. 

Again, the public showed that they would bear their share in these things; 
the very Court, which was then gay and luxurious, put on a face of just 
concern for the public danger. All the plays and interludes which, after the 
manner of the French Court, had been set up, and began to increase among 
us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, public dancing-rooms, and music- 
houses, which multiplied and began to debauch the manners of the people, 
were shut up and suppressed, and the )ack-puddings, merry-andrews, puppet- 
shows, rope-dancers, and suchlike doings, which had bewitched the poor com- 
mon people, shut up their shops, finding indeed no trade; for the minds of 
the people were agitated with other things, and a kind of sadness and horror 
at these things sat upon the countenances even of the common people. Death 
was before their eyes, and everybody began to think of their graves, not of 
i mirth and diversions. 

But even those wholesome reflections, which, rightly managed, would have 
most happily led the people to fall upon their knees, make confession of their 
sms, and look up to their merciful Saviour for pardon, imploring His com- 
passion on them in such a time of their distress, by which we might have 
been as a second Nineveh, had a quite contrary extreme in the common people, 
who, ignorant and stupid in their reflections, as they were brutishly wicked 
and thoughtless before, were now led by their fright to extremes of folly; 
and, as I have said before that they ran to conjurers and witches, and all sorts 
of deceivers, to know what should become of them (who fed their fears, and 
kept them always alarmed and awake on purpose to delude them and pick 
their pockets), so they were as mad upon their running after quacks and 
mountebanks, and every practising old woman, for medicines and remedies; 
storing themselves with such multitudes of pills, potions, and preservatives, as 
they were called, that they not only spent their money, but even poisoned 
themselves beforehand, for fear of the poison of the infection, and prepared 
their bodies for the plague, instead of preserving them against it. On me other 
hand, it is incredible, and scarce to be imagined, how the posts of houses 
and corners of streets were plastered over with doctors’ bills and papers of 
ignorant fellows, quacking and tampering in physic, and inviting the people 
to come to them for remedies, which was generally set off with such flourishes 
as these, viz.: “Infallible preventive pills against the plague.” “Never-failing 
preservatives against the infection.” “Sovereign cordials against the corruption 
of the air.” “Exact regulations for the conduct of the body in case of an 
infection.” “Anti-pestilential pills.” “Incomparable drink against the plague, 
|never found out before.” “An universal remedy for the plarae.” “The only 
plague water.” “The royal antidote against all kinds of infection;” and

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

such a number more that I cannot reckon up; and if I could, would fill a 
book of themselves to set them down. 

Others set up bills to summon people to their lodgings for directions and 
advice in the case of infection. These had specious titles also, such as these:- 

“An eminent High Dutch physician, newly come over from Holland, where he 
resided during all the time of the great plague last year in Amsterdam, and 
cured multitudes of people that actually had the plague upon them.” 

“An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, having a choice secret to pre- 
vent infection, which she found out by her great experience, and did wonderful 
cures with it in the late plague there, wherein there died 20,000 in one day.” 

“An ancient gentlewoman, having practised with great success in the late plague in 
this city, anno 1636, gives her advice only to the female sex. To be spoke 
with,” &c. 

“An experienced physician, who has long studied the doctrine of antidotes against 
all sorts of poison and infection, has, after forty years* practice, arrived to such 
skill as may, with God’s blessing, direct persons how to prevent their being 
touched by any contagious distemper whatsoever. He directs the poor gratis. 

I take notice of these by way of specimen. I could give you two or three 
dozen of the like and yet have abundance left behind. ’Tis sufficient from 
these to apprise any one of the humour of those times, and how a set of 
thieves and pickpockets not only robbed and cheated the poor people of their 
money, but poisoned their bodies with odious and fatal preparations; some 
with mercury, and some with other things as bad, perfectly remote from the 
thing pretended to, and rather hurtful than serviceable to the body in case 
an infection followed. 

I cannot omit a subtilty of one of those quack operators, with which he 
gulled the poor people to crowd about him, but did nothing for them without 
money. He had, it seems, added to his bills, which he gave about the streets, 
this advertisement in capital letters, viz., “He gives advice to the poor for 
nothing.” 

Abundance of poor people came to him accordingly, to whom he made 
a great many fine speeches, examined them of the state of their health and 
of the constitution of their bodies, and told them many good things for 
them to do, which were of no great moment. But the issue and conclusion of 
all was, that he had a preparation which if they took such a quantity of 
every morning, he would pawn his life they should never have the plague; 
no, though they lived in the house with people that were infected. This made 
the people all resolve to have it; but then the price of that was so much, I 
think ’t was half-a-crown. “But, sir,” says one poor woman, “I am a poor 
alms-woman, and am kept by the parish, and your bills say you give the poor 
your help for nothing.” “Ay, good woman,” says the doctor, “so I do, as 1 
published there. 1 give my advice to the poor for nothing, but not my physic. 
“Aks, sir!” says she, “that is a snare laid for the poor, then; for you give them 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 381 

your advice for nothing; that is to say, you advise them gratis, to buy your 
physic for their money; so does every shopkeeper with his wares.” Here the 
woman began to give him ill words, and stood at his door all that day, telling 
her tale to all the people that came, till the doctor finding she turned away 
his customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again, and give her his box 
of physic for nothing, which perhaps, too, was good for nothing when she 
had it. 

But to return to the people, whose confusions fitted them to be imposed 
upon by all sorts of pretenders and by every mountebank. There is no doubt 
but these quacking sort of fcllo^vs raised great gains out of the miserable 
people, for we daily found the crowds that ran after them 's^ere infinitely 
greater, and their doors were more thronged than those of Dr. Brooks, Dr. 
Upton, Dr. Hodges, Dr. Berwick, or any, though the most famous men of 
the time. And I was told that some of them got five pounds a day by their 
physic. 

But there was still another madness beyond all this, u hich may serve to give 
an idea of the distracted humour of the poor people at that lime, and this was 
their following a worse sort of deceivers than any of these, for these petty 
thieves only deluded them to pick their pockets and get their money, in which 
their wickedness, wliarevcr ii was, lay chiefly on the side of the deceivers de- 
ceiving, not upon the deceived. But in this part I am going to mention it lay 
chiefly in the people deceived, or equally in both, and this was in wearing 
charms, philtres, exorcisms, amulets, and I know not what preparations, to 
fortify the body with them against the plague; as if the plague was not the hand 
of God, but a kind of a possession of an evil spirit, and that it was to be kept 
off w ith crossings, signs of the zodiac, papers tied up w ith so many knots, and 
certain words or figures written on them, as particularly the word Abraca- 
dabra, formed in triangle or pyramid, thus.—

1 might spend a great deal of time in my exclamations against the follies, and 
: indeed the wickedness, of those things, in a time of such danger, in a matter 
of such consequences as this, of a national infection. But my memorandums of

that it was so. How the poor people found the insufficiency of those things, 
and how many of them were afterwards carried away in the dead-carts and

thrown into the common graves of every parish with these hellish charms and 
trumpery hanging about their necks, remains to be spoken of as we go along, 

All this was the effect of the hurry the people were in, after the first notion 
of the plague being at hand was among them, and which may be said to be 
from about Michaelmas 1664, but more particularly after the two men died 
in St. Giles’s, in the beginning of December; and again, after another alarm in 
February. For when the plague evidently spread itself, they soon began to see 
the folly of trusting to those unperforming creatures who had gulled them of 
their money; and then their fears worked another way, namely, to amazement 
and stupidity, not knowing what course to take or what to do either to help 
or relieve themselves. But they ran about from one neighbour’s house to an- 
other, and even in the streets, from one door to another, with repeated cries 
of, “Lord, have mercy upon us! What shall we do?” 

Indeed, the poor people were to be pitied in one particular thing, in which 
they had little or no relief, and which I desire to mention with a serious awe 
and reflection, which perhaps every one that reads this may not relish, namely, 
that whereas death now began not, as we may say, to hover over every one’s 
head only, but to look into their houses and chambers, and stare in their faces. 
Though there might be some stupidity and dulncss of the mind, and there was 
so, a great deal, yet there was a great deal of just alarm sounded into the very 
inmost soul, if 1 may so say, of others. Many consciences were awakened; many 
hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confession was made of crimes 
long concealed. It would wound the soul of any Christian to have heard the 
dying groans of many a despairing creature, and none durst come near to com- 
fort them. Many a robbery, many a murder, was then confessed aloud, and 
nobody surviving to record the accounts of it. People might be heard, even 
into the streets as we passed along, calling upon God for mercy, through Jesus 
Christ, and saying, “I have been a thief,” “I have been an adulterer,” “I have 
been a murderer,” and the like, and none durst stop to make the least inquiry 
into such things or to administer comfort to the poor creatures, that in the 
anguish both of soul and body thus cried out. Some of the ministers did visit 
the sick at first and for a little while, but it was not to be done. It would have 
been present death to have gone into some houses. The very buriers of the 
dead, who were the hardenedest creatures in town, were sometimes beaten back 
and so terrified that they durst not go into houses where the whole families 
were swept away together, and where the circumstances were more particu- 
larly horrible, as some were; but this was, indeed, at the first heat of the dis- 
temper. 

Time inured them to it all, and they ventured everywhere afterwards with- 
out hesitation, as I shall have occasion to mention at large hereafter. 

I am supposing now the plague to be begun, as I have said, and that the 
magistrates began to take the condition of the people into their serious consid- 
eration. What they did as to the regulation of the inhabitants and of infected 
families I shall speak to by itself; but as to the affair of health, it is proper to 
mention it here, that, having seen the foolish humour of the people in running 
after quacks and mountebanks, wizards and fortune-tellers, which they did as 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 383 

above, even to madness, the Lord Mayor, a very sober and religious gendeman^ 
appointed physicians and surgeons for relief of the poor-I mean the diseased 
poor-and in particular ordered the College of Physicians to publish directions 
for cheap remedies for the poor, in all the circumstances of the distemper. 
This, indeed, was one of the most charitable and judicious things that could be 
done at that time, for this drove the people from haunting the doors of every 
disperser of bills, and from taking down blindly, and without consideration 
poison for physic and death instead of life. 

This direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of the whole 
College, and as it was particularly calculated for the use of the poor and for 
cheap medicines, it was made public, so that everybody might see it, and copies 
were given gratis to all that desired it. But as it is public, and to be seen on all 
occasions, 1 need not give the reader of this the trouble of it. 

I shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of the physicians 
when I say that the violence of the distemper, when it came to its extren)ity, 
was like the fire the next year. The fire, which Consumed what the plague 
could not touch, defied all the application of remedies; the fire-engines were 
broken, the buckets thrown away, and the power of man was baffled and 
brought to an end. So the plague defied all medicines; the very physicians were 
seized with it, with their preservatives in their mouths; and men went about 
prescribing to others and telling them what to do, till the tokens were upon 
them, and they dropped down dead, destroyed by that very enemy they di- 
rected others to oppose. This was the case of several physicians, even some of 
them the most eminent, and of several of the most skilful surgeons. Abundance 
of quacks too died, who had the folly to trust to their own medicines, which 
they must needs be conscious to themselves were good for nothing, and who 
rather ought, like other sorts of thieves, to have run away, sensible of their 
guilt, from the justice that they could not but expect should punish them as 
they knew they had deserved. 

Not that it is any derogation from the labour or application of the physi- 
cians to say they fell in the common calamity; nor is it so intended by me; it 
rather is to their praise that they ventured their lives so far as even to lose 
them in the service of mankind. They endeavoured to do good, and to save 
the lives of others. But we were not to expect that the physicians could stop 
God’s judgments, or prevent a distemper eminently armed from heaven from 
executing the errand it was sent about. 

Doubtless, the physicians assisted many by their skill, and by their prudence 
and applications, to the saving of their lives and restoring their health. But it 
is not lessening their character or their skill, to say they could not cure those 
that had the tokens upon them, or those who were mortally infected before 
the physicians were sent for, as was frequently the case. 

It remains to mention now w^hat public measures were taken by the magis- 
trates for the general safety, and to prevent the spreading of the distemper, 
when it first broke out. I shall have frequent occasion to speak of the prudence 
of the magistrates, their charity, their vigilance for the poor, and for prese^- 
ing good order, furnishing provisions, and the like, when the plague was in-

creased, as it afterwards was. But I am now upon the order and regulations 
they published for the government of infected families. 

I mentioned above shutting of houses up; and it is needful to say something 
particularly to that, for this part of the history of the plague is very melan- 
choly, but the most grievous story must be told. 

About June the Lord Mayor of London and the Court of Aldermen, as 1 
have said, began more particularly to concern themselves for the regulation 
of the city. 

The Justices of Peace for Middlesex, by direction of the Secretary of 
State, had begun to shut up houses in the parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Ficlds. 
St. Martin, St. Clement Danes, &c., and it was with good success; for in several 
streets where the plague broke out, upon strict guarding the houses that were 
infected, and taking care to bury those that died immediately after they were 
known to be dead, the plague ceased in those streets. It was also observed that 
the plague decreased sooner in those parishes after they had been visited to the 
full than it did in the parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, White- 
chapel, Stepney, and others, the early care taken in that manner being a great 
means to the putting a check to it. 

This shutting up of houses w^as a method first taken, as I understand, in the 
plague which happened in 1603, at the coming of King James the First to the 
crown; and the power of shutting people up in their own houses ^vas granted 
by Act of Parliament, entitled, “An Act for the charitable Relief and Ordering 
of Persons infected with the Plague;” on which Act of Parliament the Lord 
Mayor and aldermen of the city of London founded the order they made at 
this time, and which took place the ist of July 1665, when the numbers in- 
fected within the city were but few, the last bill for the ninety-two parishes 
being but four; and some houses having been shut up in the city, and some 
people being removed to the pest-house beyond Bunliill Fields, in the way to 
Islington,— I say, by these means, when there died near one thousand a week 
in the whole, the number in the city was but twenty-eight, and the city was 
preserved more healthy in proportion than any other place all the time of the 
infection. 

These orders of my Lord Mayor’s were published, as I have said, the latter 
end of June, and took place from the ist of July, and were as follows, vi^.:'- 

Orders Conceived and Published by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the Ciiy of 
I vONDoN Concerning the Infecfion of the Plague, 1665. 

“Whereas in the reign of our late sovereign King James, of happy memory, an Act 
was made for the charitable relief and ordering of persons iiifccred with the plague, 
whereby authority was given to justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head- 
officers to appoint within their several limits examiners, searchers, watchmen, keep- 
ers, and buriers for the persons and places infected, and to minister unto them oaths 
for the performance of their offices. And the same statute did also authorise the 
giving or other directions, as unto them for the present necessity should seem good io 
their discretions. It is now, upon special consideration, thought very expedient for 
preventing and avoiding of infection of sickness (if it shall so please Almighty God) 
that these officers following be appointed, and these orders hereafter duly observed.

Excvfmncrs to be appointed in every Parish. 

“pint, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every parish there be one, two, 
or more persons of good sort and credit chosen and appointed by the alderman, his 
deputy, and common council of every ward, by the name of examiners, to continue 
in that office the space of two months at least. And if any fit person so appointed 
shall refuse to undertake the same, the said parties so refusing to be committed to 
prison until they shall conform themselves accordingly. 

The Examiners'* Office. 

“That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn from time to 
time what houses in every parish be visited, and what persons be sick, and of what 
diseases, as near as they can inform themselves; and upon doubt in that case, to com- 
mand restraint of access until it appear what the disease shall prove. And if they find 
any person sick of the infection, to give order to the constable that the house be 
i.hut up; and if the constable shall be found remiss or negligent, to give present notice 
thereof to the alderman of the ward. 

Watchmen. 

“That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen, one for every 
day, and the other for the night; and that these watchmen have a special care that no 
person go in or out of such infected houses whereof they have the charge, upon pain 
of severe punishment. And the said watchmen to do such further offices as the sick 
house shall need and require; and if the watchman be sent upon any business, to lock 
up the house and take the key with him; and the watchman by day to attend until 
ten of the clock at night, and the watchman by night until six in the morning. 

Searchers. 

“That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every parish, such as 
are of honest reputation, and of the best sort as can be got in this kind; and these to 
he sworn to make due search and true report to the utmost of their knowledge 
whether the persons whose bodies they are appointed to search do die of the in- 
fection, or of what other diseases, as near as they can. And that the physicians who 
shall be appointed for cure and prevention of the infection do call before them the 
said searchers who are, or shall be, appointed for the several parishes under their 
respective cares, to the end they may consider whether they are fitly qualified for 
that employment, and charge them from time to time as they shall see cause, if 
they appear defective in their duties. 

‘That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to use any public 
work or employment, or keep any shop or stall, or be employed as a laundress, or 

any other common employment whatsoever. 

Chirurgeons. 

“For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as there hath been heretofore 
great abuse in misreporting the disease, to the further spreading of the infection, it 
« therefore ordered that there be chosen and appointed able and discreet chirur- 
geons, besides those that do already belong to the pest-house, amongst whom the 
city and Liberties to be quartered as the places lie most apt and convenient; and 
every of these to have one quarter for his limit; and the said chirurgeons in every 



386 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

of their limits to join with the searchers for the view of the body, to the end 
there may be a true report made of the disease. 

“And further, that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search such-like persons 
as shall cither send for them or be named and directed unto them by the examiners 
of every parish, and inform themselves of the disease of the said parties. 

“And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from all other 
cures, and kept only to this disease of the infection, it is ordered that every of the 
said chirurgeons shall have twelvepence a body searched by them, to be paid out 
of the goods of the party searched, if he be able, or otherwise by the parish. 

Nurse-keepers. ' 

“If any nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any infected house 'before 
twenty-eight days after the decease of any person dying of the infection, the house 
to which the said nurse-keeper doth so remove herself shall be shut up until the 
said twenty-eight days be expired.” 


Orders Concerning Infected Houses and 
Persons Sick of the Plague. 

Notice to be given of the Sickness. 

“The master of every house, as soon as any one in his house complaineth, either 
of blotch or purple, or swelling m any part of his body, or fallcth otherwise danger- 
ously sick, without apparent cause of some other disease, shall give knowledge thereof 
to tne examiner of health within two hours after the said sign shall appear. 

Sequestration of the Sick. 

“As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner, chirurgeon, or searcher to 
be sick of the plague, he shall the same night be sequestered in the same house; and 
in case he be so sequestered, then, though he afterwards die not, the house wherein 
he sickened should be shut up for a month, after the use of the due preservatives 
taken by the rest. 


Airing the Stuff. 

“For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection, their bedding and ap- 
parel and hangings of chambers must be well aired with fire and such perfumes as 
are requisite within the infected house before they be taken again to use. This to 
be done by the appointment of the examiner. 

Shutting up of the House. 

“If any person shall have visited any man known tou be dnfected of the plague,

wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up for certain days by the examiner’s direc- 
tion. 


None to be removed^ out of infected Housesy buty &c. 

“Item, that none be removed out of the house where he falleth sick of the 
infection into any other house in the city (except it be to the pest-house or a

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


Every visited House to be watched. 

“That the constables see every house shut up, and to be attended with watchmen, 
which may keep them in, and minister necessaries unto them at their own charges] 
if they be able, or at the common charge, if they be unable; the shutting up to be for 
the space of four weeks after all be whole. 

“That precise order be taken that the searchers, chirurgeons, keepers, and buriers 
are not to pass the streets without holding a red rod or wand of three feet in length 
in their hands, open and evident to be seen, and are not to go into any other house 
than into their own, or into that whereunto they are directed or sent for; but to 
forbear and abstain from company, especially when they have been lately used m 
any such business or attendance. 


Inmates. 

“That where several inmates are in one and the same house, and any person in that 
house happens to be infected, no other person or family of such house shall be

health of that parish; or in default thereof, the house whither he or they so remove 
shall be shut up as in case of visitation. 

Hackney-coaches. 

“That care be taken of hackney-coachmen, that they may not (as some of them 
have been observed to do after carrying of infected persons to the pest-house and

“That no hogs, dogs, or cats, or tame pigeons, or conies, be suffered to be kept 
vi^ithin any part of the city, or any swine to be or stray in the streets or lanes, but 
that such swine be impounded by the beadle or any otlier officer, and the owner 
punished according to Act of Common Council, and that the dogs be killed by the 
dog-killers appointed for that purpose ” 

Orders Concerning Loose Persons and Idle Assemblies. 

Beggars. 

“Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of rogues and 
wandering beggars that swarm in cvciy place about the city, being a great cause of 
the spreading of the infection, and will not be avoided, notwithstanding any orders 
tliat have been given to the contrary: It is therefore now ordered, that such con- 
stables, and others whom this matter may any way concern, take special care that 
no wandering beggars be suffered in the streets of this city in any fashion or manner

upon them.

the plague. And that no company or person be suffered to remain or come into any 
tavern, ale-house, or coffee-house to drink after nine of the clock in the evening, 
according to the ancient law and custom of tliis city, upon the penalties ordained m 
that behalf. 

“And for the better execution of these orders, and such other rules and directions 
as, upon further consideration, shall be found needful: It is ordered and enjoined 
that the aldenncn, deputies, and common councilmen shall meet together weekly, 
once, twice, thrice or oftencr (as cause shall require), at some one general place 
accustomed in their respective wards (being clear from infection of the plague), to 
consult how the said orders may be duly put in execution; not intending that any 
dwelling in or near places infected shall come to the said meeting while their coming 
niay be doubtful. And the said aldcnnen, and deputies, and common councilmen in 
their several wards may put in execution any other good orders that by them at 
their said meetings shall be conceived and devised for preservation of his Majesty*s 
subjects from the infection.

I need not say that these orders extended only to such places as were withir 
the Lord Mayor’s jurisdiction, so it is requisite to observe that the Justicej 
of Peace within those parishes and places as were called the Hamlets and out 

E arts took the same method. As I remember, the orders for shutting up oj 
ouses did not take place so soon on our side, because, as I said before, the 
plague did not reach to these eastern parts of the town at least, nor begin tc 
be very violent, till the beginning of August. For example, the whole bill frotr 
the nth to the i8th of July was 1761, yet there died but 71 of the plague it 
all those parishes we call the Tower Hamlets, and they were as follows.—

This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and unchristian 
method, and the poor people so confined made bitter lamentations. Complainri 
of the severity of it were also daily brought to my Lord Mayor, of houses 
causelessly (and some maliciously) shut up. I cannot say, but upon inquiry 
many that complained so loudly were found in a condition to be continued, 
and others again, inspection being made upon the sick person, and the sickness 
not appearing infectious, or if uncertain, yet on his being content to be carried 
to the pest-house, were released. 

It is true that the locking up the doors of people’s houses, and setting a 
watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring out or any coming 
to them, when perhaps the sound people in the family inight have escaped ii 
they had been removed from the sick, looked very Tiard and cruel; and many 
people perished in these miserable confinements which, ’t is reasonable tc 
believe, would not have been distempered if they had had liberty, though th( 
plague was in the house; at which the people were very clamorous and uneasy 
at first, and several violences were committed and injuries offered to the mcr 
who were set to watch the houses so shut up; also several people broke oui 
by force in many places, as 1 shall observe by-and-by. But it was a public gooc 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 391 

that justified the private mischief, and there was no obtaining the least miti- 
gation by any application' to magistrates or government at that time, at least 
not that I heard of. This put the people upon all manner of stratagem in order, 
if possible, to get out; and it would fill a little volume to set down the arts used 
by the people of such houses to shut the eyes of the watchmen who were 
employed, to deceive them, and to escape or break out from them, in which 
frequent scuffles and some mischief happened; of which by itself. 

As I went along Houndsditch one morning about eight o’clock there was 
a great noise. It is true, indeed, there was not much crowd, because people 
were not very free to gather together, or to stay long together when they 
were there, nor did I stay long there. But the outcry was loud enough to 
prompt my curiosity, and I called to one that looked out of a window, and 
asked what was the matter. 

A watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep his post at the door 
of a house which was infected, or said to be infected, and was shut up. He 
had been there all night for two nights together, as he told his story, and 
the day-watchman had been there one day, and was now come to relieve 
him. All this while no noise had been heard in the house, no light had been 
seen, they called for nothing, sent him of no errands, which used to be the 
chief business of the watchmen; neither had they given him any disturb- 
ance, as he said, from the Monday afternoon, when he heard great crying and 
screaming in the house, which, as he supposed, was occasioned by some of the 
family dying just at that time. It seems, the night before, thp dead-cart, as it 
vas called, had been stopped there, and a servant-maid had been brought down 
to the door dead, and the buriers or bearers, as they were called, put her into 
the cart, wrapt only in a green rug, and carried her away. 

The watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, when he heard that noise 
and crying, as above, and nobody answered a great while; but at last one 
looked out and said with an angry, quick tone, and yet a kind of crying voice, 
or a voice of one that was crying, “What d’ye want, that ye make such a 
knocking^” He answered, “I am the watchman’ How do you do? What is the 
matter^” The person answered, “What is that to you^ Stop the dead- cart.” 
This, it seems, was about one o’clock. Soon after, as the fellow said, he stopped 
the dead-cart, and then knocked again, but nobody answered. He continued 
knocking, and the bellman called out several times, “Bring out your dead;” but 
nobody answered, till the man that drove the cart, being called to other houses, 
would stay no longer, and drove away. 

The watchman knew not what to make of all this, so he let them alone till 
the morning-man or day-watchman, as they called him, came to relieve him. 
Giving him an account of the particulars, they knocked at the door a great 
while, but nobody answered, and they observed that the window or casement 
at which the person had looked out who had answered before continued open, 
being up two pair of stairs. 

Upon this the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, got a long ladder, and one 
of them went up to the window and looked into the room, where he saw a 
''^oman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal manner, having no clothes on

her but her shift. But though he called aloud, and putting in his lori^ staff 
knocked hard on the floor, yet nobody stirred or answered; neither could he 
hear any noise in the house. 

He came down again upon this, and acquainted his fellow, who went up 
also; and finding it just so, they resolved to acquaint either the Lord Mayor 
or some other magistrate of it, but did not offer to go in at the window. The 
magistrate, it seems, upon the information of the two men, ordered the house 
to be broke open, a constable and other persons being appointed to be pres- 
ent, that nothing might be plundered; and accordingly it was so done, when 
nobody was found in the house but that young woman, who having been in- 
fected and past recovery, the rest had left her to die by herself, and were 
every one gone, having found some way to delude the watchman, and to get 
open the door, or get out at some back-door, or over the tops of the itouscs, 
so that he knew nothing of it; and as to those cries and shrieks which he heard, 
it was supposed they were the passionate cries of the family at the bitter part- 
ing, which, to be sure, it was to them all, this being the sister to the mistress 
of the family. The man of the house, his wife, several children, and servants, 
being all gone and fled, whether sick or sound, that I could never learn; nor, 
indeed, did I make much inquiry after it. 

Many such escapes were made out of infected houses, as particularly when 
the watchman was sent of some errand; for it was his business to go of any 
errand that the family sent him of; that is to say, for necessaries, such as food 
and physic; to fetch physicians, if they would come, or wsurgeons, or nurses, 
or to order the dead-cart, and the like; but with this condition, too, that when 
he went he was to lock up the outer door of the house and take the key away 
with him. To evade this, and cheat the watchmen, people got two or three 
keys made to their locks, or they found ways to unscrew the locks such as 
were screwed on, and so take off the lock, being in the inside of the house, and 
while they sent away the watchman to the market, to the bake-house, or for 
one trifle or another, open the door and go out as often as they pleased. But 
this being found out, the officers afterwards had orders to padlock up the doors 
on the outside, and place bolts on them as they thought fit. 

At another house, as I was informed, in the street next wuthin Aldgatc, a 
whole family was shut up and locked in because the maid-servant was taken 
sick. The master of the house had complained by his friends to the next alder- 
man and to the Lord Mayor, and had consented to have the maid carried to 
the pest-house, but was refused; so the door was marked with a red cross, 
a padlock on the outside, as above, and a watchman set to keep the door, 
according to public order. 

After the master of the house found there was no remedy, but that he, his 
wife, and his children were to be locked up with this poor divStempered servant, 
he called to the watchman, and told him he must go then and fetch a nurse for 
them to attend this poor girl, for that it would be certain death to them all 
to oblige them to nurse her; and told him plainly that if he would not do this, 
the maid must perish either of the distemper or be starved for want of food, 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 393 

for he was resolved none of his family should go near her; and she lay in the 
garret four storey high, where she could not cry out, or call to anybody for 
help. 

The watchman consented to that, and went and fetched a nurse, as he was 
appointed, and brought her to them the same evening. During this interval the 
master of the house took his opportunity to break a large hole through his 
shop into a bulk or stall, where formerly a cobbler had sat, before or under 
his shop-window; but the tenant, as may be supposed at such a dismal time 
as that, was dead or removed, and so he had the key in his own keeping. Hav- 
ing made his way into this stall, which he could not have done if the man had 
been at the door, the noise he was obliged to make being such as would have 
alirmed the watchman, 1 say, having made his way into this stall, he sat still 
till the watchman returned with the nurse, and all the next day also. But the 
night following, having contrived to send the watchman of another trifling 
errand, which, as I take it, was to an apothecary’s for a plaistcr for the maid, 
which he was to stay for the making up, or some other such errand that might 
secure his staying some time; in that time he conveyed himself and all his 
family out of the house, and left the nurse and the watchman to bury the poor 
wench— that is, throw her into the cart— and take care of the house. 

I could give a great many such stories as these, diverting enough, which in 
the long course of that dismal year I met with— that i>, heard of— and which are 
very certain to be true, or very near the truth, that is to say, true in the gen- 
eral, for no man could at such a time learn all the particulars. There was like- 
wise violence used with the watchmen, as was reported, in abundance of 
places, and I believe that from the beginning of the visitation to the end, there 
was not less than eighteen or twenty of them killed, or so wounded as to be 
taken up for dead, which was supposed to be done by the people in the infected 
houses which were shut up, and where they attempted to come out, and 
were opposed. 

Nor, indeed, could less be expected, for here were so many prisons in the 
town as there were houses shut up; and as the people shut up or imprisoned 
*50 v^cre guilty of no crime, only shut up because miserable, it was really the 
more intolerable to them. 

It had also this difference, that every prison, as we may call it, had but one 
jailer, and as he had the whole house to guard, and that many houses were so 
situated as that they had several ways out, some more, some less, and some into 
several streets, it was impossible for one man so to guard all the passages as to 
prevent the escape of people made desperate by the fright of their circum- 
stances, by the resentment of their usage, or by the raging of the distemper 
Itself; so that they would talk to the watchman on one side of the house, while 
the family made their escape at another. 

For example, in Coleman Street there are abundance of alleys, as appears still. 
A house was shut up in that they call White’s Alley, and this house had a 
back-window, not a door, into a court, which had a passage into Bell Alley, 
A watchman was set by the constable at the door of this house, and there he 



394 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

stood, or his comrade, night and day, while the family went all away in the 
evening out at that window into the court, and left the poor fellows warding 
and watching for near a fortnight. ^ 

Not far from the same place they blew up a watchman with gunpowder 
and burned the poor fellow dreadfully; and while he made hideous cries, and 
nobody would venture to come near to help him, the whole family that 'were 
able to stir got out at the windows one storey high, two that were left sick 
calling out for help. Care was taken to give them nurses to look after them 
but the persons fled were never found, till after the plague was abated they 
returned; but as nothing could be proved, so nothing could be done to them. 

It is to be considered, too, that as these were prisons without bars and bolts, 
which our common prisons are furnished with, so the people let th^selves 
down out of their windows, even in the face of the watchman, bringing iswords 
or pistols in their hands, and threatening the poor wretch to shoot him if he ; 
stirred or called for help. 

In other cases, some had gardens, and walls or pales, between them and their 
neighbours, or yards and back-houses; and these, by friendship and entreaties, 
would get leave to get over those walls or pales, and so go out at their neigh- 
bours’ doors; or, by giving money to their servants, get them to let them 
through in the night; so that, in short, the shutting up of houses was in no 
wise to be depended upon. Neither did it answer the end at all, serving more ; 
to make the people desperate, and drive them to such extremities as that the) 
would break out at all adventures. 

And that which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the ; 
infection farther by their wandering about with the distemper upon them, | 
in their desperate circumstances, than they would otherwise have done; for 
whoever considers all the particulars in such cases must acknowledge, and we 
cannot doubt but the severity of those confinements made many people deb- 
perate, and made them run out of their houses at all hazards, and with the 
plague visibly upon them, not knowing either whither to go or what to do, 
or, indeed, what they did; and many that did so were driven to dreadful 
•exigencies and extremities, and perished in the streets or fields for mere want, 
or dropped down by the raging violence of the fever upon them. Others 
wandered into the country, and went forward any way, as their desperation 
'guided them, not knowing whither they went or would go, till faint and tired, 
and not getting any relief, the houses and villages on the road refusing to adniit 
them to lodge, whether infected or no, they have perished by the roadside, 
or gotten into bams and died there, none daring to come to them or relieve 
-diem, though perhaps not infected, for nobody would 'believe them. 

On the other hand, when the plague at first seized a family, that is to say, 
when any one body of the family had gone out and unwarily or otherwise 
catched the distemper and brought it home, it was certainly known by the 
family before iwwas known to the officers, who, as you will see by the order, 
wete appointed to examine into the circumstances of all sick persons when 
they heard of their being sick. 

In this interval between their being taken 5ick and the examiners coiningi 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 395 

the master of the house had leisure and liberty to remove himself or all his 
family, if he knew whither to go, and man)^ did so. But the great disaster was, 
that many did thus after they were really infected themselves, and so carried 
the disease into the houses of those who were so hospitable as to receive them, 
which, it must be confessed, was very cruel and ungrateful. 

And this was, in part, the reason of the general notion, or scandal rather, 
which went about of the temper of people infected, namely, that they did not 
take the least care or make any scruple of infecting others, though I cannot 
sav but there might be some truth in it too, but not so general as was reported. 
What natural reason could be given for so wicked a thing at a time when they 
rmght conclude themselves just going to appear at the bar of Divine Justice 
I know not. I am very well satisfied that it cannot be reconciled to religion 
and principle any more than it can be to generosity and humanity, but I may 
speak of that again. 

1 am speaking now of people made desperate by the apprehensions of their 
being shut up, and their breaking out by stratagem or force, either before or 
after they were shut up, whose misery was not lessened when they were out, 
but sadly increased. On the other hand, many that thus got away had retreats 
to go to and other houses, where they locked themselves up and kept hid till 
the plague was over; and many families, foreseeing the approach of the dis- 
temper, laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut 
themselves up, and that so entirely that they were neither seen or heard of till 
the infection was quite ceased, and then came abroad sound and well. 1 might 
recollect several such as these, and give you the particulars of their manage- 
ment, for, doubtless, it was the most effectual secure step that could be taken 
for such whose circumstances would not admit them to remove, or who had 
not rctieats abroad proper for the case, for, in being thus shut up, they were 
AS if they had been a hundred miles off. Nor do 1 remember that any one of 
those families miscarried. Among these several Dutch merchants were particu- 
larly remarkable, who kept their houses like little garrisons besieged, suffering 
none to go in or out or come near them, particularly one in a court in Throg- 
morton Street, whose house looked into Draper’s Garden. 

But I come back to the case of families infected, and shut up by the magis- 
trates. The misery of those families is not to be expressed; and it was generally 
in such houses that we heard the most dismal shrieks and outcries of the poor 
people, terrified and even frighted to death by the sight of the condition of 
their dearest relations, and by the terror of being imprisoned as they were. 

1 remember, and while I am writing this story I think I hear the very sound 
of it, a certain lady had an only daughter, a young maiden about nineteen years 
old, and who was possessed of a very considerable fortune. They were only 
lodgers in the house where they were. The young woman, her mother, and the 
*^aid had been abroad on some occasion, I do not remember what, for the 
house was not shut up; but about two hours after they came home the young 
lady complained she was not well; in a quarter of an hour more she vomited 
I and had a violent pain in her head. “Pray God,” says her mother, in a terrible 
I fright, “my child has not the distemper!” The pain in her head increasing, her

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

mother ordered the bed to be warmed, and resolved to put her to bed, and 
prepared to give her things to sweat, which was the ordinary remedy to be 
taken when the first apprehensions of the distemper began. 

While the bed was airing the mother undressed the young woman, and just 
p she was laid down in the bed, she, looking upon her body with a candle 
immediately discovered the fatal tokens on the inside of her thighs. Her mother 
not being able to contain herself, threw down her candle and screeched out 
in such a frightful manner that it was enough to place horror upon the stoutest 
heart in the world; nor was it one scream or one cry, but the fright having 
seized her spirits, she fainted first, then recovered, then ran all over the house, 
up the stairs and down the stairs, like one distracted, and indeed really was dis- 
tracted, and continued screeching and crying out for several hours void of all 
sense, or, at least, government of her senses, and, as I was told, neve? came 
thoroughly to herself again. As to the young maiden, she was a dead corpse 
from that moment, for the gangrene which occasions the spots had spread 
[over] her whole body, and she died in less than two hours. But still the mother 
continued crying out, not knowing anything more of her child, several hours 
after she was dead. It is so long ago that 1 am not certain, but I think the 
mother never recovered, but died in two or three weeks after. 

This was an extraordinary case, and I am therefore the more particular in it 
because I came so much to the knowledge of it; but there were innumerable 
such-like cases, and it was seldom that the weekly bill came in but there were 
two or three put in frighted; that is, that may well be called frighted to death 
But besides those who were so frighted as to die upon the spot, there wen 
great numbers frighted to other extremes, some frighted out of their senses 
some out of their memory, and some out of their understanding. But I retun 
to the shutting up of houses. 

As several people, T say, got out of their houses by stratagem after they wen 
shut up, so others got out by bribing the watchmen, and giving them mone) 
to let them go privately out in the night. I must confess I thought it at that tinn 
the most innocent corruption or bribery that any man could be guilty of, am 
therefore could not but pity the poor men, and think it was hard when thre 
of those watchmen were publicly whipped through the streets for sufferin 
people to go out of houses shut up. 

But notwithstanding that severity, money prevailed with the poor men, an 
many families found means to make sallies out, and escape that way after the 
had been shut up; but these were generally such as had some places to retii 
^ to; and though there was no easy passing the roads any whither after the i 
of August, yet there were many ways of retreat, and particularly, as I hintd 
some got tents and set them up in the fields, carrying beds or straw to lie o 
and provisions to eat, and so lived in them as hermits in a cell, for nobod 
would venture to come near them; and several stories were told of such, son 
comical, some tragical, some who lived like wandering pilgrims in the descri 
and escaped by making themselves exiles in such a manner as is scarce to 1 
credited, and who yet enjoyed more liberty than was to be expected in su( 
cases. 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 397 

I have by me a story of two brothers and their kinsman, who being single 
men, but that had stayed in the city too long to get away, and indeed not 
knowing where to go to have any retreat, nor having wherewith to travel far, 
took a course for their own preservation, which though in itself at first desper- 
ate, yet was so natural that it may be wondered that no more did so at that 
time. They were but of mean condition, and yet nor so very poor as that they 
could not furnish themselves with some little conveniences such as might serve 
to keep life and soul together, and finding the distemper increasing in a terri- 
ble manner, they resolved to shift as well as they could, and to be gone. 

One of them had been a soldier in the late wars, and before that in the Low 
Countries, and having been bred to no particular employment but his arms, 
and besides being wounded, and not able to work very hard, had for some 
rime been employed at a baker’s of sca-biscuit m Wapping. 

The brother of this man was a seaman too, but somehow or other had been 
hurt of one leg, that he could not go to sea, but had worked for his living at 
asailmaker’s m Wapping, or thcieabouts, and being a good husband, had laid 
up some money, and was the richest of the three. 

The third man was a joiner or carpenter by trade, a handy fellow, and he 
hid no wealth but his box or basket of tools, with the help of which he could 
at am time get his li\ mg, such a tunc as this excepted, wherever he went, and 
ht lived near Shadwell 

They all lived in Stepney parish, which, as I have said, being the last that 
was infected, or at least violently, they stayed there till they evidently saw the 
plague was abating at the w est part of the town, and coiiung towards the east, 
where they lived 

The story of those three men, if the reader will be content to have me give 
ir in their own persons, without taking upon me to either vouch the particulars 
or answer for any mistakes, I shall gi\e as distinctly as I can, believing the 
history will be a \ery good pattern for any^ poor man to follow, in case the 
like public desolation should happen here, and if there may be no such occa- 
sion, which God of His infinite mercy grant us, still the story may have its 
uses so many ways as that it will, I hope, never be said that the relating has 
'•cm unprofitable, 

I say all this previous to the history, having yet, for the present, much more 
to say before I quit my own part 

I went all the first part of the time freely about the streets, though not so 
freely as to run myself into apparent danger, except when they dug the great 
Ft in the churchyard of our parish of Aldgate. A terrible pit it was, and I 
eould not resist my curiosity to go and see it. As near as 1 may judge, it was 
kbout forty feet in length, and about fifteen or sixteen feet broad, and, at the 
We I first looked at it, about nine feet deep, but it was said they dug itwiear 
Venty feet deep afterwards in one part of it, till they could go no deeper for 
he water, for they had, it seems, dug several large pits before this. For though 
fhe plague was long a-coming to our parish, yet, when it did come, there was 
parish in or about London where it raged with such violence as in the two 
“^anshes of Aldgate and Whitechapel. 



398 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


I say they had dug several pits in another ground, when the distemper began 
to spread in our parish, and especially when the dead-carts began to go about, 
which was not, in our parish, till the beginning of August. Into these pits they 
had put perhaps fifty or sixty bodies each; then they made larger holes, wherein 
they buried all that the cart brought in a week, which, by the middle to the 
end of August, came to from 200 to 400 a week; and they could not well dig 
them larger, because of the order of the magistrates confining them to leave 
no bodies within six feet of the surface; and the water coming on at about 
seventeen or eighteen feet, they could not well, I say, put more in one pit. But 
now, at the beginning of September, the plague raging in a dreadful manner, 
and the number of burials in our parish increasing to more than was evei 
buried in any parish about London of no larger extent, they ordejced this 
dreadful gulf to be dug, for such it was rather than a pit. 

They had supposed this pit would have supplied them for a month or m()r( 
when they dug it, and some blamed the churchwardens for suffering such j 
frightful thing, telling them they were making preparations to bury the wholi 
parish, and the like; but time made it appear the churchwardens knew the con 
dition of the parish better than they did, for the pit being finished the 4th 0 
September, I think, they began to bury in it the 6th, and by the 20th, whici 
was just two weeks, they had thrown into it 1114 bodies, when they wen 
obliged to fill it up, the bodies being then come to lie within six feet of thi 
surface. I doubt not but there may be some ancient persons alive in the parisl 
who can justify the fact of this, and are able to show even in what place of thi 
churchyard the pit lay better than I can. The mark of it also was many year 
to be seen in the churchyard on the surface, lying in length parallel with th 
passage which goes by the west wall of the churchyard out of Houndsditcl’ 
and turns east again into Whitechapel, coming out near the Three Nuns’ Inr 

It was about the 10th of September that my curiosity led, or rather drovt 
me to go and see this pit again, when there had been near 400 people buriCi 
in it; and I was not content to see it in the day-time, as 1 had done before, fo 
then there would have been nothing to have been seen but the loose earth; fo 
all the bodies that were thrown in were immediately covered with earth b 
those they called the buriers, which at other times were called bearers; bi 
1 resolved to go in the night and see some of them thrown in. 

There was a strict order to prevent people coming to those pits, and that w: 
only to prevent infection. But after some time that order was more necessar 
for people that were infected and near their end, and delirious also, would n 
to those pits, wrapt in blankets or rugs, and throw themselves in, and, as th( 
said, bury themselves. I cannot say that the officers suffered any willingly 
lie there; but I have heard that in a great pit in Finsbury, in the parish of Cri 
plegi^e, it lying open then to the fields, for it was not then walled about, [soiri' 
came and threw themselves in, and expired there, before they threw any ear 
upon them; and that when they came to bury others, and found them thci 
they were quite dead, though not cold. 

This may serve a little to describe the dreadful condition of that day, thou] 
it is impossible to say anything that is able to give a true idea of it to the

did not see it, other than this, that it was indeed very, very, very dreadful, 
and such as no tongue can express. 

1 got admittance into the churchyard by being acquainted with the sexton 
who attended, who, though he did not refuse me at all, yet earnestly persuaded 
ine not to go, telling me very seriously, for he was a good, religious, and sen- 
sible man, that it was indeed their business and duty to venture, and to run 
all hazards, and that in it they might hope to be preserved, but that I had no 
apparent call to it but my own curiosity, which, he said, he believed I would 
not pretend was sufficient to justify my running that hazard. I told him I had 
been pressed in my mind to go, and that perhaps it might be an instructing 
sight, that might not be without its uses. “Nay,'^ says the good man, “if you 
will venture upon that score, name of God go in; for, depend upon it, ’t will 
be a sermon to you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in your life. *T 
IS a speaking sight,” says he, “and has a voice with it, and a loud one, to call 
us all to repentance;” and with that he opened the door and said, “Go, if 
) 0 u will” 

His discourse had shocked my resolution a little, and I stood wavering for 
a good while, but just at that interval I saw two links come over from the end 
of the Minories, and heard the bellman, and then appeared a dead-cart, as they 
tailed it, coming over the streets; so I could no longer resist my desire of seeing 
It, and went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive at first, in the church- 
)ard, or going into it, but the buriers and the fellow that drove the cart, or 
rather led the horse and cart, but when they came up to the pit they saw a 
man go to and again, muffled up in a brown cloak, and making motions with 
his hands under his cloak, as if he was in a great agony, and the buriers im- 
mediately gathered about him, supposing he was one of those poor delirious or 
desperate creatures that used to pretend, as I have said, to bury themselves. 
He said nothing as he walked about, but two or three times groaned very 
deeply and loud, and sighed as he would break his heart. 

When the buriers came up to him they soon found he was neither a person 
infected and desperate, as 1 have observed above, or a person distempered in 
mind, but one oppressed with a dreadful weight of grief indeed, having his 
^'ife and several of his children all in the cart that was just come in with him, 
and he followed in an agony and excess of sorrow. He mourned heartily, as it 
was easy to see, but with a kind of masculine grief that could not give itself 
^ent by tears; and calmly defying the buriers to let him alone, said he would 
only sec the bodies thrown in and go away, so they left importuning him. But 
no sooner was the cart turned round and the bodies shot into the pit promiscu- 
ously, which was a surprise to him, for he at least expected they would have 
been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was 
impracticable; I say, no sooner did he sec the sight but he cried out ajoud, 
unable to contain himself. I could not hear what he said, but he went backward 
^0 or three steps and fell down in a swoon. The buriers ran to him and took 
bim up, and in a little while he came to himself, and they led him away to the 
Tavern over against the end of Houndsditch, where, it seems, the m^ 
known, and where they took care of him. He looked into the pit again

as went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies so immediately with 
throwing in earth, that though there was light enough, for there were lanterns 
and candles in them, placed all night round the sides of the pit, upon heaps of 
earth, seven or eight, or perhaps more, yet nothing could be seen. 

This was a mournful scene indeed, and affected me almost as much as the 
rest; but the other was awful and full of terror. The cart had in it sixteen or 
seventeen bodies; some were wrapt up in linen sheets, some in rags, some little 
other than naked, or so loose that what covering they had fell from them in 
the shooting out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the rest; but the 
matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one else, seeing 
they were all dead, and were to be huddled together into the common grave 
of mankind, as we may call it, for here was no difference made, but Ijoor and 
rich went together; there was no other way of burials, neither was it possible 
there should, for coffins were not to be had for the prodigious numbers that 
fell in such a calamity as this. 

It was reported by way of scandal upon the buriers, that if any corpse was 
delivered to them decently wound up, as we called it then, in a winding-sheet 
tied over the head and feet, which some did, and which was generally of good 
linen; I say, it was reported that the buriers were so v icked as to strip them 
in the cart and carry them quite naked to the ground. But as 1 cannot easily 
credit anything so vile among Christians, and at a time so filled with terrors 
as that was, I can only relate it and leave it undetermined. 

Innumerable stories also went about of the cruel behaviours and practices 
of nurses who tended the sick, and of their hastening on the fate of those they 
tended in their sickness. But 1 shall say more of this in its place. 

I was indeed shocked with this sight; it almost overwhelmed me, and I went 
away with my heart most afflicted, and full of the afflicting thoughts, such 
as I cannot describe. Just at my going out of the church, and turning up the 
street towards my own house, I saw another cart with links, and a bellman 
going before, coming out of Harrow Alley in the Butcher Row, on the other 
side of the way, and being, as I perceived, very full of dead bodies, it went 
directly over the street also toward the church. I stood a while, but 1 had no 
stomach to go back again to sec the same dismal scene over again, so I went 
directly home, where I could not but consider with thankfulness the risk I had 
run, believing 1 had gotten no injury, as indeed 1 had not. 

Here the poor unhappy gentleman’s grief came into my head again, and 
indeed T could not but shed tears in the reflection upon it, perhaps more thai 
he did himself; but his case lay so heavy upon my mind that 1 could not prevai 
with myself, but that I must go out again into the §trect, and go to the Pf 
Tavern, resolving to inquire what became of him. 

It was by this time one o’clock in the morning, and yet the poor gentlemai 
was there. The truth was, the people of the house, knowing him, had cntei 
tained him, and kept him there all the night, notwithstanding the danger c 
being infected by him, though it appeared the man was perfectly soun 
himself. 

It is with regret that I take notice of this tavern. The people were civi

lannerly, and an obliging sort of folks enough, and had till this time kept their 
ouse open and their trade going on, though not so very publicly as formerly; 
at there was a dreadful set of fellows that used their house, and who, in the 
addle of all this horror, met there every night, behaved with all the revelling 
id roaring extravagances as is usual for such people to do at other times, and, 
idecd, to such an offensive degree that the very master and mistress of the 
ouse grew first ashamed and then terrified at them. 

They sat generally in a room next the street, and as they always kept late 
ours, so when the dead-cart came across the street-end to go into Hounds- 
itch, which was in view of the tavern windows, they would frequently open 
le windows as soon as they heard the bell and look out at them, and as they 
light often hear sad lamentations of people in the streets or at their windows 
b the carts went along, they would make their impudent mocks and jeers at 
icm, especially if they heard the poor people call upon God to have mercy 
pon them, as many would do at those tunes in their ordinary passing along 
iic streets. 

These gentlemen, being something disturbed with the clutter of bringing the 
oor gentleman into the house, as above, were first angry and very high with 
[ic master of the house for suffering such a fellow, as they called him, to be 
roiight out of the grave into their house; but being answered that the man 
^as a neighbour, and that he was sound, but overwhelmed with the calamity 
if his family, and the like, they turned their anger into ridiculing the man and 
iis sorrow for his wife and children, taunted him with want of courage to leap 
ito the great pit and go to heaven, as they jecrmgly expressed it, along with 
hem, adding some very profane and even blasphemous expressions. 

They were at this vile work when 1 came back to the house, and, as far as 
could see, though the man sat still, mute and disconsolate, and their affronts 
oiild not divert his sorrow, yet he was both grieved and offended at their 
liscoursc. Upon this I gently reproved them, being well enough acquainted 
vith* their characters, and not unknown in person to two of them. 

They immediately fell upon me with ill language and oaths, asked me what 
did out of my grave at such a time when so many honester men were carried 
nto the churchyard, and why I was not at home saying my prayers against 
he dead-cart came for me, and the like. 

I was indeed astonished at the impudence of the men, though not at all dis- 
-omposed at their treatment of me. However, 1 kept my temper. I told them 
hat though I defied them or any man in the world to tax me with any dishon- 
yet 1 acknowledged that m this terrible judgment of God many better 
han 1 were swept away and carried to their grave. But to answer their question 
lirectly, the case was, that 1 was mercifully preserved by that great God 
^hose name they had blasphemed and taken in vam by cursing and swearing 
n a dreadful manner, and that 1 believed I was preserved in particular, among 
>ther ends of His goodness, that I might reprove them for their audacious 
coldness in behaving in such a manner and in such an awful time as this was, 
'Specially for their jeering and mocking at an honest gentleman and a neigh- 
bour (for some of them knew him), who, they saw, was overwhelmed with

sorrow for the breaches which it had pleased God to make upon his family, 

I cannot call exactly to mind the hellish, abominable raillery which was the 
return they made to that talk of mine, being provoked, it seems, that 1 was 
not at all afraid to be free with them; nor, if I could remember, would I fiU 
my account with any of the words, the horrid oaths, curses, and vile expres- 
sions, such as, at that time of the day, even the worst and ordinariest people 
in the street would not use; for, except such hardened creatures as these, the 
most wicked wretches that could be found had at that time some terror upon 
their minds of the hand of that Power which could thus in a moment destroy 
them. 

But that which was the worst in all their devilish language was, tijhat they 
were not afraid to blaspheme God and talk atheistically, making a jejjt of my 
calling the plague the hand of God; mocking, and even laughing, at the word 
judgment, as if the providence of God had no concern in the inflictihg such 
a desolating stroke, and that the people calling upon God as they saw the cans 
carrying away the dead bodies was all enthusiastic, absurd, and impertinent. 

I made them some reply, such as I thought proper, but which I found was 
so far from putting a check to their horrid way of speaking that it made them 
rail the more, so that I confess it filled me with horror and a kind of rage, and 
I came away, as 1 told them, lest the hand of that Judgment which had visited 
the whole city should glorify His vengeance upon them, and all that were 
near them. 

They received all reproof with the utmost contempt, and made the greatest 
mockery that was possible for them to do at me, giving me all the opprobrious, 
insolent scoffs that they could think of for preaching to them, as they called 
it, which indeed grieved me, rather than angered me; and I went away, 
blessing God, however, in my mind that 1 had not spared them, though they 
had insulted me so much. 

They continued this wretched course three or four days after this, con- 
tinually mocking and jeering at all that showed themselves religious or serious, 
or that were any way touched with the sense of the terrible judgment of God 
upon us; and I was informed they flouted in the same manner at the good 
people who, notwithstanding the contagion, met at the church, fasted, and 
prayed to God to remove His hand from them. 

I say, they continued this dreadful course three or four days—T think it was 
no more— when one of them, particularly he who asked the poor gentleman 
what he did out of his grave, was struck from Heaven with the plague, and 
died in the most deplorable manner; and, in a word, they were every one oi 
them carried into the great pit which 1 have meatioOed above, before it waJ 
quite filled up, which was not above a fortnight or thereabout. 

These men were guilty of many extravagances, such as one would thinl 
human nature should have trembled at the thoughts of at such a time of genera 
t^iTor as was then upon us, and particularly scoffing and mocking at every 
^ing which they happened to see that was religious among die people 
especially at their thronging zealously to the place of public worship 
implore mercy from Heaven in such a time of distress; and this tavern wher

ley held their club being within view of the church-door, they had the more 
articular occasion for their atheistical profane mirth. 

But this began to abate a little with them before the accident which I have 
jlatcd happened, for the infection increased so violently at this part of the 
)wn now, that people began to be afraid to come to the church; at least such 
umbers did not resort thither as was usual. Many of the clergymen likewise 
rerc dead, and others gone into the country; for it really required a steady 
[)urage and a strong faith for a man not only to venture being in town at such 
nine as this, but likewise to venture to come to church and perform the 
ffice of a minister to a congregation, of whom he had reason to believe many 
f them were actually infected with the plague, and to do this every day, or 
vice a day, as in some places was done. 

It IS true the people showed an extraordinary zeal in these religious exer- 
ises, and as the church-doors were always open, people u ould go m single at 
1 times, whether the minister was officiating or no, and locking themselves 
ito separate pews, would be praying to God with great fervency and 
evotion. 

Others assembled at meeting-houses, every one as their different opinions in 
jch things guided, but all were promiscuously the subject of these men’s 
rollcry, especially at the beginning of the visitation. 

It seems they had been checked for their open insulting religion in this 
lanner by several good people of every persuasion, and that, and the violent 
iging of the infection, I suppose, was the occasion that they had abated much 
f their rudeness for some time before, and were only roused by the spirit of 
baldry and atheism at the clamour which was made when the gentleman was 
rst brought in there, and perhaps were agitated by the same devil, when I 
)ok upon me to reprove them; though I did it at first with all the calmness, 
sniper, and good manners that 1 could, which for a while they insulted me 
le more for, thinking it had been in fear of their resentment, though after- 
wards they found the contrary. 

1 went home, indeed, grieved and afflicted in my mind at the abominable 
itkedness of those men, not doubting, however, that they would be made 
leadful examples of God’s justice; for I looked upon this dismal time to be 
particular season of Divine vengeance, and that God would on this occasion 
ngle out the proper objects of His displeasure in a more especial and re- 
larkable manner than at another time; and that though I did believe that many 
od people would, and did, fall in the common calamity, and that it was no 
main rule to judge of the eternal state of any one by their being distinguished 
1 such a time of general destruction neither one way or other, yet, I say, it 
ould not but seem reasonable to believe that God would not think fit to spare 
y His mercy such open declared enemies, that should insult His name and 
*eing, defy His vengeance, and mock at His worship and worshippers at such 
^nie; no, not though His mercy had thought fit to bear with and spare them 
f other times; that this was a day of visitation, a day of God’s anger, and 
l^ose words came into my thought, Jer, v. 9: “Shall I not visit for these things? 
iith the Lord: and shall not My soul be avenged of such a nation as this!” 



404 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


These things, I say, lay upon my mind, and 1 went home very much grieved 
and oppressed with the horror of these men’s wickedness, and to think that 
anything could be so vile, so hardened, and so notoriously wicked as to insult 
God, and His servants, and His worship in such a manner, and at such a time 
as this was, when He had, as it were, His sword drawn in His hand on purpose 
to take vengeance, not on them only, but on the whole nation. 

I had, indeed, been in some passion at first with them, though it was really 
raised, not by any affront they had offered me personally, but by the horroj 
their blaspheming tongues filled me with. However, I was doubtful in my 
thoughts whether the resentment I retained was not all upon my own private 
account, for they had given me a great deal of ill language too—I mean 
personally; but after some pause, and having a weight of grief upon ipy mind, 
I retired myself as soon as 1 came home, for 1 slept not that night; and giving 
God most humble thanks for my preservation in the eminent dang<?r I had 
been in, 1 set my mind seriously and with the utmost earnestness to pray for 
those desperate wretches, that God would pardon them, open their eyes, and 
effectually humble them. 

By this I not only did my duty, namely, to pray for those who despitefully 
used me, but 1 fully tried my own heart, to my full satisfaction, that it was not 
filled with any spirit of resentment as they had offended me in particular; and 
I humbly recommend the method to all those that would know, or be certain, 
how to distinguish between their real zeal for the honour of God and the 
effects of their private passions and resentment. 

But I must go back here to the particular incidents which occur to my 
thoughts of the time of the visitation, and particularly to the time of theii 
shutting up houses, in the first part of their sickness; for before the sickness 
was come to its height people had more room to make their observations thao 
they had afterward; but when it was in the extremity there was no such thing 
as communication with one another, as before. 

During the shutting up of houses, as I have said, some violence was offen 
to the watchmen. As to soldiers, there were none to be found; the few guard 
which the king then had, which were nothing like the number entcrtainei 
since, were dispersed, either at Oxford with the Court, or in quarters in th 
remoter parts of the country, small detachments excepted, who did duty at th 
Tower and at Whitehall, and these but very few. Neither am I positive tb 
there was any other guard at the Tower than the warders, as they called then 
who stand at the gate with gowns and caps, the same as the yeomen of d 
guard, except the ordinary gunners, who were wenty-four, and the office 
appointed to look after the magazine, who were called armourers. As to trdnt 
bands, there was no possibility of raising any; neither, if the Lieutenancy, eith 
of London or Middlesex, had ordered the drums to beat for the militia, wou 
any of the companies, I believe, have drawn together, whatever risk they n: 
run. . j 1 

This made the watchmen be the less regarded, and perhaps occasioned t 
greater violence to be used against them. 1 mention it on this score to obser 
that the setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was, first of all, not ciic

ual, people broke out, whether by force or by stratagem, even 

jiuost as often as they pleased; and, second, tliat those that did thus break 
)Ut were generally people infected, who, in their desperation, running about 
roiTi one place to another, valued not whom they injured, and which perhaps, 
IS I have said, might give birth to report that it was natural to the infected 
jeople to desire to infect others, which report was really false. 

And I know it so well, and in so many several cases, that I could give 
leveral relations of good, pious, and religious people who, when they have had 
he distemper, have been so far from being forward to infect others that they 
lavc forbid their own family to come near them, in hopes of their being pre- 
erved, and have even died without seeing their nearest relations, lest they 
hould be instrumental to give them the distemper, and infect or endanger 
hem. If, then, there were cases wherein the infected people were careless of 
[he injury they did to others, this was certainly one of them, if not the chief, 
[lamely, when people who had the distemper had broken out from houses 
jvhich were so shut up, and having been driven to extremities for provision or 
or entertainment, had endeavoured to conceal their condition, and have been 
hereby instrumental involuntarily to infect others who have been ignorant 
'nd unwary. 

This is one of the reasons why I believed then, and do believe still, that the 
hutting up houses thus by force, and restraining, or rather imprisoning, people 
n their own houses, as I said above, was of little or no service in the whole, 
slay, 1 am of opinion it was rather hurtful, having forced those desperate 
leople to wander abroad with the plague upon them, who would otherwise 
^avc died quietly in their beds. 

I remember one citizen w^ho, having thus broken out of his house in Alders- 

| ;ate Street or thereabout, went along the road to Islington; he attempted to 
lave gone in at the Angel Inn, and after that at the White Horse, two inns 
:nown still by the same signs, but was refused; after which he came to the 
^ied Bull, an inn also still continuing the same sign. He asked them for lodging 
or one night only, pretending to be going into Lincolnshire, and assuring 
pern of his being very sound and free from the infection, which also at that 
line had not reached much that way. 

i They told him they had no lodging that they could spare but one bed up in 
be garret, and that they could spare that bed but for one night, some drovers 
'eing expected the next day with cattle; so, if he would accept of that lodgii^, 
might have it, which he did. So a servant was sent up with a candle with 
1 to show him the room. He was very well dressed, and looked like a person 
used to lie in a garret; and when he came to the room he fetched a deep 
gh, and said to the servant, “I have seldom lain in such a lodging as this.’’ 
powever, the servant assuring him again that they had no better, “Well,” says 
“I must make shift; this is a dreadful time; but it is but for one night ” So 
: sat down upon the bedside, and bade the maid, I think it was, fetch him up 
[pint of warm ale. Accordingly the servant went for the ale, but some hurry 
J die house, which perhaps employed her other ways, put it out of her head, 
she went up no more to him.

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


The next morning, seeing no appearance of the gentleman, somebody in th 
house asked the servant that had showed him upstairs what was become of hiir 
She started. “Alas!” says she, “I never thought more of him. He bade me earn 
him some warm ale, but I forgot.” Upon which, not the maid, but some othc 
person was sent up to see after him, who, coming into the room, found hiji 
stark dead and almost cold, stretched out across the bed. His clothes wer 
pulled off, his jaw fallen, his eyes open in a most frightful posture, the rug o 
the bed being grasped hard in one of his hands, so that it was plain he diei 
soon after the maid left him; and ’tis probable, had she gone up with the al( 
she had found him dead in a few minutes after he sat down upon the bed. Th 
alarm was great in the house, as any one may suppose, they having been fre 
from the distemper till that disaster, which, bringing the infection to the housi 
spread it immediately to other houses round about it. I do not remember bo^ 
many died in the house itself, but I think the maid-servant who went up fir* 
with him fell presently ill by the fright, and several others; for, whereas ther 
died but two in Islington of the plague the week before, there died seventee 
the week after, whereof fourteen were of the plague. This was in the wee 
from the iith of July to the i 8 th. 

There was one shift that some families had, and that not a few, when thel 
houses happened to be infected, and that was this: the families who, in the fir: 
breaking out of the distemper, fled away into the country and had rctrea' 
among their friends, generally found some or other of their neighbours t 
relations to commit the charge of those houses to for the safety of the 
and the like. Some houses were, indeed, entirely locked up, the doors j 
locked, the windows and doors having deal boards nailed over them, and onl 
the inspection of them committed to the ordinary watchmen and paris 
ofEcers; but these were but few. 

It was thought that there were not less than 10,000 houses forsaken of tl 
inhabitants in the city and suburbs, including what was in the out-parishes ar 
in Surrey, or the side of the water they called Southwark. This was besides tl 
numbers of lodgers, and of particular persons who were fled out of oth 
families; so that in all it was computed that about 200,000 people were fled ai 
gone. But of this 1 shall speak again. But I mention it here on this accoui 
namely, that it was a rule with those who had thus two houses in their keepr 
or care, that if anybody was taken sick in a family, before the master of t 
family let the examiners or any other officer know of it, he immediately woi 
send all the rest of his family, whether children or servants, as it fell out to 1 
to such other house which he had so in charge, and then giving notice of t 
sick person to the examiner, have a nurse or- nurses appointed, and hi 
another person to be shut up in the house with them (which many for inor 
would do), so to take charge of the house in case the person should die. 

This was, in many cases, the saving a whole family, who, if they had b( 
shut up with the sick person, would inevitably have perished. But, on 
other hand, this was another of the inconveniences of shutting up houses; 
thfc apprehensions and terror of being shut up made many run away with 
rest or the family, who, though it was not publicly known, and they were i

quite sick, had yet the distemper upon them; and who, by having an nninter-» 
nipted liberty to go about, but being obliged still to conceal their circum- 
stances, or perhaps not knowing it themselves, gave the distemper to others, 
and spread the infection in a dreadful manner, as I shall explain further 

hereafter. 

And here I may be able to make an observation or two of my own,, which 
,nay he of use hereafter to those into \vhose hands these may conie, if they 
Should ever see the like dreadful visitation, (i.) The infection generally came 
into the houses of the citizens by the means of their servants, whom they were 
obbgcd to send up and down the streets for necessaries; that is to say, for 
cod or physic, to bake-houses, brew-houses, shops, &c.; and who going 
necessarily through the streets into shops, markets, and the like, it was im- 
possible but that they should, one way or other, meet with distempered people, 

I \ho conveyed the fatal breath into them, and they brought it home to the 
amities to which they belonged. (2.) It was a great mistake that such a great 
:ity as this had but one pest-house; for had there been, instead of one pest- 
luse—viz., beyond Bunhill Fields, where, at most, they could receive, perhaps, 
0 hundred or three hundred peoplc—l say, had there, instead of that one, 
en several pest-houses, every one able to contain a thousand people, without 
mg two in a bed, or tuo beds in a room, and had every master of a family, 
soon as any servant especially had been taken sick in his house, been obliged 
send them to the next pest-house, if they were willing, as many were, and 
id the examiners done the like among the poor people when any had been 
neken with the infection; I say, had this been done where the people were 
illing (not otherwise), and the houses not been shut, I am persuaded, and 
as all the while of that opinion, that not so many, by several thousands, had 
d, for it was observed, and I could give several instances within the compass 
111) ovn knowledge, where a servant had been taken sick, and the family 
id either time to send him out or retire from the house and leave the sick 
irson, as I have said above, they had all been preserved; whereas when, upon 
1C or more sickening in a family, the house has been shut up, the whole family 
ive perished, aiqd the bearers been obliged to go in to fetch out the dead 
^dics, not being able to bring them to the door, and at last none left to do it. 
(3.) This put it out of question to me, that the calamity was spread by 
ffection, that is to say, by some certain steams or fumes, which the physicians 
>11 effluvia, by the breath, or by the sweat, or by the stench of the sores of the 
bk peisoiis, or some other way, perhaps, beyond even the reach of the 
[lysicians themselves, which effluvia affected the sound who came within 
frtam distances of the sick, immediately penetrating the vital parts of the 
pd sound persons, putting their blood into an immediate ferment, and agitat- 
1 their spirits to that degree which it was found they were agitated; and so 
3 se newly infected persons communicated it in the same manner to others. 

t d this 1 shall give some instances of, that cannot but convince those who 
lously consider it; and I cannot but with some wonder find some people, 
V the contagion is over, talk of its being an immediate stroke from Heaven, 
^thout the agency of means, having commission to strike this and that pamc-

ular person, and none other, which I look upon with contempt as the effec 
of manifest ignorance and enthusiasm; likewise the opinion of others, who tal] 
of infection being carried on by the air only, by carrying with it vas 
numbers of insects and invisible creatures, who enter into the body with thi 
breath, or even at the pores with the air, and there generate or emit most acuti 
poisons, or poisonous ovae or eggs, which mingle themselves with the blood 
and so infect the body: a discourse full of learned simplicity, and manifestej 
to be so by universal experience; but I shall say more to this case in its order 

I must here take further notice that nothing was more fatal to the inhabitant 
of this city than the supine negligence of the people themselves, who, durinj 
the long notice or warning they had of the visitation, made no provision fo 
it, by laying in store of provisions, or of other necessaries, by Which the 
might have lived retired, and within ^eir own houses, as I have observed other 
did, and who were in a great measure preserved by that caution; nor wer 
they, after they were a little hardened to it, so shy of conversing with on 
another, when actually infected, as they were at first, no, though they knew i 

I acknowledge 1 was one of those thoughtless ones that had made so littl 
provision that my servants were obliged to go out of doors to buy every trifl 
by penny and halfpenny, just as before it began, even till my experienc 
showing me the folly, I began to be wiser so late that 1 had scarce time to stoi 
myself sufficient for our common subsistence for a month. 

1 had in family only an ancient woman that managed the house, a mail 
servant, two apprentices, and m)sclf; and the plague beginning to incrcai 
about us, I had many sad thoughts about what course 1 should take, and ho 
I should act. The many dismal objects, which happened everywhere as 1 "wei 
about the streets, had filled my mind with a great deal of horror, for fean 
the distemper, which was, indeed, very horrible in itself, and in some mo 
than in others. The swellings, which w^erc generally in the neck or groin, whi 
they grew hard and would not break, grew so painful that it was equal totl 
most exquisite torture; and some, not able to bear the torment, threw thcr 
selves out at window s or shot themselves, or otherwise made themselves m 
and I saw several dismal objects of that kind. Others, unvible to contain thci 
selves, vented their pain by incessant roarings, and such loud and lamental 
cries were to be heard as w'c walked along the streets that would pierce t 
very heart to think of, especially wdicn it was to be considered that the sa: 
dreadful scourge might be expected every moment to seize upon ourselves. 

I cannot say "but that now 1 began to faint in my resolutions; my heart fai 
me very much, and sorely I repented of my rashness. When 1 had been c 
and met with such terrible things as these 1 have talked of, 1 say 1 repented 
rashness in venturing to abide in town. T wished often that I had not tal 
upon me to stay, but had gone away with my brother and his family. 

Terrified by those frightful objects, I w^ould retire home sometirnes, i 
resolve to go out no more; and perhaps I would keep those resolutions 
three or four days, which time 1 spent in the most serious thankfulness for 
preservation and the preservation of my family, and the constant confcssioi 
my sins, giving myself up to God every day, and applying to Him ^ ,

asfing, humiliation, and meditation. Such intervals as I had I employed in 
eading books and in writing down my memorandums of what occurred to me 
\ery day, and out of which, afterwards, I took most of this work, as it relates 
,0 my observations without doors. What I wrote of my private meditations I 
reserve for private use, and desire it may not be made public on any account 
Uutever. 

I also wrote other meditations upon divine subjects, such as occurred to me 
It that time and were profitable to myself, but not fit for any other view, and 
therefore I say no more of that. 

1 had a very good friend, a physician, whose name was Heath, whom I 
frequently visited during this dismal time, and to whose advice I was very 
jiiuch obliged for many things which he directed me to take, by way of 
preventing the infection when 1 went out, as he found T frequently did, and 
() hold in my mouth when I was in the streets. He also came very often to see 
nc, and as he was a good Christian as well as a good physician, his agreeable 
ponvcisation was a very great support to me in the worst of this terrible time. 
It V as now the beginning of August, and the plague grew very violent and 
triible in the place where I lived, and Dr. Heath coming to visit me, and 
inding that I ventured so often out in the streets, earnestly persuaded me to 
odv myself up and my family, and not to suffer any of us to go out of doors; 
:o keep all our windows fast, shutters and curtains close, and never to open 
hem, but first, to make a very strong smoke in the room where the window or 
ioor was to be opened, with rosin and pitch, biimstone or gunpowder, and 
he like, and we did this for some time, but as I had not laid in a store of 
)rovision for such a retreat, it was impossible that wc could keep within doors 
intirely. However, I attempted, though it was so very late, to do something 
:oA\ards it, and first, as I had convenience both for brewing and baking, I went 
nd bought two sacks of meal, and for several weeks, having an oven, we baked 
ill our own bread; also I bought malt, and brewed as much beer as all the 
asks I had would hold, and which seemed enough to serve my house for five 
>r six ceks; also I laid in a quantity of salt butter and Cheshire cheese; but 
hid no flesh-meat, and the plague raged so violently among the butchers and 
laughter-houses on the other side of our street, where they are known to 
I'' ell in great numbers, that it was not advisable so much as to go over the 
trect among them. 

And here I must observe again, that this necessity of going out of our houses 
' buy provisions was in a great measure the rum of the whole city, for the 
eople catched the distemper on these occasions one of another, and even the 
|ro\isions themselves were often tainted, at least I have great reason to believe 
. and therefore I cannot say with satisfaction what I know is repeated with 
rtdt assurance, that the market-people and such as brought provisions to 
were never infected. I am certain the butchers of Whitechapel, where 
greatest part of the flesh-meat was killed, were dreadfully visited, and that 
^ least to such a degree that few of their shops were kept open, and those that 
eniaincd of them killed their meat at Mile End and that way, and brought it 
' market upon horses. 



410 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

However, the poor people could not lay up provisions, and there was a 
necessity that they must go to market to buy, and others to send servants or 
their children; and as this was a necessity which renewed itself daily, it brought 
abundance of unsound people to the markets, and a great many that went 
thither sound brought death home with them. 

It is true people used all possible precaution. When any one bought a joint 
of meat in the market they would not take it off the butcher’s hand, but took 
it off the hooks themselves. On the other hand, the butcher would not touch 
the money, but have it put into a pot full of vinegar, which he kept for that 
purpose. The buyer carried always small money to make up any odd sum^ that 
they might take no change. They carried bottles of scents and perfumes in their 
hands, and all the means that could be used were used; but then the poor cpuld 
not do even these things, and they went at all hazards. ' 

Innumerable dismal stories we heard every day on this very account. Some- 
times a man or woman dropped down dead in the very markets, for many 
people that had the plague upon them knew nothing of it till the inward 
gangrene had affected tneir vitals, and they died in a few moments. This 
caused that many died frequently in that manner in the streets suddenly, with- 
out any warning; others perhaps had time to go to the next bulk or stall, or to 
any door-porch, and just sit down and die, as I have said before. 

These objects were so frequent in the streets that when the plague came to 
be very raging on one side, there was scarce any passing by the streets but 
that several dead bodies would be lying here and there upon the ground. On 
the other hand, it is observable, that though at first the people would stop as 
they went along and call to the neighbours to come out on such an occasion, 
yet afterward no notice was taken of them; but that, if at any time we found 
a corpse lying, go across the way and not come near it; or, if in a narrow lane 
or passage, go back again and seek some other way to go on the business we 
were upon; and in those cases the corpse was always left till the officers had 
notice to come and take them away, or till night, when the bearers attending 
the dead-cart would take them up and carry them away. Nor did those 
undaunted creatures who performed these offices fail to search their pockets, 
and sometimes strip off their clothes if they were well dressed, as sometimes 
they were, and carry off what they could get. 

But to return to the markets. The butchers took that care that if any person 
died in the market they had the ofiicers always at hand to take them up upon 
hand-barrows and carry them to the next churchyard; and this was so fre- 
quent that such were not entered in the weekly bill, “Found dead in the 
streets or fields,” as is the case now, but they went into ^ the general articles 
of the great distemper. 

But now the fury of the distemper increased to such a degree that even the 
markets were but very thinly furnished with provisions or frequented with 
buyers compared to what they were before; and the Lord Mayor caused the 
country people who brought provisions to be stopped in the streets leading into 
the town, and to sit down there with their goods, where they sold what they 
brought, and went immediately away; and this encouraged the country people 



A JOURNAL OF THE FLAGUE YEAR 41l 

gready to do so, for they sold their provisions at the very entrances inito die 
the town, and even in the fields, as particularly in the fields beyond White- 
chapel, in Spitalfields;^ also in St. George’s Fields in Southwark, in Bunhill 
Fields, and in a great field called Wood’s Close, near Islington. Thither the 
Lord Mayor, aldermen, and magistrates sent their officers and servants to buy 
for their families, themselves keeping within doors as much as possible, and 
the like did many other people; and after this method was taken the country 
people came with great cheerfulness, and brought provisions of all sorts, and 
very seldom got any harm, which, 1 suppose, added also to that report of their 
being miraculously preserved. 

As for my little family, having thus, as I have said, laid in a store of bread, 
butter, cheese, and beer, I took my friend and physician’s advice, and locked 
myself up, and my family, and resolved to suffer the hardship of living a few 
months without flesh-meat, rather than to purchase it at the hazard of our lives. 

But though I confined my family, 1 could not prevail upon my unsatisfied 
curiosity to stay within entirely myself; and though 1 generally came frighted 
and terrified home, yet 1 could not restrain; only that indeed I did not do it so 
frequently as at first. 

1 had some little obligations, indeed, upon me to go to my brother’s house, 
which was in Coleman Street parish, and which he had left to my care, and 
I went at first every day, but afterwards only once or twice a week. 

In these walks I had many dismal scenes before my eyes, as particularly of 
persons falling dead in the streets, terrible shrieks and screechings of women, 
who, in their agonies, would throw open their chamber windows and cry out 
in a dismal, surprising manner. It is impossible to describe the variety of 
postures in which the passions of the poor people would express themselves. 

Passing through Tokenhouse Yard, in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement 
violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful 
screeches, and then cried, “Oh! death, death, death!” in a most inimitable tone, 
and which struck me with horror and a chillness in my very blood. There was 
nobody to be seen in the whole street, neither did any other window open, for 
people had no curiosity now in any case, nor could anybody help one another, 
so I went on to pass into Bell Alley. 

Just in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the passage, there was a more terrible 
cry than that, though it was not so directed out at the window; but the whole 
family was in a terrible fright, and I could hear women and children run 
screaming about the rooms like distracted, when a garret-window opened, 
and somebody from a window on the other side the alley called and asked, 
“What is the matter?” upon which, from the first window it was answered, 
“O Lord, my old master has hanged himself!” The other asked again, “Is he 
quite dead?” and the first answered, “Ay, ay, quite dead; quite dead and cold!” 
This person was a merchant and a deputy alderman, and very rich. I care not 
to mention the name, though I knew his name too, but that would be an hard- 
ship to the family, which is now flourishing again. 

^Thosc streets now called Spitalfields were then indeed open fields. [1754 edition.]

But this is but one; it is scarce credible what dreadful cases happened in 
particular families every day. People in the rage of the distemper, or in the 
torment of their swellings, which was indeed intolerable, running out of their 
own government, raving and distracted, and oftentimes laying violent hands 
upon themselves, throwing themselves out at their windows, shooting them- 
selves, &c.; mothers murdering their own children in their lunacy, some dying 
of mere grief as a passion, some of mere fright and surprise without any 
infection at all, others frighted into idiotism and foolish distractions, some into 
despair and lunacy, others into melancholy madness. 

The pain of the swelling was in particular very violent, and to spme 
intolerable; the physicians and surgeons may be said to have tortured many 
poor creatures even to death. The swellings in some grew hard, and they 
applied violent drawing-plaistcrs or poultices to break them, and if these did 
not do they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner. In some those swellings 
were made hard partly by the force of the distemper and partly by their 
being too violently drawn, and were so hard that no instrument could cut 
them, and then they burnt them with caustics, so that many died raving mad 
with the torment, and some in the very operation. In these distresses, some, for 
want of help to hold them down in their beds, or to look to them, laid hands 
upon themselves, as above. Some broke out into the streets, perhaps naked, and 
would run directly down to the river, if they were not stopped by the watch- 
men or other officers, and plunge themselves into the water wherever they 
found it. 

It often pierced my very soul to hear the groans and cries of those who were 
thus tormented, but of the wo this was counted the most promising particular 
in the whole infection, for, if these swellings could be brought to a head, and 
to break and run, or, as the surgeons call it, to digest, the patient generally 
recovered; whereas those who, like the gentlewoman’s daughter, were struck 
with death at the beginning, and had the tokens come out upon them, often 
went about indifferent easy till a little before they died, and some till the 
moment they dropped down, as in apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case. 
Such would be taken suddenly very sick, and would run to a bench or bulk, or 
any convenient place that offered itself, or to their own houses if possible, as I 
mentioned before, and there sit down, grow faint, and die. This kind of dying 
was much the same as it was with those who die of common mortifications, 
who die swooning, and, as it were, go away in a dream. Such as died thus had 
very little notice of their being infected at all till the gangrene was spread 
through their whole body; nor could physicians themselves know certainly 
how It was with them, till they opened their breasts^ or ^ther parts of their 
body, and saw the tokens. 

We had at this time a great many frightful stories told us of nurses and 
watchmen who looked after the dying people; that is to say, hired nurses, who 
attended infected people, using them barbarously, starving them, smothering 
them, or by other wicked means hastening their end, that is to say, murdering 
of them; and watchmen, being set to guard houses that were shut up when 
there has been but one person left, and perhaps that one lying sick, that they 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 413 

have broke in and murdered that body, and immediately thrown them out into 
the dead-cart! and so they have gone scarce cold to the grave. 

I cannot say but that some such murders were committed, and I think two 
were sent to prison for it, but died before they could be tried; and I have 
heard that three others, at several times, were excused for murders of that kind; 
but 1 must say I believe nothing of its being so common a crime as some have 
since been pleased to say, nor did it seem to be so rational where the people 
were brought so low as not to be able to help themselves, for such seldom 
recovered, and there was no temptation to commit a murder, at least none 
equal to the fact, where they were sure persons would die in so short a time, 
and could not live. 

That there were a great many robberies and wicked practices committed 
even in this dreadful time I do not deny. The power of avarice was so strong 
in some that they would run any hazard to steal and to plunder; and particu- 
larly in houses w'here all the families or inhabitants have been dead and carried 
out, they would break in at all hazards, and without regard to the danger of 
infection, take even the clothes off the dead bodies and the bed-clothes from 
others where they lay dead. 

This, 1 suppose, must be the case of a family in Houndsditch, where a man 
and his daughter, the rest of the family being, as I suppose, carried away before 
by the dead-cart, were found stark naked, one in one chamber and one in 
another, lying dead on the floor, and the clothes of the beds, from whence ’tis 
supposed they were rolled off by thieves, stolen and carried quite away. 

It is indeed to be observed that the women were in all this calamity the most 
rash, fearless, and desperate creatures, and as there were vast numbers that 
went about as nurses to tend those that were sick, they committed a great many 
petty thieveries in the houses where they were employed; and some of them 
were publicly whipped for it, when perhaps they ought rather to have been 
hanged for examples, for numbers of houses were robbed on these occasions, 
till at length the parish f)fliccrs were sent to recommend nurses to the sick, and 
always took an account whom it was they sent, so as that they might call them 
to account if the house had been abused where they were placed. 

But these robberies extended chiefly to wearing-clothes, linen, and what rings 
or money they could come at when the person died who w^as under their care, 
but not to a general plunder of the houses; and I could give you an account of 
one of these nurses, who, several years after, being on her deathbed, confessed 
with the utmost horror the robberies she had committed at the time of her 
being a nurse, and by which she had enriched herself to a great degree. But as 
for murders, I do not find that there was ever any proof of the facts in the 
manner as it has been reported, except as above. 

They did tell me, indeed, of a nurse in one place that laid a wet cloth upon 
the face of a dying patient whom she tended, and so put an end to his life, who 
was just expiring before; and another that smothered a young woman she was 
looking to when she was in a fainting fit, and would have come to herself; 
some that killed them by giving them one thing, some another, and some 
starved them by giving them nothing at all. But these stories had two marks 



414 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

of suspicion that always attended them, which caused me always to slight 
them, and to look on them as mere stories, that people continually frighted 
one another with. First, that wherever it was that we heard it, they dways 
placed the scene at the farther end of the town, opposite or most remote from 
where you were to hear it. If you heard it in Whitechapel, it had happened at 
St. Giles’s, or at Westminster, or Holbom, or that end of the town. If you 
heard of it at that end of the town, then it was done in Whitechapel, or the 
Minories, or about Cripplegate parish. If you heard of it in the city, why, then 
it happened in Southwark; and if you heard of it in Southwark, then it was 
done in the city, and the like. 

In the next place, of what part soever you heard the story, the particulars 
were always the same, especially that of laying a wet double clout on a dying 
man’s face, and that of smothering a young gentlewoman; so that it was 
apparent, at least to my judgment, that there was more of tale than of truth 
in those things. 

However, I cannot say but it had some effect upon the people, and particu- 
larly that, as I said before, they grew more cautious whom they took into their 
houses, and whom they trusted their lives with, and had them always recom- 
mended if they could; and where they could not find such, for they were not 
very plenty, they applied to the parish officers. 

But here again the misery of that time lay upon the poor, who, being 
infected, had neither food or physic, neither physician or apothecary to assist 
them, or nurse to attend them. Many of those died calling for help, and even 
for sustenance, out at their window^s, in a most miserable and deplorable 
manner; but it must be added that whenever the cases of such persons or 
families were represented to my Lord Mayor they always were relieved. 

It is true, in some houses where the people were not very poor, yet where 
they had sent perhaps their wives and children away, and if they had any 
servants they had been dismissed;— I say, it is true, that to save the expenses, 
many such as these shut themselves in, and not having help, died alone. 

A neighbour and acquaintance of mine, having some money owing to him 
from a shopkeeper in Whitecross Street or thereabouts, sent his apprentice, a 
youth about eighteen years of age, to endeavour to get the money. He came 
to the door, and finding it shut, knocked pretty hard, and, as he thought, heard 
somebody answer within, but was not sure, so he waited, and after some stay 
knocked again, and then a third time, when he heard somebody coming 
downstairs. 

At length the man of the house came to the door; he had on his breeches or 
drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of slipped-shoes, 
a white cap on his head, and, as the young man said, “death in his race.” 

When he opened the door, says he, “What do you disturb me thus for?” The 
boy, though a little surprised, replied, “I come from such a one, and my master 
sent me mr the money which he says you know of.” “Very well, child,” 
returns the living ghost; “call as you go by at Cripplegate Church, and bid 
them ring the bell;” and with these words shut the door again, and went up 
again, and died the same day; nay, perhaps the same hour. This the young man

tol4 ine himself, and I have reason to believe it. This was while the plague was 
not come to a height: I think it was in June, towards the latter end of the 
month; it must be before the dead-carts came about, and while they used the 
ceremony of ringing the bell for the dead, which was over for certain, in that 
parish at least, before the month of July, for by the 25th of July there died 
550 and upwards in a week, and then they could no more bury in form, rich or 
poor. 

I have mentioned above that notwithstanding this dreadful calamity, yet the 
number of thieves were abroad upon all occasions, where they had found any 
prey, and that these were generally women. It was one morning about eleven 
o’clock, I had walked out to my brother’s house in Coleman Street parish, as I 
often did, to sec that all was safe. 

My brother’s house had a little court before it, and a brick wall and a gate 
in it, and within that several warehouses where his goods of several sorts lay. 
It happened that in one of these warehouses w^ere several packs of women’s 
high-crowned hats, which came out of the country, and were, as I suppose, for 
exportation, whither 1 know not. 

1 was surprised that when I came near my brother’s door, which was in a 
place they called Swan Alley, 1 met three or four women with high-crowned 
hats on their heads; and, as 1 remembered afterwards, one, if not more, had 
some hats likewise in their hands; but as 1 did not see them come out at my 
brother’s door, and not knowing that my brother had any such goods in his 
warehouse, I did nor offer to say anything to them, but went across the way to 
shun meeting them, as was usual to do at that time, for fear of the plague. But 
when I came nearer to the gate, 1 met another woman with more hats come 
out of the gate. “What business, mistress,” said I, “have you had there?” 
“There are more people there,” said she; “1 have had no more business there 
than they.” I was hasty to get to the gate then, and said no more to her, by 
which means she got away. But just as I came to the gate, 1 saw two more 
coming across the yard to come out with hats also on their heads and under 
their arms, at which 1 threw the gate to behind me, which having a spring lock 
fastened itself; and turning to the women, “Forsooth,” said I, “what are yon 
doing here?” and seized upon the hats, and took them from them. One of 
them, who, 1 confess, did not look like a thief— “Indeed,” says she, “we are 
wrong, but we were told they were goods that had no owner. Be pleased to 
take them again; and look yonder, there are more such customers as we.” She 
cried and looked pitifully, so 1 took the hats from her, and opened the gate, and 
bade them be gone, for I pitied the women indeed; but when I looked towards 
the warehouse, as she directed, there were six or seven more, all women, fitting 
themselves with hats, as unconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter’s 
shop buying for their money. 

1 was surprised, not at the sight of so many thieves only, but at the circunt- 
stances I was in; being now to thrust myself in among so many people, who 
for some weeks had been so shy of myself, that if I met anybody in the street 
I would cross the way from them. 

They were equally surprised, though on another account. They all told me 



416 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

they were neighbours, that they had heard any one might take them, that they 
were nobody’s goods, and the like. I talked big to them at first, went back to 
the gate and took out the key, so that they were all my prisoners, threatened to 
lock them all into the warehouse, and go and fetch my Lord Mayor’s officers 
for them. 

They begged heartily, protested they found the gate open, and the ware- 
house door open; and that it had no doubt been broken open by some who 
expected to find goods of greater value, which indeed was reasonable to 
believe, because the lock was broke, and a padlock that hung to the door on 
the outside also loose, and not abundance of the hats carried away. 

At length 1 considered that this was not a time to be cruel and rigorous; and 
besides that, it would necessarily oblige me. to go much about, to have several 
people come to me, and I go to several whose circumstances of health I 
knew nothing of; and that even at this time the plague was so high as that 
there died 4000 a week; ’so that in showing my resentment, or even in seeking 
justice for my brother’s goods, 1 might lose my own life; so 1 contented my- 
self with taking the names and places where some of them lived, who were 
really inhabitants in the neighbourhood, and threatening that my brother 
should call them to an account for it when he returned to his habitation. 

Then I talked a little upon another foot with them, and asked them how 
they could do such things as these in a time of such general calamity, and, as 
it were, in the face of God’s most dreadful judgments, when the plague was 
at their very doors, and, it may be, in their very houses, and they did not know 
but that the dead-cart might stop at their doors in a few hours, to carry them 
to their graves. 

I could not perceive that my discourse made much impression upon them 
all that while, till it happened that there came two men of the neighbourhood, 
hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my brother, for they had been both 
dependents upon his family, and they came to my assistance. These being, 
as I said, neighbours, presently knew three of the women, and told me who 
they were, and where they lived; and, it seems, they had given me a true 
account of themselves before. 

This brings these two men to a further remembrance. The name of one was 
John Hayward, who was at that time under-sexton of the parish of St. Stephen, 
Coleman Street. By under-sexton was understood at that time gravedigger 
and bearer of the dead. This man carried, or assisted to carry, all the dead to 
their graves which were buried in that large parish, and who were carried in 
form, and after that form of burying was stopped, went with the dead-cart 
and the bell to fetch the dead bodies from the houses where they lay, and 
fetched many of them out of the chambers and houses; for the parish was, 
and is still, remarkable particularly, above all the parishes in London, for a 
great number of alleys and thoroughfares, very long, into which no carts 
could come, and where they were obliged to ^o and fetch the bodies a very 
long way; which alleys now remain to witness it, such as White’s Alley, Cross 
Key Court, Swan Alley, Bell Alley, White Horse Alley, and many more. 
Here they went with a kind of hand-barrow and laid the dead bodies on it, 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 417 

and carried them out to the carts; which work he performed and never had 
the distemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it, and was sexton of 
the parish to the time of his death. His wife at the same time was a nurse to 
infected people, and tended many that died in the parish, being for her honesty 
recommended by the parish officers, yet she never was infected neither. 

He never used any preservative against the infection, other than holding 
garlic and rue in his mouth, and smoking tobacco. This 1 also had from his own 
mouth. And his wife’s remedy was washing her head in vinegar, and sprinkling 
her head-clothes so with vinegar as to keep them always moist; and if the smell 
of any of those she waited on was more than ordinary offensive, she snuffed 
vinegar up her nose and sprinkled vinegar upon her head-clothes, and held a 
handkerchief wetted with vinegar to her mouth. 

It must be confessed that though the plague was chiefly among the poor, yet 
were the poor the most venturous and fearless of it, and went about their 
employment with a sort of brutal courage; 1 must call it so, for it was 
founded neither on religion nor prudence; scarce did they use any caution, but 
ran into any business which they could get employment in, though it was the 
most hazardous. Such was that of tending the sick, watching houses shut up, 
carrying infected jiersons to the pest-house, and, which was still worse, 
carrying the dead away to their graves. 

It was under this John Hayward’s care, and within his bounds, that the story 
of the piper, with which people have made themselves so merry, happened, 
and he assured me that it was true. It is said tliat it was a blind piper; but, as 
John told me, the fellow was not blind, but an ignorant, weak, poor man, and 
usually walked his rounds about ten o’clock at night and went piping along 
from door to door, and the people usually took him in at public-houses where 
they knew him, and would give him drink and victuals, and sometimes far- 
things; and he in return would pipe and sing and talk simply, which diverted 
the people; and thus he lived. It was but a very bad time for this diversion 
while things were as I have told, yet the poor fellow went about as usual, but 
was almost starved; and wffien anybody asked how he did he would answer, the 
dead-cart had not taken him yet, but that they had promised to call for him 
next week. 

It happened one night that this poor fellow, whether somebody had given 
him too much drink or no— John Hayward said he had not drink in his house, 
but that they had given him a little more victuals than ordinary at a public- 
house in Coleman Street— and the poor fellow, having not usually had a 
bellyful for perhaps not a good while, was laid all along upon the top of a 
bulk or stall, and fast asleep, at a door in the street near London Wall, towards 
Cripplegate, and that upon the same bulk or stall the people of some house, in 
the alley of which the house was a corner, hearing a bell, which they always 
rang before the cart came, had laid a body really dead of the plague just by 
him, thinking, too, that this poor fellow had been a dead body, as the other 
was, and laid there by some of the neighbours. 

Accordingly, when John Hayward with his bell and the cart came along, 
finding two dead bodies lie upon the stall, they took them up with the instru- 



418 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

mcnt they used and threw them into the cart, and all this while the piper slept 
soundly. 

From hence they passed along and took in other dead bodies, till, as honest 
John Hayward told me, they almost buried him alive in the cart; yet all this 
while he slept soundly. At length the cart came to the place where the bodies 
were to be thrown into the ground, which, as 1 do remember, was at Mount 
Mill; and as the cart usually stopped some time before they were ready to 
shoot out the melancholy load they had in it, as soon as the cart stopped the 
fellow awaked and struggled a little to get his head out from among thcj dead 
bodies, when, raising himself up in the cart, he called out, “Hey! where 1?” 
This frighted the fellow that attended about the work, but after some pause 
John Hayward, recovering himself, said, “Lord, bless us! There’s somq^ody 
in the cart not quite dead!” So another called to him and said, “Who are yipu?” 
The fellow answered, “I am the poor piper. Where am 1?” “Where are you?” 
says Hayward. “Why, you are in the dead-cart, and we are going to bury 
you.” “But I an’t dead though, am I?” says the piper, which made them laugh 
a little, though, as John said, they were heartily frighted at first; so they helped 
the poor fellow down, and he went about his business. 

I know the story goes he set up his pipes in the cart and frighted the bearers 
and others so that they ran away; but John Hayward did not tell the story 
so, nor say anything of his piping at all; but that he was a poor piper, and that 
he was carried away as above I am fully satisfied of the truth of. 

It is to be noted here that the dead-carts in the city w^ere not confined to 
particular parishes, but one cart went through several parishes, according as 
the number of dead presented; nor were they tied to carry the dead to their 
respective parishes, but many of the dead taken up in the city were carried to 
the burying-ground in the out-parts for want of room. 

I have already mentioned the surprise that this judgment was at first among 
the people. I must be allowed to give some of my observations on the more 
serious and religious part. Surely never city, at least of this bulk and magnitude, 
was taken in a condition so perfectly unprepared for such a dreadful visitation, 
whether I am to speak of the civil preparations or religious. They were, indeed, 
as if they had had no warning, no expectation, no apprehensions, and con- 
sequently the least provision imaginable was made for it in a public way. For 
example, the Lord Mayor and sheriffs had made no provision as magistrates 
for the regulations which were to be observed. They had gone into no 
measures for relief of the poor. The citizens had no public magazines or store- 
houses for corn or meal for the subsistence of the poor, which if they had 
provided themselves, as in such cases is done abroad,- mafiy miserable families, 
who were now reduced to the utmost distress, would have been relieved, and 
that in a better manner than now could be done. 

The stock of the city’s money I can say but little to. The Chamber of 
London was said to be exceeding rich, and it may be concluded that they were 
so, by the vast sums of money issued from thence in the rebuilding the public 
edifices after thje fire of London, and in building new works, such as, for the 
first part, the Guildhall, Blackwell Hall, part of Leadenhall, half the Exchange, 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 419 

the Session House, the Compter, the prisons of Ludgate, Newgate, &c., several 
of the wharfs and stairs and landing-places on the river; all which were either 
burned down or damaged by the great fire of London, the next year after the 
plague; and of the second sort, the Monument, Fleet Ditch with its bridges, and 
the Hospital of Bethlem or Bedlam, &c. But possibly the managers of the city’s 
credit at that time made more conscience of breaking in upon the orphan’s 
money to show charity to the distressed citizens than the managers m the 
following years did to beautify the city and re-edify the buildings, though, in 
the first case, the losers would have thought their fortunes better bestowed, 
and the public faith of the city have been less subjected to scandal and 
reproach. 

It must be acknowledged that the absent citizens, who, though they were 
fled for safety into the country, were yet greatly interested in the welfare of 
those whom they left behind, forgot not to contribute liberally to the relief of 
the poor, and large sums were also collected anio^ig trading towns in the 
remotest parts of England; and, as I have heard also, the nobility and the 
gentry in all parts of England took the deplorable condition of the city into 
their consideration, and sent up large sums of money in charity to the Lord 
Mayor and magistrates for the relief of the poor. The king also, as I was told, 
ordered a thousand pounds a week to be distributed in four parts: one quarter 
to the city and liberty of Westminster; one quarter or part among the in- 
habitants of the Southwark side of the water; one quarter to the liberty and 
parts within of the city, exclusive of the city within the walls; and onc-tourth 
part to the suburbs in the county of Middlesex, and the east and north parts 
of the city. Bur this latter I only speak of as a report. 

Certain it is, the greatest part of the poor or families who formerly lived by 
their labour, or by retail trade, lived now on charity; and had there not been 
prodigious sums of money given by charitable, well-minded Christians for the 
support of such, the city could never have subsisted. There were, no question, 
accounts kept of their charity, and of the just distribution of it by the 
magistrates. But as such multitudes of those very officers died through whose 
hands it was distributed, and also that, as I have been told, most of the accounts 
of those things were lost in the great fire which happened in the very next year, 
and which burnt even the chamberlain’s ofiice and many of their papers, so I 
could never come at the particular account, which I used great endeavours to 
have seen. 

It may, however, be a direction in case of the approach of a like visitation, 
which God keep the city from;~I say, it may be of use to observe that by the 
care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at that time in distributing weekly great 
sums of money for relief of the poor, a multitude of people, who would other- 
wise have perished, were relieved, and their lives preserved. And here let me 
enter into a brief state of the case of the poor at that time, and what way 
apprehended from them, from whence may be judged hereafter what may be 
expected if the like distress should come upon the city. 

At the beginning of the plague, when there was now no more hope but that 
the whole city would be visited; when, as I have said, all that had friends or 



420 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


estates in the country retired with their families; and when, indeed, one would 
have thought the very city itself was running out of the gates, and that there 
would be nobody left behind; you may be sure from that hour all trade, except 
such as related to immediate subsistence, was, as it were, at a full stop. 

This is so lively a case, and contains in it so much of the real condition of the 
people, that I think I cannot be too particular in it, and therefore I descend to 
the several arrangements or classes of people who fell into immediate distress 
upon this occasion. For example:— 

1. AU master- workmen in manufactures, especially such as belonged to ornament, 
and the less necessary parts of the people’s dress, clothes, and furniture for houses, 
such as riband-weavers and other weavers, gold and silver lace makers, and gold 
and silver wire drawers, sempstresses, milliners, shoemakers, hatmakers, and glove- 
makers; also upholsterers, joiners, cabinet-makers, looking-glass makers, and in- 
numerable trades which depend upon such as these;~I say, the mastcr-woikmen 
in such stopped their work, dismissed tlieir journeymen and workmen, and ail their 
dependents. 

2. As merchandising was at a full stop, for very few ships ventured to come up 
the river, and none at all went out, so all the extraordinary officers of the customs, 
likewise the watermen, carmen, porters, and all the poor, whose labour depended 
upon the merchants, were at once dismissed, and put out of business. 

3. All the tradesmen usually employed in building or repairing of houses were 
at a full stop, for the people were far from wanting to build houses when so many 
thousand houses were at once stripped of their inhabitants; so tliat this one article 
turned all the ordinary workmen of tliat kind out of business, such as bricklayers, 
masons, carpenters. Joiners, plasterers, painters, glaziers, smiths, plumbers, and all 
the labourers depending on such. 

4. As navigation was at a stop, our ships neither coming in or going out as before, 
so the seamen were all out of employment, and many of them in the last and lowest 
degree of distress; and with the seamen were all the several tradesmen and workmen 
belonging to and depending upon the building and fitting out of ships, such as 
ship-carpenters, caulkers, ropemakers, dry coopers, sailmakers, anchorsmiths, and 
other smiths; blockmakers, carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship-carvers, and 
the like. The masters of those perhaps might live upon their substance, but the 
traders were universally at a stop, and consequently all their workmen discharged. 
Add to these that the river was in a manner without boats, and all or most part of 
the watermen, lightermen, boat-builders, and lighter-builders, in like manner idle 
and laid by. 

5. All families retrenched their living as much as possible, as well those that fled as 
those that stayed; so that an innumerable multitude of footmen, serving-men, shop- 
keepers, journeymen, merchants’ bookkeepers, and such sort of people, and espe- 
cially poor maid-servants, were turned off, and left friendless and helpless, without 
employment and without habitation, and this was really a (iismal article. 

I might be more particular as to this part, but it may suffice to mention in 
general, all trades being stopped, employment ceased, the labour, and by that 
the bread, of the poor were cut off; and at first indeed the cries of the poor 
were most lamentable to hear, though by the distribution of charity their 
misery that way was greatly abated. Many indeed fled into the counties, but 
thousands of them having stayed in London till nothing but desperation sent 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 421 

them away, death overtook them on the road, and they served for no better 
than the messengers of death; indeed, others carrying the infection along with 
them, spread it very unhappily into the remotest parts of the kingdom. 

Many of these were the miserable objects of despair which I have mentioned 
before, and were removed by the destruction which followed. These might be 
said to perish, not by the infection itself, but by the consequence of it; indeed, 
namely, by hunger and distress, and the want of all things, being without 
lodging, without money, without friends, without means to get their bread, 
or without any one to give it them; for many of them were without what we 
call legal settlements, and so could not claim of the parishes, and all the support 
they had was by application to the magistrates for relief, which relief was 
(to give the magistrates their due) carefully and cheerfully administered, as 
they found it necessary, and those that stayed behind never felt the want and 
distress of that kind, which they felt who went away in the manner above 
noted. 

Let any one who is acquainted with what multitudes of people get their daily 
bread in this city by their labour, whether artificers or mere workmen— I say, 
let any man consider what must be the miserable condition of this town if, on 
a sudden, they should be all turned out of employment, that labour should 
cease, and wages for work be no more. 

This was the case wdth us at that time; and had not the sums of money con- 
tributed in charity by well-disposed people of every kind, as well abroad as at 
home, been prodigiously great, it had not been in the power of the Lord Mayor 
and sheriffs to have kept the public peace. Nor were they without apprehen- 
sions, as it was, that desperation should push the people upon tumults, and 
cause them to rifle the houses of rich men and plunder the markets of provi- 
sions; in which case the country people, who brought provisions very freely 
and boldly to tow n, would have been terrified from coming any more, and the 
town would have sunk under an unavoidable famine. 

But the prudence of my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen within the 
city, and of the justices of peace in the out-parts, was such, and they were 
supported with money from all parts so well, that the poor people were kept 
quiet, and their wants everywhere relieved, as far as was possible to be done. 

Two things besides this contributed to prevent the mob doing any mischief. 
One was, that really the rich themselves had not laid up stores of provisions in 
their houses, as indeed they ought to have done, and which if they had been 
wise enough to have done, and locked themselves entirely up, as some few did, 
they had perhaps escaped the disease better. But as it appeared they had not, so 
the mob had no notion of finding stores of provisions there if they had broken 
in, as it is plain they were sometimes very near doing, and which, if they had, 
they had finished the ruin of the whole city, for there were no regular troops 
to have withstood them, nor could the trained bands have been brought 
together to defend the city, no men being to be found to bear arms. 

But the vigilance of the Lord Mayor and such magistrates as could be had 
(for some, even of the aldermen, were dead, and some absent) prevented this; 
and they did it by the most kind and gentle methods they could think of, as 



422

particularly by relieving the most desperate with money, and putting others 
into business, and particularly that employment of watching houses that were 
infected and shut up. And as the number of these were very great, for it was 
said there was at one time ten thousand houses shut up, and every house had 
two watchmen to guard it, viz., one by night and the other by day, this gave 
opportunity to employ a very great number of poor men at a time. 

The women and servants that were turned off from their places were 
Ekewise employed as nurses to tend the sick in all places, and this took off a 
very great number of them. 

And, which though a melancholy article in itself, yet was a deliverince in 
its land, namely, the plague, which raged in a dreadful manner from the 
middle of August to the middle of October, carried off in that time th^ty or 
forty thousand of these very people, which, had they been left, would certainly 
have been an insufferable burden by their poverty; that is to say, the V^hole 
city could not have supported the expense of them, or have provided food 
for them; and they would in time have been even driven to the necessity of 
plundering either the city itself or the country adjacent, to have subsisted 
themselves, which would, first or last, have put the whole nation, as well as the 
city, into the utmost terror and confusion. 

It was observable, then, that this calamity of the people made them very 
humble; for now for about nine weeks together there died near a thousand a 
day, one day with another, even by the account of the weekly bills, which yet, 
I have reason to be assured, never gave a full account, by many thousands, the 
confusion being such, and the carts working in the dark when they carried the 
dead, that in some places no account at all was kept, but they worked on, the 
cleric and sextons not attending for weeks together, and not knowing what 
number they carried. This account is verified by the following bills of 
mortality:—

So that the gross of the people were carried off in these two months; for, as 
the whole number which was brought in to die of the plague was but 68,590, 
here is 50,000 of them, within a trifle, in two months; I say 50,000, because, as 
there wants 295 in the number above, so there wants two days of two 
months in the account of time. 

Now, when I say that the parish officers did not give in a full account, or 
were not to be depended upon for their account, let any one but consider how 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 423 

men could be exact in such a time of dreadful distress, and when many of 
them were taken sick themselves, and perhaps died in the very time when their 
accounts were to be given in; I mean the parish clerks, besides inferior officers; 
for though these poor men ventured at all hazards, yet they were far from 
being exempt from the common calamity, especially if it be true that the parish 
of Stepney had, within the year, ii6 sextons, gravediggers, and their assistants; 
that is to say, bearers, bellmen, and drivers of carts for carrying off the dead 
bodies. 

Indeed the work was not of a nature to allow them leisure to take an exact 
talc of the dead bodies, which were all huddled together in the dark into a pit; 
w^hich pit or trench no man could come nigh but at the utmost peril. I observed 
often that in the parishes of Aldgate and Cripplegatc, Whitechapel and Step- 
ney, there were five, six, seven, and eight hundred in a week in the bills, 
whereas, if we may believe the opinion of those that lived in the city all the 
time as well as 1 , there died sometimes 2000 a week in those parishes; and I 
saw it under the hand of one that made as strict an examination into that part 
as he could, that there really died an hundred thousand people of the plague in 
that one year, whereas in the bills, the articles of the plague, it was but 68,590. 

If I may be allowed to give my opinion, by what I saw with my eyes and 
heard from other people that were cyc-witnesscs, I do verily believe the same, 
viz., that there died at least 100,000 of the plague only, besides other distempers, 
and besides those which died in the fields and highways and secret places out 
of the compass of the communication, as it was called, and who were not put 
down in the bills, though they really belonged to the body of the inhabitants. 
It was known to us all that abundance of poor despairing creatures who had 
the distemper upon them, and were grown stupid or melancholy by their 
misery, as many were, wandered away into the fields and woods, and into 
secret, uncouth places, almost anywhere, to creep into a bush or hedge and die. 

The inhabitants of the villages adjacent would, in pity, carry them food, 
and set it at a distance, that they might fetch it, if they were able; and some- 
times they were not able, and the next time they went they should find the 
poor wretches lie dead and the food untouched. The number of these 
miserable objects were many, and I know so many that perished thus, and so 
exactly where, that I believe I could go to the very place and dig their bones 
up still; for the country people would go and dig a hole at a distance from 
them, and then with long poles, and hooks at the end of them, drag the bodies 
into these pits, and then throw the earth in from as far as they could cast it, 
to cover them, taking notice how the wind blew, and so coming on that side 
which the seamen call to windward, that the scent of the bodies might blow 
from them; and thus great numbers went out of the world, who were never 
known, or any account of them taken, as well witliin the bills of mortality as 
without. 

This, indeed, I had in the main only from the relation of others, for I 
seldom walked into the fields, except towards Bethnal Green and Hackney, or 
as hereafter. But when I did walk, I always saw a great many poor wanderers at 
a distance; but I could know little of their cases, for whether it were in the 



424 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


street or in the fields, if we had seen anybody coming, it was a general method 
to walk away; yet I believe the account is exactly true. 

As this puts me upon mentioning my walking the streets and fields, I cannot 
omit taking notice what a desolate place the city was at that time. The great 
street I lived in, which is known to be one of the broadest of all the streets of 
London, I mean of the suburbs as well as the liberties, all the side where the 
butchers lived, especially without the bars, was more like a green field than a 
paved street, and the people generally went in the middle with the horses and 
carts. It is true that the farthest end towards Whitechapel Church was not all 
paved, but even the part that was paved was full of grass also; but thisj need 
not seem strange, since the great streets within the city, such as Leadfcnhall 
Street, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill, and even the Exchange itself, had grass 
growing in them in several places; neither cart or coach were seen in the 
streets from morning to evening, except some country carts to bring roots\and 
beans, or peas, hay, and straw, to the market, and those but very few comp^ed 
to what was usual. As for coaches, they were scarce used bur to carry sick 
people to the pest-house, and to other hospitals, and some few to carry physi- 
cians to such places as they thought fit to venture to visit; for really coaches 
were dangerous things, and people did not care to venture into them, because 
they did not know who might have been carried in them last, and sick, infected 
people were, as I have said, ordinarily carried in them to the pest-houses, and 
sometimes people expired in them as they went along. 

It is true, when the infection came to such a height as I have now mentioned, 
there were very few physicians which cared to stir abroad to sick houses, and 
very many of the most eminent of the faculty were dead, as well as the 
surgeons also; for now it was indeed a dismal time, and for about a month 
together, not taking any notice of the bills of mortality, I believe there did not 
die less than 1500 or 1700 a day, one day with another. 

One of the worst days we had in the whole time, as I thought, was in the 
beginning of September, when, indeed, good people began to think that God 
was resolved to make a full end of the people in this miserable city. This was 
at that time when the plague was fully come into the eastern parishes. The 
parish of Aldgate, if I may give my opinion, buried above a thousand a week 
for two weeks, though the bills did not say so many;--but it surrounded me 
at so dismal a rate that there was not a house in twenty uninfected in the 
Minories, in Houndsditch, and in those parts of Aldgate parish about the 
Butcher Row and the alleys over against me. I say, in those places death reigned 
in every corner. Whitechapel parish was in the same condition, and though 
much less than the parish I lived in, yet buried near 4oo 'a week by the bills, 
and in my opinion near twice as many. Whole families, and indeed whole 
streets of families, were swept away together; insomuch that it was frequent 
for neighbours to call to the bellman to go to such-and-such houses and fetch 
out the people, for that they were all dead. 

And, indeed, the work of removing the dead bodies by carts was now 
grown so very odious and dangerous that it was complained of that the bearers 
did not take care to clear such houses where all the inhabitants were dead, but 



A JOUUNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 425 

that sometimes the bodies lay several days unburied, till the neighbouring 
families were offended with the stench, and consequently infected; and this 
neglect of the officers was such that the churchwardens and constables were 
summoned to look after it, and even the justices of the Hamlets were obliged 
to venture their lives among them to quicken and encourage them, for 
innumerable of the bearers died of the distemper, infected by the bodies they 
were obliged to come so near. And had it not been that the number of poor 
people who wanted employment and wanted bread (as 1 have said before) was 
so great that necessity drove them to undertake anything and venture any- 
thing, they would never have found people to be employed. And then the 
bodies of the dead would have lain above ground, and have perished and rotted 
in a dreadful manner. 

But the magistrates cannot be enough commended in this, that they kept 
such good order for the burying of the dead, that as fast as any of those they 
employed to carry off and bury the dead fell sick or died, as was many times 
the case, they immediately supplied the places with others, which, by reason 
of the great number of poor that was left out of business, as above, was not 
hard to do. This occasioned, that notwithstanding the infinite number of people 
which died and were sick, almost all together, yet they were always cleared 
away and carried off every night, so that it was never to be said of London 
that the living were not able to bury the dead. 

As the desolation was greater during those terrible times, so the amazement 
of the people increased, and a thousand unaccountable things they would do 
in the violence of their fright, as others did the same in the agonies of their 
distemper, and this part was very affecting. Some went roaring and crying and 
wringing their hands along the street; some would go praying and lifting up 
their hands to heaven, calling upon God for mercy. I cannot say, indeed, 
whether this was not in their distraction, but, be it so, it was still an indication 
of a more serious mind, when they had the use of their senses, and was much 
better, even as it was, than the frightful yellings and cryings that every day, 
and especially in the evenings, were heard in some streets. I suppose the world 
has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast. He, though not infected 
at all but in his head, went about denouncing of judgment upon the city in a 
frightful manner, sometimes quite naked, and with a pan of burning charcoal 
on his head. What he said, or pretended, indeed I could not learn. 

1 will not say whether that clergyman was distracted or not, or whether he 
did it in pure zeal for the poor people, who went every evening through the 
streets of Whitechapel, and, with his hands lifted up, repeated that part of the 
Liturgy of the Church continually, “Spare us, good Lord; spare Thy people, 
whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy most precious blood,” I say, I cannot 
speak positively of these things, because these were only the dismal objects 
which represented themselves to me as 1 looked through my chamber windows 
(for I seldom opened the casements), while I confined myself within doors 
during that most violent raging of the pestilence; when, indeed, as I have said, 
many began to think, and even to say, that there would none escape; and 
indeed I began to think so too, and therefore kept within doors for about a 



426 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

fortnight, and never stirred out. But I could not hold it. Besides, there were 
some people who, notwithstanding the danger, did not omit publidy to attend 
the worship of God, even in the most dangerous times; and though it is true 
that a great many clergymen did shut up their churches, and fled, as other 
people did, for the safety of their lives, yet all did not do so. Some ventured to 
officiate and to keep up the assemblies of the people by constant prayers, and 
sometimes sermons or brief exhortations to repentance and reformation, and 
this as long as any would come to hear them. And Dissenters did the like also, 
and even in the very churches where the parish ministers were either <^ead or 
fled; nor was there any room for making difference at such a time as this was. 

It was indeed a lamentable thing to hear the miserable lamentations of poor 
dying creatures calling out for ministers to comfort them and pray with\thcm, 
to counsel them and to direct them, calling out to God for pardon and ihercy, 
and confessing aloud their past sins. It would make the stoutest heart \bleed 
to hear how many warnings were then given by dying penitents to othei^ not 
to put off and delay their repentance to the day of distress; that such a time 
of calamity as this was no time for repentance, was no time to call upon God. 
I wish I could repeat the very sound of those groans and of those exclamations 
that I heard from some poor dying creatures when in the height of their 
agonies and distress, and that I could make him that reads this hear, as I 
imagine I now hear them, for the sound seems still to ring in my ears. 

If I could but tell this part in such moving accents as should alarm the very 
soul of the reader, I should rejoice that I recorded those things, however short 
and imperfect. 

It pleased God that I was still spared, and very hearty and sound in health, 
but very impatient of being pent up within doors without air, as I have been 
for fourteen days or thereabouts, and I could not restrain myself, but 1 would 

f o to carry a letter for my brother to the post-house. Then it was indeed that 
observed a profound silence in the streets. When I came to the post-house, as 
I went to put in my letter, I saw a man stand in one corner of the yard and 
talking to another at a window, and a third had opened a door belonging to 
the office. In the middle of the yard lay a small leather purse with two keys 
hanging at it, with money in it, but nobody would meddle with it, 1 asked 
how long it had lain there; the man at the window said it had lain almost an 
hour, but that they had not meddled with it, because they did not know but 
the person who dropped it might come back to look for it. I had no such need 
of money, nor was the sum so big that I had any inclination to meddle with it, 
or to get the money at the hazard it might be attended with; so I seemed to go 
away, when the man who had opened the door said he^ would take it up, but 
so that if the right owner came for it he should be sure to have it. So he went 
in and fetched a pail of water, and set it down hard by the purse, then went 
again and fetched some gunpowder, and cast a good deal of powder upon the 
purse, and then made a train from that which he had thrown loose upon the 
purse. The trair^eached about two yards. After this he goes in a third time and 
fetches out a pj® of tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, I suppose, on 
purpose, and ^st setting fire to the train of powder, that singed the purse, 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR Ai7 

and also smoked the air sufficiently. But he was not content with that, but he 
then takes up the purse with the tongs, holding it so long till the tongs burnt 
through the purse, and then he shook the money out into the pail of water, so 
he carried it in. The money, as I remember, was about thirteen shillings and 
some smooth groats and brass farthings. 

There might perhaps have been several poor people, as I have observed 
above, that would have been hardy enough to have ventured for the sake of 
the money; but you may easily see by what I have observed that the few 
people who were spared were very careful of themselves at that time when 
the distress was so exceeding great. 

Much about the same time I walked out into the fields towards Bow; for 
1 had a great mind to see how things were managed in the river and among 
the ships; and as I had some concern in shipping, 1 had a notion that it had 
been one of the best ways of securing one’s self from the infection to have 
retired into a ship; and musing how to satisfy my curiosity in that point, I 
turned away over the fields from Bow to Bromley, and down to Blackwall 
to the stairs, which are there for landing or taking water. 

Here I saw a poor man walking on the bank, or sea-wall, as they call it, 
by himself. I walked a while also about, seeing the houses all shut up. At 
last 1 fell into some talk, at a distance, with this poor man; first 1 asked him 
how people did thereabouts. “Alas, sir!” says he, “almost desolate; all dead 
or sick. Here are very few families in this part, or in that village” (pointing 
at Poplar), “where half of them are not dead already, and the rest sick.” Then 
he pointing to one house, “There they are all dead,” said he, “and the house 
stands open; nobody dares go into it. A poor thief,” says he, “ventured in 
to steal something, but he paid dear for his theft, for he was carried to the 
church-yard too last night.” Then he pointed to several other houses. “There,” 
says he, “they are all dead, the man and his wife, and five children. There,” 
says he, “they are shut up; you see a watchman at the door;” and so of other 
houses. “Why,” says I, “what do you here all alone?” “Why,” says he, “I 
am a poor, desolate man; it has pleased God I am not yet visited, though my 
family is, and one of my children dead.” “How do you mean, then,” said I, 
“that you are not visited?” “Why,” says he, “that’s my house” (pointing to a 
very little, low-boarded house), “and there my poor wife and two children 
live,” said he, “if they may be said to live, for my wife and one of the children 
are visited, but I do not come at them.” And with that word I saw the tears 
run very plentifully down his face; and so they did down mine too, 1 assure you. 

“But,” said I, “why do you not come at them^ How can you abandon your 
own flesh and blood?” “Oh, sir,” says he, “the Lord forbid! I do not abandon 
them; 1 work for them as much as I am able; and, blessed be the Lord, I 
keep them from want;” and with that I observed he lifted up his eyes to 
heaven, with a countenance that presently told me I had happened on a man 
that was no hypocrite, but a serious, religious, good man, and his ejaculation 
was an expression of thankfulness that, in such a condition as he was in, he 
should be able to say his family did not want. “Well,” says I, “honest man, 
that is a great mercy as things go now with the poor. But how do you live,

then, and how are you kept from the dreadful calamity that is now upon 
us all?” “Why, sir,” says he, “I am a waterman, and there’s my boat,” says he, 
“and the boat serves me for a house. 1 work in it in the day, and I sleep in it 
in the night; and what I get I lay down upon that stone,” says he, showing 
me a broad stone on the other side of the street, a good way from his house; 
“and then,” says he, “I halloo, and caU to them till I make them hear; and 
they come and fetch it.” 

“Well, friend,” says I, “but how can you get any money as a waterman? 
Does anybody go by water these times?” “Yes, sir,” says he, “in the way 1 am 
employed there does. Do you see there,” says he, “five ships lie at pnehor” 
(pointing down the river a good way below the town), “and do you se^,” says 
he, “eight or ten ships lie at the chain there, and at anchor yonder?” (pointing 
above the town). “All those ships have families on board, of their me:^chants 
and owners, and such-like, who have locked themselves up and live on board, 
close shut in, for fear of the infection; and I tend on them to fetch things 
for them, carry letters, and do what is absolutely necessary, that they may 
not be obliged to come on shore; and every night I fasten my boat on board 
one of the ship’s boats, and there I sleep by myself, and, blessed be God, I am 
preserved hitherto.” 

“Well,” said 1, “friend, but will they let you come on board after you have 
been on shore here, when this is such a terrible place, and so infected as it is? ” 

“Why, as to that,” said he, “I very seldom go up the ship-side, but deliver 
what I bring to their boat, or lie by the side, and they hoist it on board. If I 
did, I think they are in no danger from me, for I never go into any house on 
shore, or touch anybody, no, not of my own family; but I fetch provisions 
for them.” 

“Nay,” says I, “but that may be worse, for you must have those provisions 
of somebody or other; and since all this part of the town is so infected, it 
is dangerous so much as to speak with anybody, for the village,” said I, “is, 
as it were, the beginning of London, though it be at some distance from it.” 

“That is true,” added he; “but you do not understand me right; 1 do not 
buy provisions for them here. I row up to Greenwich and buy fresh meat 
there, and sometimes 1 row down the river to Woolwich and buy there; then 
I go to single farm-houses on the Kentish side, where I am known, and buy 
fowls and eggs and butter, and bring to the ships, as they direct me, sometimes 
one, sometimes the other. 1 seldom come on shore here, and I came now only 
to call to my wife and hear how my little family do, and give them a little 
money, which I received last night.” 

“Poor man!” said I; ^‘and how much hast thou gotten for them?” 

“I have gotten four shillings,” said he, “which is a great sum, as things go 
now with poor men; but they have given me a bag of bread too, and a salt 
fish and some flesh; so all helps out.” 

“Well,” said I, “and have you given it them yet?’^ 

“No,” said he; “but I have called, and my wife has answered that she can- 
not come out yet, but in half-an-hour she hopes to come, and I am waiting 
for her. Poor woman!” says he, “she is brought sadly down. She has a swelling, 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 429 

and it is broke, and I hope she will recover; but I fear the child will die, but it 
is the Lord—” 

Here he stopped, and wept very much. 

“Well, honest friend,” said I, “thou hast a sure Comforter, if thou hast 
brought thyself to be resigned to the will of God; He is dealing with us all in 
judgment.” 

“Oh, sir!” says he, “it is infinite mercy if any of us arc spared, and who am 
I to repine!” 

“Sayest thou so?” said I, “and how much less is my faith than thine?” And 
here my heart smote me, suggesting how much better this poor man’s founda- 
tion was on which he stayed in the danger than mine; that he had nowhere 
to fly; that he had a family to bind him to attendance, which 1 had not; and 
mine was mere presumption, his a true dependence, and a courage resting on 
God; and yet that he used all possible caution for his safety. 

1 turned a little way from the man while these thoughts engaged me, for, 
indeed, I could no more refrain from tears than he. 

At length, after some further talk, the poor woman opened the door and 
called, “Robert, Robert.” He answered, and bid her stay a few moments and 
he would come; so he ran down the common stairs to his boat and fetched up 
a sack, in which was the provisions he had brought from the ships; and when 
he returned he hallooed again. Then he went to the great stone which he 
showed me and emptied the sack, and laid all out, everything by themselves, 
and then retired; and his wife came with a little boy to fetch them away, and 
he called and said such a captain had sent such a thing, and such a captain such 
a thing, and at the end adds, “God has sent it all; give thanks to Him.” When 
the poor woman had taken up all, she was so weak she could not carry it at 
once in, though the weight was not much neither; so she left the biscuit, which 
was in a little bag, and left a little boy to watch it till she came again. 

“Well, but,” says I to him, “did you leave her the four shillings too, which 
you said was your week’s pay?” 

“Yes, yes,” sa) s he; “you shall hear her own it.” So he calls again, “Rachel, 
Rachel,” which, it seems, was her name, “did you take up the money?” “Yes,” 
said she. “How much was it?” said he. “Four shillings and a groat,” said she. 
“Well, well,” says he, “the Lord keep you all;” and so he turned to go away. 

As I could not refrain contributing tears to this man’s story, so neither 
could I refrain my charity for his assistance. So I called him, “Hark thee, 
friend,” said 1, “come hither, for I believe thou art in health, that I may venture 
thee;” so 1 pulled out my hand, which was in my pocket before, “Here,” says 
I, “go and call thy Rachel once more, and give her a little more comfort from 
me. God will never forsake a family that trust in Him as thou dost.” So 1 gave 
him four other shillings, and bid him go lay them on the stone and call his wife. 

1 have not words to express the poor man’s thankfulness, neither could he 
express it himself but by tears running down his face. He called his wife, and 
told her God had moved the heart of a stranger, upon hearing their condition, 
to give them all that money, and a great deal more such as that he said to her. 
The woman, too, made signs of the like thankfulness, as well to Heaven as 



430

to me, and joyfully picked it up; and I parted with no money all that year 
that I thougnt better bestowed. 

I then asked the poor man if the distemper had not reached to Greenwich. 
He said it had not till about a fortnight before; but that then he feared it had, 
but that it was only at that end of the town which lay south towards Deptford 
Bridge; that he went only to a butcher’s shop and a grocer’s, where he gen- 
erally bought such things as they sent him for, but was very careful. 

I asked him then how it came to pass that those people who had so shut 
themselves up in the ships had not laid in sufficient stores of all things necessary. 
He said some of them had, but, on the other hand, some did not come on 
board till they were frighted into it, and till it was too dangerous foSr them 
to go to the proper people to lay in quantities of things, and that he Waited 
on two ships, which he showed me, that had laid in little or nothing but 
biscuit bread and ship beer, and that he had bought everything else almost 
for them. I asked him if there was any more ships that had separated mem- 
selves as those had done. He told me yes, all the way up from the point, 
right against Greenwich, to within the shore of Limehouse and Redriff, all 
the ships that could have room rid two and two in the middle of the stream, 
and that some of them had several families on board. I asked him if the dis- 
temper had not reached them. He said he believed it had not, except two or 
three ships, whose people had not been so watchful to keep the seamen from 
going on shore, as others had been, and he said it was a very fine sight to see 
how the ships lay up the Pool. 

When he said he was going o\ er to Greenwich as soon as the tide began to 
come in, I asked if he would let me go with him, and bring me back, for 
that I had a great mind to see how the ships were ranged, as he had told me. 
He told me, if I would avssure him on the word of a Christian and of an 
honest man, that I had not the distemper, he would. I assured him that I had 
not; that it had pleased God to preserve me; that I lived in Whitechapel, but 
was too impatient of being so long within doors, and that I had ventured out 
so far for the refreshment of a little air, but that none in my house had so 
much as been touched with it. 

*‘Well, sir,” says he, “as your charity has been moved to pity me and my 
poor family, sure you cannot have so little pity left as to put yourself into 
my boat if you were not sound in health, which would be nothing less than 
killing me, and ruining my whole family.” The poor man troubled me so 
much when he spoke of his family with such a sensible concern, and in such 
an affectionate manner, that 1 could not satisfy myself at first to go at all. 
I told him I would lay aside my curiosity rather than mdee him uneasy, though 
I was sure, and very thankful for it, that I had no more distemper upon me 
than the freshest man in the world. Well, he would not have me put it off 
neither, but, to let me see how confident he was that I was just to him, now 
importuned me to go; so when the tide came up to his boat I went in, and 
he carried me to Greenwich. While he bought the things which he had in 
his charge to buy, I walked up to the top of the hill under which the town 
stands, and on the east side of the town, to get a prospect of the river. But 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 43 ! 

it was a surprising sight to see the number of ships which lay in rows, two 
and two, and some places two or three such lines m the breadth of the river, 
and this not only up quite to the town, between the houses which we call 
Ratcliff and Redriff, which they name the Pool, but even down the whole 
river, as far as the head of Long Reach, which is as far as the hills give us 
leave to see it. 

I cannot guess at the nun\ber of ships, but I think there must be several 
hundreds of sail; and I could not but applaud the contrivance, for ten thousand 
people, and more, who attended ship affairs were certainly sheltered here from 
the violence of the contagion, and lived very safe and very easy. 

I returned to my own dwelling very well satisfied with iny day’s journey, 
and particularly with the poor man; also, I rejoiced to sec that such little 
sanctuaries were provided for so many families in a time of such desolation. 

I observed also, that as the violence of the plague had increased, so the ships 
w^hich had families on board removed and went farther oif, till, as I was told, 
some went quite away to sea, and put into such harbours and safe roads on 
the north coast as they could best come at. 

But it was also true that all the people who thus left the land and lived 
on board the ships were not entirely safe from the infection, for many died 
and were thrown overboard into the river, some in coffins, and some, as I 
heard, without coffins, whose bodies were seen sometimes to drive up and 
down with the tide in the river. 

But I believe I may venture to say that in those ships which were thus 
infected it either happened where the people had recourse to them too late, 
and did not fly to the ship till they had stayed too long on shore and had the 
distemper upon them, though perhaps they might nor perceive it, and so the 
distemper did not come to them on board the ships, but they really carried it 
with them; or it was in these ships where the poor waterman said they had 
not had rime to furnish themselves with provisions, but were obliged to send 
often on shore to buy what they had occasion for, or suffered boats to come 
to them from the shore. And so the distemper was brought insensibly among 
them. 

And here I cannot but take notice that the strange temper of the people 
of London at that time contribute^d extremely to their own destruction. The 
plague began, as I have observed, at the other end of the town, namely, in 
Long Acre, Drury Lane, &c., and came on towards the city very gradually 
and slowly. It was felt at first in December, then again in February, then 
again in April, and always but a very little at a time; then it stopped till May, 
and even the last week in May there was but seventeen, and all at that end 
of the town; and all this while, even so long as till there died above 3000 a 
week, yet had the people in Redriff, and in Wapping and Ratcliff, on both sides 
the river, and almost all Southwark side, a mighty fancy that they should 
not be visited, or at least that it would not be so violent among them. Some 
people fancied the smell of the pitch and tar, and such other things as oil and 
rosin and brimstone, which is so much used by all trades relating to shipping, 
would preserve them. Others argued it, because it was in its extremest violence 



432

in Westminster and the parish of St. Giles and St. Andrew, &c., and began to 
abate again before it came among them, which was true indeed, in part. 
For example— 

From the 8th to the 15th August—

From the 15th to the 22nd August

N.iB.— That it was observed the numbers mentioned in Stepney parish at 
that time were generally all on that side where Stepney parish joined to 
Shoreditch, which we now call Spitalfields, where the parish of Stepney comes 
up to the very w^all of Shoreditch Churchyard, and the plague at this time 
was abated at St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and raged most violently in Cripplegate, 
Bishopsgatc, and Shoreditch parishes; but there was not ten people a week that 
died of it in all that part of Stepney parish which takes in Limehouse, Ratcliff 
Highway, and which are now the parishes of Shadwell and Wapping, even to 
St. Catherine’s by the Tower, till after the whole month of August was 
expired. But they paid for it afterwards, as I shall observe by-and-by. 

This, I say, made the people of Redriff and Wapping, Ratcliff and Lime- 
house, so secure, and flatter themselves so much with the plague’s going off 
without reaching them, that they took no care either to fly into the country 
or shut themselves up. Nay, so far were they from stirring that they rather 
received their friends and relations from the city into their houses, and 
several from other places really took sanctuary in that part of the town as a 
place of safety, and as a place which they thought God would pass over, and 
not visit as the rest was visited. 

And this was the reason that when it came upon them they were more 
surprised, more unprovided, and more at a loss what to do than they were 
in other places; for when it came among them really and with violence, as 
it did indeed in September and October, there was then no stirring out into 
the country, nobody would suffer a stranger to come near them, no, nor near 
the towns w'here they dwelt; and, as I have been told, several that wandered 
into the country on Surrey side were found starved to death in the woods and 
commons, that country being more open and more woody than any other 
part so near London, especially about Norwood and the parishes of Camber- 
well, Dulwich, and Lusum, where, it seems, nobody durst relieve the poor 
distressed people for fear of the infection.

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 433 

This notion having, as I said, prevailed with the people in that part of the 
town, was in part the occasion, as I said before, that they had recourse to 
ships for their retreat; and where they did this early and with prudence, 
furnishing themselves so with provisions that they had no need to go on 
shore for supplies or suffer boats to come on board to bring them, —I say, 
where they did so they had certainly the safest retreat of any people what- 
soever; but the distress was such that people ran on board, in their fright, 
without bread to eat, and some into ships that had no men on board to 
remove them farther off, or to take the boat and go down the river to buy 
provisions where it might be done safely, and tliese often suffered and were 
infected on board as much as on shore. 

As the richer sort got into ships, so the lower rank got into hoys, smacks, 
lighters, and fishing-boats; and many, especially watermen, lay in their boats; 
but those made sad work of it, especially the latter, for, going about for 
provision, and perhaps to get their subsistence, the infection got in among 
them and made a fearful havoc; many of the watermen died alone in their 
wherries as they rid at their roads, as well above bridge as below, and were 
not found sometimes till they were not in condition for anybody to touch 
or come near them. 

Indeed, the distress of the people at this seafaring end of the town was very 
deplorable, and deserved the greatest commiseration. But, alas! this was a 
time when every one’s private safety lay so near them that they had no room 
to pity the distresses of others; for every one had death, as it were, at his 
door, and many even in their families, and knew not what to do or whither 
to fly. 

This, I say, took away all compassion; self-preservation, indeed, appeared 
here to be the first law. For the children ran away from their parents as 
they languished in the utmost distress. And in some places, though not so 
frequent as the other, parents did the like to their children; nay, some dreadful 
examples there were, and particularly two in one week, of distressed mothers, 
raving and distracted, killing their own children; one whereof was not far 
off from where I dwelt, the poor lunatic creature not living herself long 
enough to be sensible of the sin of what she had done, much less to be pun- 
ished for it. 

It is not, indeed, to be wondered at, for the danger of immediate death to 
ourselves took away all bowels of love, all concern for one another. I speak 
in general, for there were many instances of immovable affection, pity, and 
duty in many, and some that came to my knowledge, that is to say, by 
hearsay; for I shall not take upon me to vouch the truth of the particulars. 

To introduce one, let me first mention that one of the most deplorable 
cases in all the present calamity was that of women with child, who, when 
they came to the hour of their sorrows and their pains come upon them, 
could neither have help of one kind or another; neither midwife or neighbour- 
ing women to come near them. Most of the midwives were dead, especially 
of such as served the poor; and many, if not all the midwives of note, were 
fled into the country; so that it was next to impossible for a poor woman 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


434 

that could not pay an immoderate price to get any midwife to come to her, 
and if they did, those they could get were generally unskilful and ignorant 
creatures; and the consequence of this was, that a most unusual and incredible 
number of women were reduced to the utmost distress. Some were delivered 
and spoiled by the rashness and ignorance of those who pretended to lay 
them. Children without number were, I might say, murdered by the same, 
but a more justifiable ignorance, pretending they would save the mother, what- 
ever became of the child; and many times both mother and child were lost 
in the same manner; and especially where the mother had the distemper, there 
nobody would come near them, and both sometimes perished. Sometimes the 
mother has died of the plague, and the infant, it may be, half born, or born 
but not parted from the mother. Some died in the very pains of their Wavail, 
and not delivered at all; and so many were the cases of this kind thit it is 
hard to judge of them. ^ 

Something of it will appear in the unusual numbers which are put into the 
weekly bills (though I am far from allowing them to be able to give anything 
of a full account) under the articles of— 

Child-bed. 

Abortive and Still-born. 

Chnsoms and Infants. 


Take the weeks in which the plague was most violent, and compare them 
with the weeks before the distemper began, even in the same year. For

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 43S 

To the disparity of these numbers is to be considered and alloAved for, rfiat, 
according to our usual opinion who were then upon the spot, there were not 
one-third of the people in the town during the months of August and Septem- 
ber as were in the months of January and February. In a word, the usual 
number that used to die of these three articles, and, as I hear, did die of them 
the year before, was thus:—

This inequality, I say, is exceedingly augmented when the numbers of peo- 
ple are considered. I pretend not to make any exact calculation of the numbers 
of people which were at this time in the city, but 1 shall make a probable 
conjecture at that part by-and-by. What I have said now is to explain the 
misery of those poor creatures above, so that it might well be said, as in the 
Scripture, Woe be to those who are with child, and to those which give suck 
in that day. For, indeed, it was a woe to them in particular. 

1 was not conversant in many particular families where these things hap- 
pened, but the outcries of the miserable were heard afar off. As to those who 
were with child, we have seen some calculation made; 291 women dead in 
child-bed in nine weeks, out of one-third part of the number of whom there 
usually died in that time but eighty-four of the same disaster. Let the reader 
calculate the proportion. 

There is no room to doubt but the misery of those that gave suck was in 
proportion as great. Our bills of mortality could give but little light in this, 
yet some it did. There were several more than usual starved at nurse, but 
this was nothing. The misery was where they were, first, starved for want of 
a nurse, the mother dying, and all the family and the infants found dead by 
them, merely for want; and, if I may speak my opinion, I do believe that 
many hundreds of poor helpless infants perished in this manner. Secondly, not 
starved, but poisoned by the nurse. Nay, even where the mother has been 
nurse, and having received the infection, has poisoned, that is, infected the 
infant with her milk, even before they knew they were infected themselves; 
nay, and the infant has died in such a case before the mother. 1 cannot but 
remember to leave this admonition upon record, if ever such another dreadful 
visitation should happen in this city, that all women that are with child or 
that give suck should be gone, if they have any possible means, out of the 
place, because their misery, if infected, will so much exceed all other people’s. 

I could tell here dismal stories of living infants being found sucking the 
breasts of their mothers, or nurses, after they have been dead of the plague. 
Of a mother in the parish where I lived, who, having a child that was not 
well, sent for an apothecary to view the child; and when he came, as the 
relation goes, was giving the child suck at her breast, and to all appearance 
was herself very well; but when the apothecary came close to her he saw 
the tokens upon that breast with which she was suckling the child. He was 



436 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


surprised enough, to be sure, but, not willing to fright the poor woman too 
much, he desired she would give the child into his hand; so he takes the child, 
and going to a cradle in the room, lays it in, and opening its cloths, found 
the tokens upon the child too, and both died before he could get home to 
send a preventive medicine to the father of the child, to whom he had told 
their condition. Whether the child infected the nurse-mother or the mother 
the child was not certain, but the last most likely. Likewise of a child brought 
home to the parents from a nurse that had died of the plague, yet the tender 
mother would not refuse to take in her child, and laid it in her bosom, by 
which she was infected, and died with the child in her arms dead also. 

It would make the hardest heart move at the instances that were frequently 
found of tender mothers tending and watching with their dear chilcycn, and 
even dying before them, and sometimes taking the distemper from ti^cm and 
dying, when the child for whom the affectionate heart had been sacrificed 
has got over it and escaped. 

The like of a tradesman in Fast Smithfield, whose wife was big with child 
of her first child, and fell in labour, having the plague upon her. He could 
neither get midwife to assist her or nurse to tend her, and two servants which 
he kept fled both from her. He ran from house to house like one distracted, but 
could get no help; the utmost he could get was, that a watchman, who attended 
at an infected house shut up, promised to send a nurse in the morning. The 
poor man, wdth his heart broke, went back, assisted his wife what he could, 
acted the part of the midwife, brought the child dead into the world, and 
his wife in about an hour died in his arms, where he held her dead body fast 
till the morning, when the watchman came and brought the nurse as he had 
promised; and coming up the stairs, for he had left the door open, or only 
latched, they found the man sitting with his dead wife in his arms, and so 
overwhelmed with grief that he died in a few hours after, without any sign of 
the infection upon him, but merely sank under the weight of his grief. 

I have heard also of some who, on the death of their relations, have grown 
stupid with the insupportable sorrow, and of one in particular, who was so 
absolutely overcome with the pressure upon his spirits that by degrees his 
head sank into his body, so between his shoulders, that the crown of his head 
was very little seen above the bone of his shoulders, and by degrees, losing 
both voice and sense, his face, looking forward, lay against his collar-bone, 
and could not be kept up any otherwise, unless held up by the hands of other 
people; and the poor man never came to himself again, but languished near a 
year in that condition, and died. Nor was he ever once seen to lift up his 
eyes or to look upon any particular object. 

I cannot undertake to give any other than a summary of such passages as 
these, because it was not possible to come at the particulars, where sometimes 
the whole families where such things happened were carried off by the dis- 
temper. But there were innumerable cases of this kind which presented to the 
eye and the ear, even in passing along the streets, as I have hinted above. Nor 
is it easy to give any story of this or that family which there was not divers 
parallel stories to be met with of the same kind. 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 437 

But as I am now talking of the time when the plague raged at the eastern- 
most part of the town, how for a long time the people of those parts had 
flattered themselves that they should escape, and how they were surprised 
when it came upon them as it did; for, indeed, it came upon them like an 
armed man when it did come;--I say, this brings me back to the three poor 
men who wandered from Wapping, not knowing whither to go or what to 
do, and whom I mentioned before; one a biscuit-baker, one a sail-maker, and 
the other a joiner, all of Wapping or thereabouts. 

The sleepiness and security of that part, as I have observed, was such that 
they not only did not shift for themselves as others did, but they boasted of 
being safe, and of safety being with them; and many people fled out of the 
city, and out of the infected suburbs, to Wapping, Ratcliff, Limehouse, Poplar, 
and such places, as to places of security; and it is not at all unlikely that their 
doing this helped to bring the plague that way faster than it might otherwise 
have come. For though I am much for people flying away, and emptying 
such a town as this, upon the first appearance of a like visitation, and that all 
people who have any possible retreat should make use of it in time, and 
be gone, yet I must say, when all that will fly are gone, those that are left, and 
must stand it, should stand stock-still where they arc, and not shift from one 
end of the town or one part of the town to the other; for that is the bane and 
mischief of the whole, and they carry the plague from house to house in their 
very clothes. 

Wherefore were wc ordered to kill all the dogs and cats, but because as 
they were domestic animals, and arc apt to run from house to house, and 
from street to street, so they are capable of carrying the effluvia or infectious 
steams of bodies infected even in their furs and hair? And therefore it was 
that, in the beginning of the infection, an order was published by the Lord 
Mayor, and by the magistrates, according to the advice of the physicians, 
that all the dogs and cats should be immediately killed, and an officer was 
appointed for the execution. 

It is incredible, if their account is to be depended upon, what a prodigious 
number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they talked of forty thou- 
sand dogs, and five times as many cats, few houses being without a cat, some 
having several, sometimes five or six in a house. All possible endeavours were 
used, also, to destroy the mice and rats, especially the latter, by laying 
ratsbane and other poisons for them, and a prodigious multitude of them were 
also destroyed. 

I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the 
people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them, and how it 
was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well 
public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, 
and that such a prodigious number of people sank in that disaster, which, if 
proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided, 
and which, if posterity think fit, they may take a caution and warning from. 
But I shall come to this part again. 

I come back to my three men. Their story has a moral in every part of it, 



438 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

and their whole conduct, and that of some whom they joined with, is a pat- 
tern for all poor men to follow, or women either, if ever such a time comes 
again; and if there was no other end in recording it, I think this a very just 
one, whether my account be exactly according to fact or no. 

Two of them are said to be brothers, the one an old soldier, but now a 
biscuit-baker; the other a lame sailor, but now a sailmaker; the third a joiner. 
Says John the biscuit-baker one day to Thomas his brother, the sailmaker, 
“Brother Tom, what will become of us? The plague grows hot in the city, 
and increases this way. What shall we do?” 

“Truly,” says Thomas, “I am at a great loss what to do, for I find if it comes 
down into Wapping I shall be turned out of my lodging.” And thus they 
began to talk of it beforehand. \ 

John. Turned out of y6ur lodging, Tom! If you are, I don’t know who 
will take you in, for people are so afraid of one another now, there’s no 
getting a lodging anywhere. 

Thomas. Why, the people where T lodge are good, civil people, ahd have 
kindness enough for me too, but they say I go abroad every day to my work, 
and it will be dangerous, and they talk of locking themselves up and letting 
nobody come near them. 

John. Why, they are in the right, to be sure, if they resolve to venture stay- 
ing in town. 

Thomas. Nay, I might even resolve to stay within doors too, for, except a 
suit of sails that my master has in hand, and which 1 am just finishing, I am 
like to get no more w6rk a great while. There’s no trade stirs now. Workmen 
and servants are turned off everywhere, so that I might be glad to be locked 
up too; but I do not see they will be willing to consent to that, any more 
than to the other. 

John. Why, what will you do then, brother? And what shall I do^^ for I am 
almost as bad as you. The people where I lodge are all gone into the country 
but a maid, and she is to go next week, and to shut the house quite up, so that 
I shall be turned adrift to the wide world before you, and 1 am resolved to 
go away too, if I knew but where to go. 

Thomas. We were both distracted we did not go away at first; then we 
might have travelled anywhere. There’s no stirring now, we shall be starved 
if we pretend to go out of town. They won’t let us have victuals, no, not 
for our money, nor let us come into the towns, much less into their houses. 

John. And that which is almost as bad, I have but little money to help 
myself with neither, 

Thomas. As to that, we might make shift. I have a little, though not much; 
but I tell you there’s no stirring on the road. I know a couple of poor honest 
men in our street have attempted to travel, and at Barnet, or Whetstone, or 
thereabout, the people offered to fire at them if they pretended to go forward, 
so they are come back again quite discouraged. 

John. I would have ventured their fire if I had been there. If I had been 
denied food for my money they should have seen me take it before their 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 439 

faces, and if I had tendered money for it they could not have taken any 
course with me by law. 

T how as. You talk your old soldier’s language, as if you were in the Low 
Countries now, but this is a serious thing. The people have good reason to 
keep anybody off that they arc not satisfied are sound, at such a time as this, 
and we must not plunder them. 

John, No, brother, you mistake the case, and mistake me too. I would 
plunder nobody; but for any town upon the road to deny me leave to pass 
through the town in the open highway, and deny me j)rovisions for my money, 
is to say the town has a right to starve me to death, which cannot be true. 

Thomas, But they do not deny you liberty to go back again from whence 
you came, and therefore they do not starve you. 

John, But the next town behind me will, by the same rule, deny me leave 
to go back, and so they do starve me between them. Besides, there is no law 
to prohibit my travelling wherever 1 will on the road. 

Thomas, But there will be so much difficulty in disputing with them at 
every town on the road that it is not for poor men to do it or undertake it, 
at such a time as this is especially. 

John, Why, brother, our condition at this rate is worse than anybody else’s, 
for we can neither go away nor stay here. I am of the same mind with the 
lepers of Samaria. If we stay here we arc sure to die; I mean especially as you 
and I arc stated, without a dwelling-house ot our own, and without lodging 
in anybody else’s. There is no lying in the street at such a time as this; we 
had as good go into the dead-cart at once. Therefore 1 say, if wc stay here 
we are sure to die, and if we go away wc can but die; I am resolved to be gone. 

Thomas, You will go away. Whither will you go, and what can you do? I 
would as willingly go away as you, if I knew whither. But we have no 
acquaintance, no friends. Here we were born, and here wc must die. 

John, Look you, Tom, the whole kingdom is my native country as well 
as this town. You may as well say I must not go out of my house if it is on 
fire as that I must not go out of the town I was born in when it is infected 
with the plague. 1 was born in England, and have a right to live in it if 1 can. 

Thomas, But you know every vagrant person may, by the laws of England, 
be taken up, and passed back to their last legal settlement. 

John, But how shall they make me a vagrant? I desire only to travel on, 
upon my lawful occasions. 

Thomas, What lawful occasions can we pretend to travel, or rather wander 
upon? They will not be put off with words. 

John, Is not flying to save our lives a lawful occasion^ And do they not all 
know that the fact is true? We cannot be said to dissemble. 

Thomas, But suppose they let us pass, whither shall we go? 

John, Anywhere to save our lives; it is time enough to consider that when 
we are got out of this town. If I am once out of this dreadful place, I care 
not where I go. 

Thomas, We shall be driven to great extremities. I know not what to think 
of it.

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

John, Well, Tom, consider of it a little. 

This was about die beginning of July; and though the plague was come 
forward in the west and north parts of the town, yet all Wapping, as I have 
observed before, and Rcdriff, and Ratcliff, and Limehouse, and Poplar, in 
short, Deptford and Greenwich, all both sides of the river from the Hermitage, 
and from over against it, quite down to Blackwall, was entirely free; there 
had not one person died of the plague in all Stepney parish, and not one on 
the south side of Whitechapel Road, no, not in any parish; and yet the weekly 
bill was that very week risen up to 1006. 

It was a fortnight after this before the two brothers met again, pd then 
the case was a little altered, and the plague was exceedingly advanced and 
the number greatly increased; the bill was up at 2785, and prodigiously increas- 
ing, though still both sides of the river, as below, kept pretty well. But some 
began to die in Rcdriff, and about five or six in Ratcliff Highway, vpen the 
sailmaker came to his brother John express, and in some fright; for \he was 
absolutely warned out of his lodging, and had only a week to provide himself. 
His brother John was in as bad a case, for he was quite out, and had only 
begged leave of his master, the biscuit-baker, to lodge in an out-house belong- 
ing to his work-house, where he only lay upon straw, with some biscuit-sacks, 
or bread-sacks, as they called them, laid upon it, and some of the same sacks 
to cover him. 

Here they resolved, seeing all employment being at an end, and no work 
or wages to be had, they would make the best of their way to get out of the 
reach of the dreadful infection, and, being as good husbands as they could, 
would endeavour to live upon what they had as long as it would last, and then 
work for more, if they could get work anywhere, of any kind, let it be what 
it would. 

While they were considering to put this resolution in practice in the best 
manner they could, the third man, who was acquainted very well with the 
sailmaker, came to know of the design, and got leave to be one of the num- 
ber; and thus they prepared to set out. 

It happened that they had not an equal share of money, but as the sailmaker, 
who had the best stock, was, besides his being lame, the most unfit to expect 
to get anything by working in the country, so he was content that what 
money they had should all go into one public stock, on condition that what- 
ever any one of them could gain more than anotlicr, it should, without any 
grudging, be all added to the public stock. 

They resolved to load themselves with as little baggage as possible, because 
they resolved at first to travel on foot, and to go a great way, that they might, 
if possible, be effectually safe; and a great many consultations they had with 
themselves before they could agree about what way they should travel, which 
they were so far from adjusting that even to the morning they set out they 
were not resolved on it. 

At last the seaman put in a hint that determined it. “First,’’ says he, “the 
weather is very hot, and therefore 1 am for travelling north, that we may not 
have the sun upon our faces and beating on our breasts, which will heat and 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 441 

suffocate us; and I have been told,” says he, “that it is not good to overheat 
our blood at a time when, for aught we know, the infection may be in the 
very air. In the next place,” says he, “I am for going the way that may be 
contrary to the wind, as it may blow when we set out, that we may not have 
the wind blow the air of the city on our backs as we go,” These two cautions 
were approved of, if it could be brought so to hit that the wind might not be 
in the south when they set out to go north. 

John the baker, who had been a soldier,* then put in his opinion. “First,” 
says he, “we none of us expect to get any lodging on the road, and it will 
be a little too hard to lie just in the open air. Though it be warm weather, yet 
it may be wet and damp, and we have a double reason to take care of our 
healths at such a time as this; and therefore,” says he, “you, brother Tom, that 
are a sailmakcr, might easily make us a little tent, and I will undertake to 
set it up every night, and take it down, and a fig for all the inns in England; 
if we have a good tent over our heads we shall do well enough.” 

The joiner opposed this, and told them, let them leave that to him; he 
would undertake to build them a house every night with his hatchet and 
mallet, though he had no other tools, which should be fully to their satisfaction, 
and as good as a tent. 

The soldier and the joiner disputed that point some time, but at last the 
soldier carried it for a tent. The only objection against it was, that it must 
be carried with them, and that would increase their baggage too much, the 
weather being hot; but the sailmakcr had a piece of good hap fell in which 
made that easy, for his master whom he worked for, having a rope-walk as 
well as sailmaking trade, had a little, poor horse that he made no use of then, 
and being willing to assist the three honest men, he gave them the horse for 
the carrying their baggage; also for a small matter of three days’ work that his 
man did for him before he went, he let him have an old top-gallant sail 
that was worn out, but was sufficient and more than enough to make a very 
good tent. The soldier showed how to shape it, and they soon by his direc- 
tion made their tent, and fitted it with poles or staves for the purpose; and 
thus they were furnished for their journey, viz., three men, one tent, one horse, 
one gun, for the soldier would not go without arms, for now he said he was 
no more a biscuit-baker, but a trooper. 

The joiner had a small bag of tools, such as might be useful if he should 
get any work abroad, as well for their subsistence as his own. What money 
they had they brought all into one public stock, and thus they began their 
journey. It seems that in the morning when they set out the wind blew, as 
the sailor said, by his pocket-compass, at N.W. by W. So they directed, or 
rather resolved to direct, their course N.W. 

But then a difficulty came in their way, that, as they set out from the 
hither end of Wapping, near the Hermitage, and that the plague was now 
very violent, especially on the north side of the city, as in Shoreditch and 
Cripplegatc parish, they did not think it safe for them to go near those parts; 
so they went away cast through Ratcliff Highway as far as Ratcliff Cross, 
and leaving Stepney Church still on their left hand, being afraid to come up 



442 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

from Ratcliff Cross to Mile End, because they must come just by the church- 
yard, and because the wind, that seemed to blow more from the west, blew 
directly from the side of the city where the plague was hottest. So I say, 
leaving Stepney, they fetched a long compass, and going to Poplar and Brom- 
ley, came into the great road just at Bow. 

Here the watch placed upon Bow Bridge would have questioned them, but 
they, crossing the road into a narrow way that turns out of the hither end 
of the town of Bow to Old Ford, avoided any inquiry there, and travelled 
to Old Ford. The constables everywhere were upon their guard, not so much, 
it seems, to stop people passing by as to stop them from taking, up their 
abode in their towns, and withal because of a report that was neyly raised 
at that time, and that, indeed, was not very improbable, viz., thatlthe poor 
people in London, being distressed and starved for want of worki and by 
that means for want of bread, wxre up in arms and had raised a tumult, and 
that they would come out to all the towns round to plunder for bre^d. This, 
I say, was only a rumour, and it was very well it was no more. Bu^ it was 
not so far off from being a reality as it has been thought, for in a few weeks 
more the poor people became so desperate by the calamity they suffered that 
they were with great difficulty kept from running out into the fields and 
towns, and tearing all in pieces wherever they came; and, as I have observed 
before, nothing hindered them but that the plague raged so violently, and fell 
in upon them so furiously, that they rather went to the grave by thousands 
than into the fields in mobs by thousands, for, in the parts about the parishes 
of St. Sepulchre, Clerkenwell, Cripplegatc, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch* which 
were the places where the mob began to threaten, the distemper came on so 
furiously that there died in those few parishes even then, before the plague 
was come to its height, no less than 5361 people in the first three weeks in 
August, when, at the same time, the parts about Wapping, Ratcliff, and Rother- 
hithe were, as before described, hardly touched, or but very lightly; so that, 
in a word, though, as I said before, the good management of the Lord Mayor 
and justices did much to prevent the rage and desperation of the people from 
breaking out in rabbles and tumults, and, in short, from the poor plundering 
the rich,— I say, though they did much, the dead-carts did more, for as 1 
have said that in five parishes only there died about 5000 in twenty days, 
so there might be probably three times that number sick all that time, for 
some recovered, and great numbers fell sick every day and died afterwards. 
Besides, I must still be allowed to say that if the bills of mortality said five 
thousand, I always believed it was near twice as many in reality, there being 
no room to believe that the account they gave was right, or that, indeed, they 
were, among such confusions as I saw them in,*“in any condition to keep an 
exact account. 

But to return to my travellers. Here they were only examined, and as they 
seemed rather coming from the country than from the city, they fourid the 
people the easier with them; that they talked to them, let them come into a 
public-house where the constable and his warders were, and gave them drink 
and some victuals, which greatly refreshed and encouraged them; and here 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 443 

it came into their heads to say, when they should be inquired of aftetwards* 
not that they came from London, but that they came out of Essex. 

To forward this little fraud, they obtained so much favour of the constable 
at Old Ford as to give them a certificate of their passing from Essex throi^h 
that village, and that they had not been at London, which, though false in^e 
common acceptation of London in the county, yet was literally true, Wrap- 
ping or Ratcliff being no part either of the city or liberty. 

This certificate directed to the next constable that was at Homerton, one 
of the hamlets of the parish of Hackney, was so serviceable to them that it 
procured them, not a free passage there only, but a full certificate of health 
from a justice of the peace, who, upon the constable’s application, granted 
it without much difficulty; and thus they passed through the long divided 
town of Hackney (for it lay then in several separated hamlets), and travelled 
on till they came into the great north road on the top of Stamford Hill. 

By this time they began to be weary, and so in the back-road from Hackney, 
a little before it opened into the said great road, they resolved to set up their 
tent and encamp for the first night, which they did accordingly, with this 
addition, that finding a barn, or a building like a barn, and first searching as 
well as they could to be sure there was nobody in it, they set up their tent, 
with the head of it against the barn. This they did also because the wind blew 
that night very high, and they were but young at such a way of lodging, as 
well as at the managing their tent. 

Here they went to sleep; but the joiner, a grave and sober man, and not 
pleased with their lying at this loose rate the first night, could not sleep, and 
resolved, after trying to sleep to no purpose, that he would get out, and, 
taking the gun in his hand, stand sentinel and guard his companions. So, with 
the gun in his hand, he walked to and again before the barn, for that stood 
in the field near the road, but within the hedge. He had not been long upon 
the scout but he heard a noise of people coming on, as if it had been a great 
number, and they came on, as he thought, directly towards the barn. He did 
not presently awake his companions, but in a few minutes more, their noise 
growing louder and louder, the biscuit-baker called to him and asked him 
what was the matter, and quickly started out too. The other, being the lame 
sailmaker and most weary, lay still in the tent. 

As they expected, so the people whom they had heard came on directly 
to the barn, when one of our travellers challenged, like soldiers upon the 
guard, with “Who comes there?” The people did not answer immediately, 
but one of them speaking to another that was behind him, “Alas! alas! we 
are all disappointed,” says he. “Here are some people before us; the barn is 
taken up.” 

They all stopped upon that, as under some surprise, and it seems there 
was about thirteen of them in all, and some women among them. They con- 
sulted together what they should do, and by their discourse our travellers soon 
found they were poor, distressed people too, like themselves, seeking shelter and 
safety; and besides, our travellers had no need to be afraid of meir commff 
up to disturb them, for as soon as they heard the words, “Who comes there? * 



444 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


these could hear the women say, as if frighted, “Do not go near them. How 
do you know but they may have the plague?” And when one of the men 
said, “Let us but speak to them,” the women said, “No, don’t by any means. 
We have escaped thus far by the goodness of God; do not let us run into 
danger now, we beseech you.” 

Our travellers found by this that they were a good, sober sort of people, 
and flying for their lives, as they were; and, as they were encouraged by it, 
so John said to the joiner, his comrade, “Let us encourage them too as much 
as we can;” so he called to them, “Hark ye, good people,” says the joiner, 
“we find by your talk that you are flying from the same dreadful epemy as 
we are. Do not be afraid of us; we are only three poor men of u4. If you 
are free from the distemper you shall not be hurt by us. We arc not in 
the barn, but in a little tent here in the outside, and we will remove l|or you; 
we can set up our tent again immediately anywhere else;” and upoi^ this a 
parley began between the joiner, whose name was Richard, and one ^f their 
men, who said his name was Ford. 

Ford. And do you assure us that you are all sound men? 

Richard. Nay, we are concerned to tell you of it, that you may not be 
uneasy or think yourselves in danger; but you see wc do not desire you should 
put yourselves into any danger, and therefore I tell you that we have not 
made use of the barn, so we will remove from it, that you may be safe and 
wc also. 

Ford. That is very kind and charitable; but if we have reason to be satisfied 
that you arc sound and free from the visitation, why should we make you 
remove now you are settled in your lodging, and, it may be, are laid down 
to rest? We will go into the barn, if you please, to rest ourselves a while, 
and we need not disturb you. 

Richard. Well, but you are more than we are. I hope you will assure us 
that you are all of you sound too, for the danger is as great from you to us 
as from us to you. 

Ford. Blessed be God that some do escape, though it is but few; what 
may be our portion still we know not, but hitherto we arc preserved. 

Richard. What part of the town do you come from? Was the plague come 
to the places where you lived? 

Ford. Ay, ay, in a most frightful and terrible manner, or else we had not 
fled away as wc do; but wc believe there will be very few left alive behind us. 

Richard. What part do you come from? 

Ford. We are most of us of Cnpplegate parish, only two or three of Clerk- 
enwell parish, but on the hither side. 

Richard. How then was it that you came away no sooner? 

Ford. We have been away some time, and kept together as well as wc 
could at the hither end of Islington, where we got leave to lie in an old 
uninhabited house, and had some bedding and conveniences of our own that 
we brought with us; but the plague is come up into Islington too, and a house 
next door to our poor dwelling was infected and shut up, and we are come 
away in a fright. 



445 


A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

Richard. And what way are you going? 

Ford. As our lot shall cast us; we know not whither, but God will guide 
those that look up to Him. 

They parleyed no further at that time, but came all up to the barn, and 
with some difficulty got into it. There was nothing but hay in the barn, but 
it was almost full of that, and they accommodated themselves as well as they 
could, and went to rest; but our travellers observed that before they went to 
sleep an ancient man, who, it seems, was father of one of the women, went 
to prayer with all the company, recommending themselves to the blessing and 
direction of Providence, before they went to sleep. 

It was soon day at that time of the year, and as Richard the joiner had kept 
guard the first part of the night, so John the soldier relieved him, and he 
had the post in the morning, and they began to he acquainted with one 
another. It seems when they left Islington they intended to have gone north, 
away to Highgate, but were stopped at Holloway, and there they would not 
let them pass; so they crossed over the fields and hills to the eastward, and 
came out at the Boarded River, and so avoiding the towns, they left Hornsey 
on the left hand and Newington on the right hand, and came into the great 
road about Stamford Hill on that side, as the three travellers had done on 
the other side. And now they had thoughts of going over the river in the 
marshes, and make forwards to Epping Forest, where they hoped they should 
pet leave to rest. It seems they were not poor, at leavSt not so poor as to be 
in want; at least they had enough to subsist them moderately for two or three 
months, when, as they said, they were in hopes the cold weather would check 
the infection, or at least the violence of it would have spent itself, and would 
abate, if it were only for want of people left alive to be infected. 

This was much the fate of our three travellers, only that they seemed to 
be the better furnished for travelling, and had it in their view to go farther 
off; for as to the first, they did not propose to go farther than one day’s 
journey, that so they might have intelligence every two or three days how 
things were at London. 

But here our travellers found themselves under an unexpected inconvenience, 
namely, that of their horse, for by means of the horse to carry their baggage 
they were obliged to keep in the road, whereas the people of this other band 
went over the fields or roads, path or no path, way or no way, as they 
pleased; neither had they any occasion to pass through any town, or come near 
any town, other than to buy such things as they wanted for their necessary 
subsistence, and in that indeed they were put to much difficulty; of which 
in its place. 

But our three travellers were obliged to keep tlie road, or else they must 
commit spoil, and do the country a great deal of damage in breaking down 
fences and gates to go over enclosed fields, which they were loath to do if 
they could help it. 

Our three travellers, however, had a great mind to join themselves to this 
company and take their lot with them; and after some discourse they laid 
aside their first design which looked northward, and resolved to follow the 



446 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

other into Essex; so in the morning they took up their tent and loaded their 
horse, and away they travelled all together. 

They had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the river-side, the ferry- 
man being afraid of them; but after some parley at a distance, the ferryman 
was content to bring his boat to a place distant from the usual ferry, and 
leave it there for them to take it; so putting themselves over, he directed 
them to leave the boat, and he, having another boat, said he would fetch it 
again, which it seems, however, he did not do for above eight days. 

Here giving the ferryman money beforehand, they had a supply of victuals 
and drink, which he brought and left in the boat for them, but not ^ithout, 
as I said, having received the money beforehand. But now our travellers were 
at a great loss and difficulty how to get the horse over, the boat beinW small 
and not fit for it, and at last could not do it without unloading the baggage 
and making him swim over. \ 

From the river they travelled towards the forest, but when they catne to 
Walthamstow the people of that town denied to admit them, as was th6 case 
everywhere. The constables and their watchmen kept them off at a distance 
and parleyed with them. They gave the same account of themselves as before, 
but these gave no credit to what they said, giving it for a reason that two 
or three companies had already come that way and made the like pretences, 
but that they had given several people the distemper in the towns where they 
had passed, and had been afterwards so hardly used by the country, though 
with justice too, as they had deserved, that about Brentwood, or that way, 
several of them perished in the fields, whether of the plague or of mere want 
and distress they could not tell. 

This was a good reason indeed why the people of Walthamstow should be 
very cautious, and why they should resolve not to entertain anybody that 
they were not well satisfied of. But, as Richard the joiner and one of the 
other men who parleyed with them told them, it was no reason why they 
should block up the roads and refuse to let people pass through the town, and 
who asked nothing of them but to go through the street; that if their people 
were afraid of them, they might go into their houses and shut their doors; 
they would neither show them civility nor incivility, but go on about their 
business. 

The constables and attendants, not to be persuaded by reason, continued 
obstinate, and would hearken to nothing, so the two men that talked with 
them went back to their fellows to consult what was to be done. It was very 
discouraging in the whole, and thejr knew not what to do for a good while, 
but at last John the soldier and biscuit-baker, considering a while, “Come,” 
says he, “leave the rest of the parley to me.” He had not appeared yet, so 
he sets the joiner, Richard, to work to cut some poles out of the trees and 
shape them as like guns as he could, and in a little time he had five or six fair 
muskets, which at a distance would not be known* and about the part where 
the lock of a gun is he caused them to wrap cloth and rags such as they had, 
as soldiers do in wet weather to preserve the locki» of their pieces from rust; 
die rest was discoloured with clay or mud, such as they could get; and al^

this while the rest of them sat under the trees by his direction, in two or 
three bodies, where they made fires at a good distance from one another. 

While this was doing he advanced himself and two or three with him, and 
set up their tent in the lane within sight of the barrier which the town’s men had 
made, and set a sentinel just by it with the real gun, the only one they had, 
and who walked to and fro with the gun on his shoulder, so as that the people 
of the town might see them. Also, he tied the horse to a gate in the hedge 
just by, and got some dry sticks together and kindled a fire on the other side of 
thd tent, so that the people of the town could see the fire and the smoke, but 
could not sec what they were doing at it. 

After the country people had looked upon them very earnestly a great 
while, and, by all that they could see, could not but suppose that they were 
a great many in company, they began to be uneasy, not for their going away, 
but for staying where they were, and above all, perceiving they had horses 
and arms, for they had seen one horse and one gun at the tent, and they 
had seen others of them walk about the field on the inside of the hedge by 
the side of the lane with their muskets, as they took them to be, shouldered; 

1 say, upon such a sight as this, you may be assured they were alarmed and 
terribly frighted, and it seems they went to a justice of the peace to know 
what they should do. What the justice advised them to I know not, but 
towards the evening they called from the barrier, as above, to the sentinel 
at the tent, 

“What do you want?” says John.^ 

“Why, what do you intend to do?” says the constable. 

“To do,” says John; “what would you have us to do?” 

Constable, Why don’t you be gone? What do you stay there for? 

John, Why do you stop us on the king’s highway, and pretend to refuse 
us leave to go on our way? 

Constable, We are not bound to tell you our reason, though we did let you 
know it was because of the plague. 

John, We told you we were all sound and free from the plague, which we 
were not bound to have satisfied you of, and yet you pretend to stop us on 
the highway. 

Constable, We have a right to stop it up, and our own safety obliges us to it. 
Besides, this is not the king’s highway; ’tis a way upon sufferance. You see here 
is a gate, and if we do let people pass here, we make them pay toll. 

John, We have a right to seek our own safety as well as you, and you may 
sec we are flying for our lives, and ’tis very unchristian and unjust to stop us. 

Constable, You may go back from whence you came; we do not hinder you 

from that. j * t 

John, No; it is a stronger enemy than you that keeps us from doing mat, or 

else we should not have come hither. 

Constable, Well, you may go any other way, then. 

Ht seems John was in the tent, but hearing them call, he steps out, and taking 
the gun upon his shoulder, talked to them as if he had been the sentinel placed 
there upon the guard by some officer that was his superior.

John. No, no; I sujppose you see we are able to send you going, and all the 
people of your parish, and come through your town when we will; but since 
you have stopped us here, we are content. You see we have encamped here, and 
here we will five. We hope you will furnish us with victuals. 

Constable, We furnish you! What mean you by that^ 

John, Why, you would not have us starve, would you? If you stop us here, 
you must keep us. 

Constable, You will be ill kept at our maintenance. 

John, If you stint us, we shall make ourselves the better allowance. 

Constable, Why, you will not pretend to quarter upon us by force, wpl you? 

John, We have offered no violence to you yet. Why do you seem to oblige 
us to it? I am an old soldier, and cannot starve, and if you think that we shall 
be obliged to go back for want of provisions, you are mistaken. \ 

Constable, Since you threaten us, we shall take care to be strong enough for 
you. I have orders to raise the county upon you. \ 

John, It is you that threaten, not we. And since you are for mischief, you 
cannot blame us if we do not give you time for it; we shall begin our march 
in a few minutes.^ 

Constable, What is it you demand of us? 

John, At first we desired nothing of you but leave to go through the town; 
we should have offered no injury to any of you, neither would you have had 
any injury or loss by us. We are not thieves, but poor people in distress, and 
flying from the dreadful plague in London, which devours thousands ^very 
week. We wonder how you could be so unmerciful! 

Constable, Self-preservation obliges us. 

John, What’ To shut up your compassion in a case of such distress as this^ 

Constable, Well, if you will pass over the fields on your left hand, and behind 
that part of the town, I will endeavour to have gates opened for you. 

John, Our horsemen^ cannot pass with our baggage that way; it does not lead 
into the road that we want to go, and why should you force us out of the 
road? Besides, you have kept us here all day without any provisions but such 
as we brought with us. I think you ought to send us some provisions for our 
relief. 

Constable, If you will go another way we will send you some provisions. 

John, That is the way to have all the towns in the county stop up the ways 
against us. 

Constable, If they all furnish you with food, what will you be the worse? 
I see you have tents; you want no lodging. 

John. Well, what quantity of provisions will yotrsend us? 

Constable, How many are you? 

John, Nay, we do not ask enough for all our company; we are in three 
companies. If you will send us bread for twenty men and about six or seven

women for three days, and show us the way over the field you speak of, we 
desire not to put your people into any fear for us; we will go out of our way 
to oblige you, though we are as free from infection as you are.« 

Constable » And will you assure us that your other people shall offer us no 
new disturbance? 

John, No, no, you may depend on it 

Constable, You must oblige yourself, too, that none of your people shall 
come a step nearer than where the provisions we send you shall be set down. 

John, I answer for it we will not 

Accordingly they sent to the place twenty loaves of bread and three or four 
large pieces of good beef, and opened some gates, through which they passed; 
but none of them had courage so much as to look out to see them go, and, as 
it was evening, if they had looked they could not have seen them so as to know 
how few they were. 

This was John the soldier’s management But this gave such an alarm to the 
county, that had they really been two or three hundred the whole county 
would have been raised upon them, and they would have been sent to prison, 
or perhaps knocked on the head. 

They were soon made sensible of this, for two days afterwards they found 
several parties of horsemen and footmen also about, in pursuit of three com- 
panies of men, armed, as they said, with muskets, who were broke out from 
London, and had the plague upon them, and that were not only spreading the 
distemper among the people, but plundering the country. 

As they saw now the consequence of their case, they soon saw the danger 
they were in, so they resolved, by the advice also of the old soldier, to divide 
themselves again. John and his two comrades, with the horse, went away as if 
towards Waltham; the other in two companies, but all a little asunder, and 
went towards Epping. 

The first night they encamped all in the forest, and not far off of one an- 
other, but not setting up the tent, lest that should discover them. On the other 
hand, Richard went to work with his axe and his hatchet, and cutting down 
branches of trees, he built three tents or hovels, in which they all encamped 
with as much convenience as they could expect. 

The provisions they had at Walthamstow served them very plentifully this 
night; and as for the next, they left it to Providence. They had fared so well 
with the old soldier’s conduct that they now willingly made him their leader, 
and the first of his conduct appeared to be very good. He told them that they 
were now at a proper distance enough from London; that as they need not be 
immediately beholden to the country for relief, so they ought to be as careful 
the country did not infect them as that they did not infect the country; that 
what little money they had, they must be as frugal of as they could; that as 
he would not have them think of offering the country any violence, so they 

*Hcre he called to one of his men, and bade him order Captain Richard and 
his people to march the lower way on the side of the marches, and meet them in 
the West; which was all a sham, for they had no Captain Richard, or any sudi 
company. 



450 WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

must endeavour to make the sense of their condition go as far with the country 
as it could. They all referred themselves to his direction, so they left their three 
houses standing, and the next day went away toward^ Epping. The captain 
also, for so they now called him, and his two fellow-travellers laid aside their 
design of going to Waltham, and all went together. 

When they came near Epping they halted, choosing out a proper place in 
the open forest, not very near the highway, but not far out of it on the north 
side, under a little cluster of low pollard-trees. Here they pitched their little 
camp, which consisted of three large tents or huts made of poles, which their 
carpenter, and such as were his assistants, cut down and fixed in tht ground 
in a circle, binding all the small ends together at the top, and thickening the 
sides with boughs of trees and bushes, so that they were completely close and 
warm. They had, besides this, a little tent, where the women lay Iw them- 
selves, and a hut to put the horse in. 

It iWpened that the next day, or next but one, was market-dsly at Epping, 
when Captain John and one of the other men went to market and bought some 
provisions; that is to say, bread, and some mutton and beef; and two of the 
women went separately, as if they had not belonged to the rest, and bought 
more. John took the horse to bring it home, and the sack which the carpenter 
carried his tools in to put it in. The carpenter went to work and made them 
benches and stools to sit on, such as the wood he could get would afford, and 
a kind of table to dine on. 

They were taken no notice of for two or three days, but after that abun- 
dance of people ran out of the town to look at them, and all the coundy was 
alarmed about them. The people at first seemed afraid to come near them; and, 
on the other hand, they desired the people to keep off, for there was a rumour 
that the plague was at Waltham, and that it had been in Epping two or three 
days; so John called out to them not to come to them, “for,” says he, ‘Sve are 
all whole and sound people here, and we would not have you bring the plague 
among us, nor pretend we brought it among you.” 

After this the parish officers came up to them and parleyed with them at a 
distance, and desired to know who they were, and by what authority they pre- 
tended to fix their stand at that place, John answered very frankly, they were 
poor distressed people from London, who, foreseeing the misery they should 
1^ reduced to if the plague spread into the city, had fled out in time for their 
lives, and, having no acquaintance or relations to fly to, had first taken up at 
Islhl^on, but, the plague being come into that town, were fled farther; and as 
they supposed diat the people of Epping might have refused them coming into 
thcrr town, they had pitched their tents thus in th^open field and in the forest, 
being willing to bear all the hardships of such a disconsolate lodging rather 
than have any one think or be afraid that they should receive injury by them. 

At first the Epping people talked roughly to them, and told them they must 
remove; that this was no place for them; and that they pretended to be sound 
and weH, but that they might be infected with the plague for aught they knew, 
and m%ht infect the whole country, and they could not suffer them there* 

John argued very calmly with tnem a great while, and told them that Lon*

dpn was the place by which they, that is, the townsmen of Epptng and all the 
country found them, subsisted; to whom they sold the produce m their lands^ 
and out of whom they made their rent of their farms, and to be so cruei to the 
inhabitants of London, or to any of those by whom they gained so mueh, was 
very hard, and they would be loth to have it remembered hereafter, and have 
it told how barbarous, how inhospitable, and how unkind they were to the 
people of London when they fled from the face of the most terrible enemy 
m the world; that it would be enough to make the name of an Epping man 
hateful through all the city, and to have the rabble stone them in the very 
streets whenever they came so much as to market; that they were not yet 
secure from being visited themselves, and that, as he heard, Waltham was 
already; that they would think it very hard that when any of them fled for 
fear before they were touched, they should be denied the liberty of lying so 
much as in the open fields. 

The Epping men told them again that they, indeed, said they were sound 
and free from the infection, but that they had no assurance of it; and that it 
was reported that there had been a great rabble of people at Walthamstow, 
who made such pretences of being sound as they did, but that they threatened 
to plunder the town and force their way, whether the parish officers would 
or no; that there were near two hundred of them, and had arms and tents like 
Low Country soldiers; that they extorted provisions from the town, by threat- 
ening them with living upon them at free quarter, showing their arms, and 
talking in the language of soldiers; and that several of them being gone away 
towards Romford and Brentwood, the country had been infected by them, and 
the plague spread into both those large towns, so that the people durst not 
go to market there as usual; that it was very likely they were some of that 
party; and if so, they deserved to be sent to the county jail, and be secured 
till they had made satisfacaon for the damage they had done, and for the 
terror and fright they had put the country mto. 

John answered that what other people had done was nothing to them; tfaat 
they assured them they were all of one company; that they had never been 
more in number than they saw them at that time (which, bjr the way, was very 
true); that they came out in two separate companies, but joined by the way>, 
their cases being the same, that they were ready to give what account of them- 
selves anybody could desire of them and to give in their names and places of 
abode, that so they might be called to an account for any disorder that tl^y 
might be guilty of; that the townsmen might see they were content to live 
hardly, and only desired a little room to breathe in on the forest where it w^ 
wholesome; for where it was not they could not stay, and would decamp if 
they found it otherwise there. 

“But,” said the townsmen, “we have a great charge of poor upon our hmm 
already, and we must take care not to increase it; we suppose you <can give 
us no security against your being chargeable to our parish and to the 
ants, any more man you can of being oangerous to us as to die mfectionf 

“Why, look you,” says John, “as to being chargeable to you, we Wbpe wt^ 
shall not. If you will relieve us with provisions for our present necessity, we

WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

will be very thankful; as we all lived without charity when we were at home, 
so we will obligee ourselves fully to repay you, if God please to bring us back 
to our own families and houses in safety, and to restore health to the people of 
London. 

“As to our dying here, we assure you, if any of us die, we that survive will 
bury them, and put you to no expense, except it should be that we should 
all die, and then, indeed, the last man not being able to bury himself, would 
put you to that single expense, which, I am persuaded,” says John, “he would 
leave enough behind him to pay you for the expense of. 

“On the other hand,” says John, “if you will shut up all bowels ofj compas- 
sion, and not relieve us at all, we shall not extort anything by violence or steal 
from any one; but when what little we have is spent, if we perish ror want, 
God’s will be done.” \ 

John wrought so upon the townsmen, by talking thus ratioraUy and 
smoothly to them, that they went away; and though they did not give any 
consent to their staying there, yet they did not molest them; and the poor 
people continued there three or four days longer without any disturbance. In 
this time they had got some remote acquaintance with a victualling-house at 
the outskirts of the town, to whom they called at a distance to bring some little 
things that they wanted, and which they caused to be set down at a distance, 
and always paid for very honestly. 

During this time the younger people of the town came frequently pretty 
near them, and would stand and look at them, and sometimes talk with them 
at some space between; and particularly it was observed that the first Sabbath- 
day the poor people kept retired, worshipped God together, and were heard 
to sing psalms. 

These things, and a quiet, inoffensive behaviour, began to get them the good 
opinion of the country, and people began to pity them and speak very well 
of them; the consequence of which was, that upon the occasion of a very wet, 
rainy night, a certain gentleman who lived in the neighbourhood sent them a 
little cart with twelve trusses or bundles of straw, as well for them to lodge 
upon as to cover and thatch their huts and to keep them dry. The minister 
of a parish not far off, not knowing of the other, sent them also about two 
bushels of wheat and half a bushel of white peas. 

They were very thankful, to be sure, for this relief, and particularly the 
straw was a very great comfort to them; for though the ingenious carpenter 
had made frames for them to lie in like troughs, and filled them with leaves of 
trees, and such things as they could get, and had cut all their tent-cloth out 
to make them coveriids, yet they lay damp, andjiard, and unwholesome till 
this straw came, which was to them like feather-beds, and, as John said, more 
welcome than feather-beds would have been at another time. 

This gentleman and the minister having thus begun, and given an example 
of charity to these wanderers, others quickly followed, and they received 
every day some benevolence or other from the people, but chiefly from the 
gendemen who dwelt in the country round about. Some sent them chairs, 
stools, tables, and such household things as diey gave notice they wanted; some 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 4S3 

sent them blankets, ru^, and coverhds, some earthenware, and some kitchen^ 
ware for ordering their food. 

Encouraged by this good usage, their carpenter in a few days built them 
a large shed or house with rafters, and a roof in form, and an upper floor, in 
which they lodged warm, for the weather began to be damp and cold in the 
beginning of September. But this house, being very well thatched, and riie 
sides and roof made very thick, kept out the cold well enough. He made, also, 
an earthen wall at one end with a chimney in it, and another of the company, 
with a vast deal of trouble and pains, made a funnel to the chimney to carry 
out the smoke. 

Here they lived comfortably, though coarsely, till the beginning of Septem- 
ber, when they had the bad news to hear, whether true or not, that the plague, 
which was very hot at Waltham Abbey on one side, and at Romford and 
Brentwood on the other side, was also come to Epping, to Woodford, and to 
most of the towns upon the Forest, and which, as they said, was brought down 
among them chiefly by the higglers, and such people as went to and from 
London with provisions. 

If this was true, it was an evident contradiction to that report which was 
afterwards spread all over England, but which, as I have said, I cannot confirm 
of my own knowledge, namely, that the market-people carrying provisions to 
the city never got the infection, or carried it back into the country, both 
which, I have been assured, has been false. 

It nndght be that they were preserved even beyond expectation, though not 
to a miracle, that abundance went and came and were not touched, and that 
was much for the encouragement of the poor people of London, who had been 
completely miserable if the people that brought provisions to the markets had 
not been many times wonderfully preserved, or at least more preserved than 
could be reasonably expected. 

But now these new inmates began to be disturbed more effectually, for the 
towns about them were really infected, and they began to be afraid to trui^ 
one another so much as to go abroad for such things as they wanted, and this 
pinched them very hard, for now they had little or nothing but what the chari- 
table gentlemen of the country supplied them with. But, for their encourage- 
ment, it happened that other gentlemen in the country, who had not sent them 
anything before, began to hear of them and supply them, and one sent them 
a large pig, that is to say, a porker, another two sheep, and another sent them 
a calf. In short, they had meat enough, and sometimes had cheese and milk, 
and all such things. They were chiefly put to it for bread, for when the gentle- 
men sent them com they had nowhere to bake it or to grind it. This made 
them eat the first two bushel of wheat that was sent them in parched com, as 
the Israelites of old did, without grinding or making bread ot it. 

At last they found means to carry their corn to a windmill near Woodford, 
where they had it ground, and afterwards the biscuit-baker made a hearth so 
hollow and dry that he could bake biscuit-cakes tolerably well; and thus they 
came into a condition to live without any assistance or supplies from 
towns; and it was well they did, for the country was soon after fully infected. 



m WORKS OF DAMflL DEPOfe 

iiidi about 120 wete said to have died of the distemper in the villages near them, 
which was a terrible thing to them. 

On this they called a new council, and now the towns had no need to be 
afraid they should settle near them; but, on the contrary, several families of the 
poorer sort of the inhabitants quitted their houses and built huts in the forest 
afmr the same manner as they had done. But it was observed that several of 
diese poor people that had so removed had the sickness even in their huts or 
booths; the reason of which was plain, namely, not because they removed into 
the air, but, (i) because they did not remove time enough; that is to say, not 
till, by openly conversing with the other people their neighbours, they had 
die distemper upon them, or (as may be said) among them, and so carried it 
about them whither they went. Or (2) because they were not careful enough, 
after they were safely removed out of the towns, not to come in a^in and 
mingle with the diseased people. 

But be it which of these it will, when our travellers began to perceiVe that 
the plague was not only in the towns, but even in the tents and huts m the 
forest near them, they began then not only to be afraid, but to think of de- 
camping and removing; for had they stayed they would have been in manifest 
danger of their lives. 

It is not to be wondered that they were greatly afflicted at being obliged 
to quit the place where they had been so kindly received, and where they 
had been treated with so much humanity and charity; but necessity and the 
hazard of life, which they came out so far to preserve, prevailed with them, 
and they saw no remedy. John, however, thought of a remedy for their present 
misfortune, namely, that he would first acquaint that gentleman who was their 
principal benefactor with the distress they were in, and to crave his assistance 
and advice. 

The good, charitable gentleman encouraged them to quit the place, for fear 
Aey should be cut off from any retreat at all by the violence of the distemper; 
but whither they should go, that he found very hard to direct them to. At last 
John asked of him whether he, being a justice of the peace, would give them 
certificates of health to other justices whom they might come before, that so, 
whatever might be their lot, Aey might not be repulsed now they had been 
also so long from London. This his worship immediately granted, and gave 
them proper letters of health, and from thence they were at liberty to travel 
whither they pleased. 

Accordingly they had a full certificate of health, intimating that they had 
resided in a village in the county of Essex so long that, being examined and 
scrutinised sufficiently, and having been retired from all conversation for above 
forty days, without any appearance of sickness, they were therefore certainly 
concluded to be sound men, and mi^ht be safely entertained anywhere, having 
at last removed rather for fear of the plague, which was come into such a 
town, rather than for havii^ any signal of infection upon them, or upon any 
bdotlgiii^ to them. 

With this certificate they removed, though with great reluctance; and John 



A JOIJRNAI. OF THE HA<kJ£ YEAA 

incUn^ ^ to go far from home, Aey moved towards the marshes on the 
Side of vf althaiB, But here thejr found a man who, it seems, kept a wear or 
stop upon Ae river, made to raise the water for the barges whicn go up and 
down the river, and he terrified them with dismal stories of the sickn^ IwviM 
been spread into all the towns on the river, and near the river, on the side of 
Middlesex and Hertfordshire; that is to sajr, into Waltham, Waltham Cross, 
Enfield, and Ware, and all the towns on the road, that they were afraid to go 
that way, though it seems the man imposed upon them, for that the thing xm 
not really true. 

However, it terrified them, and they resolved to move across die forest 
towards Romford and Brentwood; but they heard that there were numbers 
of people fled out of London that way, who lay up and down in the forest 
called Hainault Forest, reaching near Romford, and who, having no subsistence 
or habitation, not only lived oddly and suffered great extremities in the woods 
and fields for want of relief, but were said to be made so desperate by those 
extremities as that they offered many violences to the county, robbed and 
plundered, and killed cattle, and the like; that others, building huts and hovels 
by the roadside, begged, and that with an importunity next door to demanding 
relief; so that the county was very uneasy, and had been obliged to take some 
of them up. 

This, in the first place, intimated to them that they would be sure to find 
the charity and kindness of the county, which they had found here where they 
were before, hardened and shut up against them; and that, on the other hand, 
they would be questioned wherever they came, and would be in danger of 
violence from others in like cases as themselves. 

Upon all these considerations John, their captain, in all their names, went 
back to their good friend and benefactor, who had relieved them before, and 
laying their case truly before him, humbly asked his advice; and he as kindly 
advised them to take up their old quarters again, or if not, to remove but a 
little farther out of the road, and directed them to a proper place for them; 
as they really wanted some house rather than huts to shelter them at that time 
of the year, it growing on towards Michaelmas, they found an old decayed 
house, which had been formerly some cottage or little habitation, but was 30 
out of repair as scarce habitable, and by the consent of a farmer to whose farm 
it belonged, they got leave to make what use of it they could. 

The ingenious joiner and all the rest, by his directions, went to work wWl 
it, and in a very few days made it capable to shelter them all in case of bad 
weather, and in which there was an old chimney and an old oven, though both 
lying in ruins; yet they made them both fit for use, and raising additions, sheda, 
and lean-^tos on every side, they soon made the house capable to hold them alL 

They chiefly wanted boards to make window-shutters, floors, doors, and 
severiau other* tnings; but as the gentlemen above favoured them, and the cowr 
try was by that means made easy with them, and, above all, that they w^e 
known to be all sound and in good health, everybody helped them with what 
they cpuld spare. 

Here they encamped for good and all, and resolved to remove no xnm*

They saw plainly how terribly alarmed that county was everywhere at 
anyTOdy that came from London, and that they should have no admittance 
anywhere but with the utmost difficulty, at least no friendly reception and 
assistance, as they had received here. 

Now, although they received great assistance and encouragement from the 
country gentlemen and from the people round about them, yet they were put 
to ^eat straits, for the weather grew cold and wet in October and November, 
ana they had not been used to so much hardship; so that they got colds in their 
limbs and distempers, but never had the infection; and thus about December 
they came home to the city again. / 

I give this story thus at large, principally to give an account what became 
of the great numbers of people which immediately appeared in the city\as soon 
as the sickness abated; for, as I have said, great numbers of those that wkre able 
and had retreats in the country fled to those retreats. So, when it was increased 
to such a frightful extremity as 1 have related, the middling people wl^o had 
not friends fled to all parts of the country where they could get shelter, as 
well those that had money to relieve themselves as those that had not. Those 
that had money always fled farthest, because they were able to subsist them- 
selves; but those who were empty suffered, as I have said, great hardships, and 
were often driven by necessity to relieve their wants at the expense of the 
country. By that means the country was made very uneasy at them, and some- 
times took them up, though even then they scarce knew what to do with them, 
and were always very backward to punish them, but often, too, they forced 
them from place to place, till they were obliged to come back again to London. 

I have, since my knowing this story of John and his brother, inquired and 
found that there were a great many of the poor disconsolate people, as above, 
fled into the country every way, and some of them got little sheds, and barns, 
and outhouses to live in, where they could obtain so much kindness of the 
country, and especially where they had any the least satisfactory account to 
rive or themselves, and particularly that they did not come out of London too 
late. But others, and that in great numbers, built themselves little huts and 
retreats in the fields and woods, and lived like hermits in holes and caves, or 
any place they could find, and where, we may be sure, they suffered great 
extremities, such that many of them were obliged to come back again whatever 
the danger was; and so those little huts were often found empty, and the coun- 
try people supposed the inhabitants lay dead in them of the plague, and would 
not go near them for fear, no, not in a great while; nor is it unlikely but that 
some of the unhappy wanderers might die so all alone, even sometimes for 
want of help, as particularly in one tent or hut was found a man dead, and 
on the gate of a field just by was cut with his knife, inVneven letters, the fol- 
lowing words, by which it may be supposed the other man escaped, or that, 
one dying first, the other buried him as well as he could:— 

“O mlsErY! 

We Both ShaLL DyE, 

WoE, WoE.’’ 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAOUE YEAR m 

I have given an account already of what I found to have been the case down 
the river among the seafaring men; how the ships lay in the offing, as it’s called, 
in rows or lines astern of one another, quite down from the Pool as far as I 
could see, I have been told that they lay in the same manner quite down the 
river as low as Gravesend, and some* far beyond, even everywhere, or in every 
place where they could ride with safety as to wind and weather; nor did I 
ever hear that the plague reached to any of the people on board those ships, 
except such as lay up in the Pool, or as high as Deptford Reach, although oie 
people went frequently on shore to the country towns and villages, and farm- 
ers’ houses, to buy fresh provisions, fowls, pigs, calves, and the like for their 
supply. 

Likewise I found that the watermen on the river above the bridge found 
means to convey themselves away up the river as far as they could go, and 
that they had, many of them, their whole families in their boats, covered with 
tilts and bales, as they call them, and furnished with straw within for their 
lodging, and that they lay thus all along by the shore in the marshes, some of 
them setting up little tents with their sails, and so lying under them on shore 
in the day, and going into their boats at night; and in this manner, as I have 
heard, the river-sides were lined with boats and people as long as they had 
anything to subsist on, or could get anything of the country; and, indeed, the 
country people, as well gentlemen as others, on these and all other occasions, 
were very forward to relieve them, but they were by no means willing to 
receive them into their towns and houses, and for that we cannot blame them. 

There was one unhappy citizen, within my knowledge, who had been visited 
in a dreadful manner, so that his wife and all his children were dead, and him- 
self and two servants only left, with an elderly woman, a near relation, who 
had nursed those that were dead as well as she could. This disconsolate man 
goes to a village near the town, though not within the bills of mortality, and 
findii^ an empty house there, inquires out the owner, and took the house. 
After a few days he got a cart and loaded it with goods, and carries them 
down to the house; the people of the village opposed his driving the cart along, 
but with some arguings and some force, the men that drove the cart along got 
through the street up to the door of the house. There the constable resisted 
them again, and would not let them be brought in. The man caused the goods 
to be unloaden and laid at the door, and sent the cart away; upon which they 
carried the man before a justice of peace; that is to say, they commanded 
him to go, which he did. The justice ordered him to cause the cart to fetch 
away the goods again, which he refused to do; upon which the justice ordered 
the constable to pursue the carters and fetch them back, and make them reload 
the goods and carry them away, or to set them in the stocks till they came for 
further orders; and if they could not find them, nor the man would not consent 
to take them away, they should cause them to be drawn with hooks from the 
house-door and burned in the street. The poor distressed man upon this fetched 
the goods again, but with grievous cnes and lamentations at the hardship of 
his case. But there was no remedy; self-preservation obliged die people to those 
severities, which they would not otherwise have been concerned in. Whether 



4$8 WORKS OP DAMEL 0EPOE 

tShis poor man lived or died I cannot tell, bnt it was reported that he had the 
upon him at that time; and perhaps the people might report that to 
jusfify their usap of him; but it was not unlikely that either he or his goods, 
or both, were dangerous, when his whole famijiy had been dead of the dis- 
temper so little a while before. 

1 know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent to London were much 
blamed for cruelty to the poor people that ran from the contagion in their 
distress, and many very severe things were done, as may be seen from what 
has been said; but I cannot but say aEo that, where there was room for charity 
and assistance to the people, without apparent danger to themselves, they were 
willing enough to help and relieve them. But as every town were indeed judges 
in their own case, so the poor people who ran abroad in their extremities were 
often ill-used and driven back again into the town; and this causecl infinite 
exclamations and outcries against the country towns, and made the clamour 
very popular. 

And yet, more ot less, maugre all the caution, there was not a town\of any 
note within ten (or, I believe, twenty) miles of the city but what was more 
or less infected and had some died among them. I have heard the accounts 
of several, such as they were reckoned up, as follows:— 


In Enfield . 32 In Deptford 623 

** Hornsey 58 “ Greenwich . . . .231 

** Newington 17 “ Eltham and Lusum . . , 85

Another thing might render the country more strict with respect to the citi- 
zens, and especially with respect to the poor, and this was what I hinted at 
before, namely, that there was a seeming propensity or a wicked inclination 
in those that were infected to infect others. 

There had been great debates among our physicians as to the reason of this. 
Some will have it to be in the nature of the disease, aiyl that it impre^es every 
bne that is seized upon by it with a kind of a ra^, and a hatred against their 
qwn kind, as if there was a malignity not only in the ^stemper to communi- 
cate itself, but in the very nature of man, prompting him with evil will or an 
evil eye, that, as they say in the case of a mad dog, who, though the gentlest 
creature brifbre of any of his kind, yet then will fly upon and bite any one that 
next him, and those as soon as any who had been most observed by him 
before. 



A JOUENAL OP THE MAOUE tEAE #1 

Odiers |ifac6d it to the account of the corruption of human nature) who caiJk 
not bear to ^ itself more miserable than others of its own species^ ha$ a 
kind of involuntary wish that all men were as unhappy or in as had a condition 
as itself. 

Others say it was only a kind of desperation, not knowing or regarding what 
they did, and consequently unconcerned at the danger or safety, not only of 
anybody near them, but even of themselves also. And indeed when men are 
once come to a condition to abandon themselves, and be unconcerned for the 
safety or at the danger of themselves, it cannot be so much wondered that 
they should be careless of the safety of other people. 

But I choose to give this grave debate a quite different turn, and answer it 
or resolve it all by saying that I do not grant the fact. On the contrary, I say 
that the thing is not really so, but that it was a general complaint raised by the 
people inhabiting the outlying villages against the citizens to justify, or at least 
excuse, those hardships and severities so much talked of, and in which com- 
pl^ts both sides may be said to have injured one another; that is to say, 
citizens pressing to be received and harboured in time of distress, and with the 
plague upon them, complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country people 
m b^eing refused entrance and forced back again with their goods and families^ 
and the inhabitants, findmg themselves so imposed upon, and the citizens break- 
ing in as it were upon them whether they would or no, complain that when 
they were infected they were not only regardless of others, but even willing 
to infect them; neither of which were really true, that is to say, in the colours 
they were described in. 

It is true there is something to be said for the frequent alarms which were 
given to the country of the resolution of the people of London to come out 
by force, not only for relief, but to plunder and rob; that they ran about the 
streets with the distemper upon them without any control; and that no care 
was taken to shut up houses, and confine the sick people from infecting others; 
whereas, to do the Londoners justice, they never practised such things, except 
in such particular cases as I have mentioned above, and such like. On the other 
hand, everything was managed with so much care, and such excellent order 
was observed in the whole city and suburbs by the care of the Lord J^yor 
and aldermen, and by the justices of the peace, church-wardens, &c., in the 
out-parts, that London may be a pattern to all the cities in the world fot t|he 
good government and the excellent order that was everywhere kept, even in 
the time of the most violent infection, and when the people were in the utmost 
consternation and distress. But of this I shall speak by itself. 

One thing, it is to be observed, was owing prmcipally to the prudence of ^ 
magistrates, and ought to be mentioned to dneir honour, viz., the moderation 
wMch they used in the great and difiicult work of shutting up of houses. It is 
true, as I have mentioned, that the shutting up of houses was a great subject 
of discontent, and I may say indeed the only subject of discontent amoi^ 
people at that time; for the confining the sound in the same house with the sick 
was counted very terrible, and the complaints of people so confined were ve^ 
grievous. They were heard into the very streets, and they w«e sometimes sMtt 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

that called for resentment, though oftener for compai^on* They had no way 
to converse with any of their mends but out at tneir windows, where they 
would make such piteous lamentations as often moved the hearts of those they 
talked with, and of others who, passing by, heard their story; and as those 
complaints oftentimes reproached the severity, and sometimes the insolence, 
of the watchmen placed at their doors, those watchmen would answer saucily 
enough, and perhaps be apt to afiFront the people who were in the street talking 
to the said families; for which, or for their ill-treatment of the families, I think 
seven or eight of them in several places were killed; I know not whether I 
should say murdered or not, because I cannot enter into the particular cases. 
It is true the watchmen were on then duty, and acting in the post where they 
were placed by a lawful authority; and killing any public legal officer\ in the 
execution of his office is always, in the language of the law, called murder. But 
as they were not authorised by the magistrates’ instructions, or by the power 
they acted under, to be injurious or abusive, either to the people who\were 
under their observation, or to any that concerned themselves for thei^; so 
when they did so, they might be said to act themselves, not their office; to act 
as private persons, not as persons employed; and consequently, if they brought 
mischief upon themselves by such an undue behaviour, that mischief was upon 
their own heads; and indeed they had so much the hearty curses of the people, 
whedier they deserved it or not, that whatever befell them nobody pitied them, 
and everybody was apt to say they deserved it, whatever it was. Nor do I 
remember that anybody was ever punished, at least to any considerable decree, 
for whatever was done to the watchmen that guarded their houses. 

What variety of stratagems were used to escape and get out of houses thus 
shut up, by which the watchmen were deceived or overpowered, and that the 
people got away, I have taken notice of already, and shall say no more to that. 
But I say the magistrates did moderate and ease families upon many occasions 
in this case, and particularly in that of taking away, or suffering to be removed, 
the sick persons out of such houses when they were willing to be removed 
either to a pest-house or other places, and sometimes givi^ the well persons 
in the family so shut up leave to remove upon information given that they 
were well, and that they would confine themselves in such houses where they 
went so long as should be required of them. The concern, also, of the mac- 
erates for the supplying such poor families as were infected— I say, supplying 
them with necessaries, as well phj^sic as food— was very great, and in which 
they did not content themselves with giving the necessary orders to the officers 
appointed, but the aldermen in person, and on horsAack, frequently rode to 
such houses and caused the people to be asked at their windows whether they 
were duly attended or not; also, whether they wanted anything that was neces- 
sary, and if the officers had constantly carried their messages and fetched them 
such things as they wanted or not. And if they answered in the affirmative, all 
was well; but if they complained that they were ill supplied, and that the offi- 
cer did not do his duty, or did not treat them civilly, they (the officers) were 
genei^y removed, and others placed in their stead. 

Ir is true such complaint might be unjust, and if the officer had such argu-

meiiis to UM » would convince the nugistrate that he was r^t, and that the 
people had inji^ed him, he was continued and they reproved. But this part 
could not well bear a particular inquiry, for the parties could very ill be well 
heard and angered in the street from the windows, as was the case then, TTie 
magistrates, therefore, generally chose to favour the people and remove the 
man, as what seemed to be the least wrong and of the least ill consequence; 
seeing if the watchman was injured, yet they could easily make him amends 
by giving him another post of the like nature; but if the family was injured, 
there was no sadsfacdon could be made to them, the damage perhaps being 
irreparable, as it concerned their lives. ^ 

A great variety of these cases frequendy happened between the watchmen 
and the poor people shut up, besides those I formerly mentioned about escap- 
ing. Somedmes the watchmen were absent, somedmes drunk, somedmes asleep 
when the people wanted them, and such never failed to be punished severely, 
as indeed they deserved. 

But after all that was or could be done in these cases, the shutting up of 
houses, so as to confine those that were well with those that were sick, had 
very great inconveniences in it, and some that were very tragical, and which 
merited to have been considered if there had been room for it. But it was 
authorised by a law, it had the public good in view as the end chiefly aimed 
at, and all the private injuries that were done by the putdng it in execudon 
must be put to the account of the public benefit. 

It is doubtful to this day whether, in the whole, it contributed anything to 
the stop of the infection, and, indeed, I cannot say it did, for nothing could 
run with greater fury and rage than the infecdon did when it was in its chief 
violence, though the houses infected were shut up as exactly and as effectually 
as it was possible. Certain it is that if all the infected persons were effectually 
shut in, no sound person could have been infected by them, because they could 
not have come near them. But the case was this, and I shall only touch it here, 
namely, that the infecdon was propagated insensibly, and bj^ such persons as 
were not visibly infected, who neither knew whom they infected or who 
they were infected by. 

A house in Whitechapel was shut up for the sake of one infected maid, who 
had only spots, not the tokens come out upon her, and recovered; yet these 
people obtained no liberty to stir, neither for air or exercise forty days. Want 
of breath, fear, anger, vexation, and all the other griefs attending such an 
injurious treatment cast the mistress of the family into a fever,^ and visitors 
came into the house and said it was the plague, though the physicians declared 
it was not. However, the family were obliged to begin their quarantine anew 
on the report of the visitor or examiner, though their former quarantine 
wanted but a few days of being finished. This oppressed them so with anger 
and grief, and, as before, straitened them also so much as to room, and for 
want of breathing and free air, that most of the family fell sick, one of me 
distemper, one of another, chiefly scorbutic ailments; only one a violent cone; 
till, after several prolongings of their confinement, some or other of those that 
came in with the visitors to inspect the persons that were ill, in hopes of 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

wdesmig them, brought the distemper with them mi infected the whole house, 
end all or most of mem died, not of the plague as really upon them before, 
but of the plague that those people brought them, who should have been 
careful to have protected them from it. And this was a thing which frequently 
happened, and was, indeed, one of the worst consequences of shutting houses 
up. * 

I had about this time a little hardship put upon me, which I was at first 
greatly aflhcted at, and very much disturbed about, though, as it proved, it did 
not expose me to any disaster; and this was being appointed by the alderman 
of Portsoken Ward one of the examiners of the houses in the preciiu:t where 
I lived. We had a large parish, and had no less than eighteen examine^, as the 
order called us; the people called us visitors. I endeavoured with all my might 
to be excused from such an employment, and used many arguments with the 
alderman’s deputy to be excused; particularly I alleged that I was\ against 
shutting up houses at all, and that it would be very hard to oblige me to be an 
instilment in that which was against my judgment, and which I did^ verily 
believe would not answer the end it was intended for; but all the abatement 
I could get was only, that whereas the oflScer was appointed by my Lord 
Mayor to continue two months, I should be obliged to hold it but three weeks, 
on condition nevertheless that I could then get some other sufficient house- 
keeper to serve the rest of the time for me, which was, in short, but a very 
smw favour, it being very difficult to get any man to accept of such an em- 
ployment, that was fit to be entrusted with it. 

It is true that shutting up of houses had one effect, which 1 am sensible was 
of moment, namely, it confined the distempered people, who would otherwise 
havelieen both very troublesome and very dangerous in their running about 
streets with the distemper upon them, which, when they were delirious, they 
would have done in a most frightful manner, and as indeed they began to do at 
first very much, till they were thus restrained; nay, so very open they were 
lliat the poor would go about and beg at people^s doors, and say they had 
the plague upon them, and beg rags for their sores, or both, or anything that 
delirious nature happened to think of. 

A poor, unhappy gentlewoman, a substantial citizen’s wife, was (if the story 
be true) murdered by one of these creatures in Aldersgate Street, or that way. 
He was going along the street, raving mad, to be sure, and singing; the people 
ofily said he was drunk, but he himself said he had the plague upon turn, 
which, it seems, was true; and meeting this gentlewoman, he would kiss her. 
I^e was terribly frighted^ as he was only a rude fellow, and she ran from him, 
but die street being very thin of people, there was nobody near enough to help 
W. When she saw he would overtake her, she turned and gave him a thrust so 
Wdbly, he being but weak, and pushed him down backward. But very 
unhappily, she being so near, he caught hold of her, and pulled her down also, 
jafid getting up first, mastered her, and kissed her; and which was worst of 
allf whm he had done, told her he had the plague, and why should not she have 
it as wdli as he? She was frighted enough before, being also young with child; 
tmt wlMsn she heard him say he had the plague, she screamed out and fell down 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE TEAR 4® 

into a swoon, or in a fit, which, though recovered a little, yet I nl lfwl her in 
a very few and I never heard whether die had the pl^e or no. 

Another infected person came and knocked at the door of a citizen’s house * 
where they knew him very well; the servant let him in, and being told the 
m^er of the house was above, he ran up, and came into the room to them as 
the whole family was at supper. They began to rise up, a little surprised, not 
knowing what the matter was, but he bid them sit still, he only came to take 
bis leave of them. They asked him, “Why, Mr. — , where are you gorngi*^ 
“Going?” says he; “I have got the sickness, and shall die to-morrow nignt/* 
TTis easy to believe, though not to describe, the consternation they were all in. 
The women and the man^s daughters, which were but little girls, were frighted 
almost to death, and got up, one running out at one door and one at another^ 
some downstairs and some upstairs, and getting together as well as they could, 
locked themselves into their chambers, and screamed out at the window fpc 
help, as if they had been frighted out of their wits. The master, more com- 
posed than they, though both frighted and provoked, was going to lay hands 
on him and throw him downstairs, being in a passion, but then, considering a 
little the condition of the man and the danger of touching him, horror seized 
his mind, and he stood still like one astonished. The poor distempered man all 
this while, being as well diseased in his brain as in his body, stood still like one 
amazed. At length he turns round: “Ay!” says he, with all the seeming calm’-' 
ness imaginable, “is it so with you all? Are you all disturbed at me? Why, then 
I’ll e’en go home and die there.” And so he goes immediately downstairs. The 
servant that had let him in goes down after him with a candle, but was afraid 
to go past him and open the door, so he stood on the stairs to see what he 
would do. The man went and opened the door, and went out and flung the 
door after him. It was some while before the family recovered the fright, 
as no ill consequence attended, they have had occasion since to speak of it 
(you may be sure) with great satisfaction. Though the man was gone, it was 
some time, nay, as I heard, some days before they recovered themselves of the 
hurry they were in; nor did they go up and down the house with any 
assurance till they had burnt a great variety of fumes and perfumes in all the 
rooms, and made a great many smokes of pitch, of gunpowder, and of sulphut, 
all separately shifted, and washed their clothes, and the like. As to the poor 
man, whether he lived or died I don’t remember. 

It is most certain that, if by the shutting up of houses the sick had not been 
confined, multitudes who, in the height of their fever, were delirious and 
distracted would have been continually running im and down the streets; and 
even as it was a very great number did so, and offered all sorts* of violence to 
those they met, even just as a mad dog runs on and bites at every one he meets; 
nor can I doubt but that, should one of those infected, diseased creatures hav^ 
bitten any man or woman while the frenzy of the distcmjper was u|wn them, 
they, I mean the person so wounded, would as certainly have ^n incurably 
infected as one that was sick before, and had the tokens upon him. ^ 

I heard of one infected creature who, running out of his bed in his shirt m 
the anguish and agony of his swellings, of which he had three upon him, gctt 



464 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

Ikis shoes on and went to put on his coat; but the nurse resisting, and snatching 
the coat from him, he threw her down, ran over her, ran downstairs and into 
the street, directly to the Thames in his shirt, the nurse running after him, and 
calling to the watch to stop him; but the .watchman, frighted at the man, and 
afraid to touch him, let him go on; upon which he ran down to the Stillyard 
stairs, threw away his shirt, and plunged into the Thames, and, being a good 
swimmer, swam quite over the river; and the tide being coming in, as they call 
it, that is, running westward, he reached the land not till he came about the Fal- 
con stairs, where landing, and finding no people there, it being in the, night, he 
ran about the streets there, naked as he was, for a good while, when, it being 
by that time high water, he takes the river again, and swam back to I the Still- 
yard, landed, ran up the streets again to his own house, knocking at the door, 
went up the stairs and into his bed again; and that this terrible experiment 
cured him of the plague, that is to say, that the violent motion of nis arms 
and legs stretched the parts where the swellings he had upon him wotc, that 
is to say, under his arms and his groin, and caused them to ripen and break, and 
that the cold of the water abated the fever in his blood. 

I have only to add that I do not relate this any more than some of the other, 
as a fact within my own knowledge, so as that I can vouch the truth of them, 
and especially that of the man being cured by the extravagant adventure, which 
I confess I do not think very possible; but it may serve to confirm the many 
desperate things which the distressed people falling into deliriums, and what 
we call light headedness, were frequently run upon at that time, an^ how 
infinitely more such there would have been if such people had not been 
confined by the shutting up of houses; and this I take to be the best, if not the 
onty good thing which was performed by that severe method. 

On the other hand, the complaints and the murmurings were very bitter 
against the thing itself. It would pierce the hearts of all that came by to hear 
the piteous cries of those infected people, who, being thus out of their under- 
standings by the violence of their pain, or the heat of their blood, were either 
shut in or perhaps tied in their beds and chairs, to prevent their doing them- 
selves hurt, and who would make a dreadful outcry at their being confined, 
and at their being not permitted to die at large, as they called it, and as they 
would have done before. 

This running of distempered people about the streets was very dismal, and 
the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it; but as it was generally in the 
n^ht and always sudden when such attempts were made, the officers could not 
be at hand to prevent it; and even when any got out in the day, the officers 
appointed did not care to meddle with thenv because, as they were all 
grievously infected, to be sure, when they were come to that height, so they 
were more than ordinarily infectious, and it was one of the most daiigerous 
iJimffS that could be to touch them. On the other hand, they generally ran on, 
l)Ot Imowing what they did, rill they dropped down stark dead, or rill they 
I^d exhausted their spirits so as that they would fall and then die in perhaps 
%|df*an-hour or an hour; and, which was most piteous to hear, they were 
Wre to come to themselves entirely in that half-hour or hour, and then to

make mo^ grievous and piercing cries and lamentations in the deep, afflicting 
s^e of the condmon they were in. This was much of it before the order to 
shutting up of houses were stnctly put in execution, for at first the watchmen 
were not so vigorous and severe as they were afterward in the keeping the 
people in; that is to say, before they were, I mean some of them, se^ely 
punished for their neglect, failing in their duty, and letting people who were 
under their care shp away, or conniving at their going abroad, whether sick 
or well. But after they saw the officers appointed to examine into their conduct 
were resolved to have them do their duty or be punished for the omission, 
they were more exact, and the people were strictly restrained; which was a 
thing they took so ill and bore so impatiently that their discontents can hardly 
be described. But there was an absolute necessity for it, that must be confessed 
unless some other measures had been timely entered upon, and it was too late 
for that. 


Had not this particular of the sick being restrained as above been our case 
at that time, London would have been the most dreadful place that ever was in 
the world; there would, for aught I know, have as many people died in the 
streets as died in their houses; for when the distemper was at its height it 
generally made them raving and delirious, and when they were so they would 
never be persuaded to keep in their beds but by force; and many who were not 
tied threw themselves out of windows, when they found they could not get 
leave to go out of their doors. 

It was for want of people conversing one with another, in this time of 
calamity, that it was impossible any particular person could come at the 
knowledge of all the extraordinary cases that occurred in different families; 
and particularly I believe it was never known to this day how many people 
in their deliriums drowned themselves in the Thames, and in the river which 


runs from the marshes by Hackney, which we generally called Ware River, or 
Hackney River. As to those which were set down in the weekly bill, they 
were indeed few; nor could it be known of any of those whether they 
drowned themselves by accident or not. But I believe I might reckon up 
more who, within the compass of my knowledge or observation, really 
drowned themselves in that year than are put down in the bill of all put 
together, for many of the bodies were never found who yet were known to be 
lost; and the like in other methods of self-destruction. There was also one man 
in or about Whitecross Street burned himself to death in his bed; some said 
it was done by himself, others that it was by the treachery of the nurse that 
attended him; but that he had the plague upon him was agreed by all. 

It was a merciful disposition or Providence also, and which I have many 
times thought of at that time, that no fires, or no considerable on^ at least, 
happened in the city during that year, which, if it had been otherwise, would 
have been very dreadful; and either the people must have let them alone 
uncjuenched, or have come together in great crowds and throngs, unconcerned 
at the danger of the infection, not concerned at the houses they went into, 
at the goods they handled, or at the persons or the people they came among* 
But so it was, that excepting that in Cripplcgate parish, and two or three lime

^pdozis of fires, which were presently extinguished, there was no disaster 
of mat kind happened in thfe whole year. They told us a story of a house in a 
place c^cd Swan Alley, passing from Goswell Street, near the end of Old 
Street, into St, John Street, that a family was infected there in so terrible a 
manner that every one of the house died. The last person lay dead on the 
floor, and, as it is supposed, had laid herself all alone to die just before the fire; 
die fire, it seems, had fallen from its place, being of wood, and had taken hold 
of the boards and the joists they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the body, 
but had not taken hold of the dead body, though she had little more than her 
shift on, and had gone out of itself, not hurting the rest of the hous^, though 
it was a slight timber house. How true this might be I do not determine, but 
the city being to suffer severely the next year by fire, this year it felt very 
Jitde of that calamity. \ 

Indeed, considering the deliriums which the agony threw people into, and 
how I have mentioned in their madness, when they were alone, they did many 
desperate things, it was very strange there were no more disasters of thlt kind. 

It has been frequently asked me, and I cannot say that I ever knew how to 
give a direct answer to it, how it came to pass that so many infected people 
appeared abroad in the streets at the same time that the houses which were 
infected were so vigilantly searched, and all of them shut up and guarded as 
they were. 

I confess I know not what answer to give to this, unless it be this, that in so 
great and populous a city as this is it was impossible to discover every house 
that was imected as soon as it was so, or to shut up all the houses that were in- 
fected; so that people had the liberty of going about the streets, even where they 
pleased, unless they were known to belong to such-and-such infected houses. 

It is true that, as several physicians told my Lord Mayor, the fury of the 
contagion was such at some particular times, and people sickened so fast and 
died so soon, that it was impossible, and indeed to no purpose, to go about to 
inquire who was sick and who was well, or to shut them up with such exact- 
ness as the thing required, almost every house in a whole street being infected, 
and in many places every person in some 6f the houses; and that which was 
stfll worse, by the time that the houses were known to be infected, most of the 
persons infected would be stone dead, and the rest run away for fear of being 
shut up; so that it was to very small purpose to call them infected houses and 
shut them up, the infection having ravaged and taken its leave of the house 
before it was really known that the fainily was any way touched. 

This might be sufficient to convince any reasonable person, that as it was not 
in the power of the magistrates, or of any human methods of policy, to prevent 
the spreading the infection, so that this way of shutting up of houses was 
perfectly insufficient for that end. Indeed it seemed to have no manner of 
public good in it, equal or proportionable to the grievous burden that it was 
to tbe particular families that were so shut up; and, as far as I was employed 
by the public in directing that severity, I frequently found occasion to see that 
it nm mcapable of answering the end. For example, as I was desired, as a 
visitxir or examiner, to inquire into the particulars of several families which 



A JOURNAL'Ot THE PLAGUE YEAR 

were infected, we scarce came to any house where the plague had visibly 
app^cd m the family but that some of the family were fled and gone. Tlie 
ma^strates would resent this, and charge the examiners with being renuss in 
their examination or inspection. But by that means houses were long infected 
before it was known. Now, as I was in this dangerous office but half the 
appointed time, which was two months, it was long enough to inform mys^ 
that we were no way capable of coming at the knowledge of the true state 
any family but by inquiring at the door or of the neighbours. As for going 
into every house to search, that was a part no authority would offer to impose 
on the inhabitants, or^ any citizen would undertake, for it would have been 
exposing us to certain infection and death, and to the ruin of our own families, 
as well as of ourselves, nor would any citizen of probity, and that could be 
depended upon, have stayed in the town, if they had been made liable to such 
a severity. 

Seeing then that we could come at the certainty of things by no method but 
that of inquiry of the neighbours or of the family, and on that we could not 
justly depend, it was not possible but that the uncertainty of this matter 
would remain as above. 

It is true masters of families were bound by the order to give notice to the 
examiner of the place wherein he lived, within two hours after he should 
discover it, of any person being sick in his house, that is to say, having signs 
of the infection, but they found so many ways to evade this and excuse their 
negligence that they seldom gave that notice till they had taken measures to 
have every one escape out of the house who had a mind to escape, whether 
they were sick or sound, and while this was so, it is easy to see that the shutting 
up of houses was no way to be depended upon as a sufficient method for 
putting a stop to the infection, because, as I have said elsewhere, many of those 
that so went out of those infected houses had the plague really upon them, 
though they might really think themselves sound. And some of diese were the 
people that walked the streets till they fell down dead, not that they were sud-* 
denly struck with the distemper as with a bullet that killed with the stroke, but 
that they really had the infection in their blood long before; only, that as it 
preyed secretly on the vitals, it appeared not till it seized the heart with a 
mortal power, and the patient died in a moment, as with a sudden fainting or an 
apoplectic fit. 

I know that some even of our physicians thought for a time that those j^pie 
that so died in the streets were seized \)ut that moment they fell, as 8 they 
had been touched by a stroke from heaven, as men are killed by a flash of 
lightning, but they found reason to alter their opinion afterwards; for upon 
examining the bodies of such after they were dead, they always either had 
tokens upon them or other evident proofs of the distemper having been longer 
upon them than they had otherwise expected. 

This often was the reason that, as I have said, we that were exanuners were 
not able to come at the knowledge of the inf ection being entered kto a ho^ 
till it was too late to shut it up, and sometimes not till the people that vi^re left 
were all dead. In Petticoat Lane two houses together were infected, and several 



46$ WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

people ack; but the distemper was so well concealed, the examiner, who was 
my neighbour, got no knowledge of it till notice was sent him that the pewle 
were all dead, and that the carts should call there to fetch them away, 'fte 
two heads of the families concerted their measures, and so ordered their 
matters as that when the examiner was ih the neighbourhood they appeared 
generally at a time, and answered, that is, lied, for one another, or got some of 
the neighbourhood to say they were all in health, and, perhaps, knew no 
better, till, death making it impossible to keep it any longer as a secret, the 
dead-carts were called in the night to both the houses, and so it became public. 
But when the examiner ordered the constable to shut up the houses /there was 
nobody left in them but three people, two in one house, and one inlthe other, 
just dying, and a nurse in each house, who acknowledged that they Had buried 
five before, that the houses had been infected nine or ten days, and that for all 
the rest of the two families, which were many, they were gone, some sick, some 
well, or whether sick or well could not be known. \ 

In like manner, at another house in the same lane, a man having his family 
infected, but very unwilling to be shut up, when he could conceal it no longer, 
shut up himself; that is to say, he set the great red cross upon his door, with 
the words, *‘Lord have mercy upon us,” and so deluded the examiner, who 
supposed it had been done by the constable, by order of the other examiner, 
for there were two examiners to every district or precinct. By this means he 
had free egress and regress into his house again, and out of it, as he pleased, 
notwithstanding it was infected, till at length his stratagem was foufid out, 
and then he, with the sound part of his servants and family, made bff and 
escaped, so they were not shut up at all. 

These things made it very hard, if not impossible, as I have said, to prevent 
the spreading of an infection by the shutting up of houses, unless the people 
would think the shutting of their houses no grievance, and be so wilhng to 
have it done as that they would give notice duly and faithfully to the magis- 
trates of their being infected, as soon as it was known by themselves; but as 
that cannot be expected from them, and the examiners cannot be supposed, 
as above, to go into their houses to virit and search, all the good of shutting up 
houses will be defeated, and few houses will be shut up in time, except those 
of the poor, who cannot conceal it, and of some people who will be discovered 
by the terror and consternation which the thi^ put them into. 

I got myself discharged of the dangerous office I was in as soon as I could 
get another admitted, whom I had obtained for a little money to accept of it; 
and so, instead of serving the two months, which was directed, I was not 
above three weeks in it; and a great while too, considering it was in the month 
of August, at which time the distemper began to rage with great violence at 
our end of the town. 

In the execution of this office I could not refrain speaking my opinion among 
my neighbours as to this shutting up the people in their houses; in which we 
saw most evidently the severities that were used, though grievous in them- 
selves, had also this particular objection against them, namely, that they did not 
immtr the end, as I have said, but that the distempered people went day by

day about the streets; and it was our united opinion that a mctfiod to have 
removed the sound from the sick, in case of a particular house beim 
would have been much more reasonable on many accounts, leaving nobody 
with the sick persons but such as should, on such occasion, request to stay 
declare themselves content to be shiit up with them. ^ 

Our scheme for removing those that were sound from those that were sick 
was only in such houses as were infected, and confining the sick was no con- 
finement; those that could not stir would not complain while they were in their 
senses, and while they had the power of judging. Indeed, when they came to 
be delirious and light-headed, then they would cry out of the cruelty of being 
confined; but for the removal of those that were well, we thought it highly 
reasonable and just, for their own sakes, they should be removed from the 
sick, and that, for other people’s safe^, they should keep retired for a while, 
to see that they were sound, and might not infect others; and we thought 
twenty or thirty days enough for this. 

Now, certainly, if houses had been provided on purpose for those that were 
sound to perform this demiquarantine in, they would have much less reason 
to think themselves injured in such a restraint than in being confined with 
infected people in the houses where they lived. 

It is here, however, to be observed that after the funerals became so many 
that people could not toll the bell, mourn or weep, or wear black for one 
another, as they did before; no, nor so much as make cofiins for those that 
died; so after a while the fury of the infection appeared to be so increased 
that, in short, they shut up no houses at all. It seemed enough that all the 
remedies of that kind had been used till they were found fruitless, and that 
the plague spread itself with an irresistible fury; so that as the fire the succeed- 
ing year spread itself, and burned with such violence that the citizens, in 
despair, gave over their endeavours to extinguish it, so in the plague it came at 
last to such violence that the people sat still looking at one another, and 
seemed quite abandoned to despair; whole streets seemed to be desolated, and 
not to be shut up only, but to be emptied of their inhabitants; doors were left 
open, windows stood shattering with the wind in empty houses for want of 
people to shut them. In a word, people began to give up themselves to their 
fears, and to think that all regulations and methods were in vain, and that there 
was nothing to be hoped for but an universal desolation; and it was even in the 
height of this general despair that it pleased God to stay His hand, and to 
slacken the fury of the contagion in such a manner as was even surprising, like 
its beginning, and demonstrated it to be His own particular hand, and that 
above, if not without the agency of means, as I shall take notice of in its proper 
place. 

But I must still speak of the plague as in its height, raging even to desola- 
tion, and the people under the most dreadful consternation, even, as I have 
said, to despair. It is hardly credible to what excesses the passions of men 
carried them in this extremity of the distemper, and this part, I think, was as 
moving as the rest. What could affect a man in his fuU power of refle^n, 
and what could make deeper impressions on the soul, than to see a man almo^

naked, and got ont of his house, or perhaps out of his bed, into the street, 
come out of Harrow Alley, a populous conjunction or collection of aQeys, 
courts, and passages in the Butcher Row in Whitechapel,— I say, what could 
be more affecting than to see this poor man come out into the open street, run 
dancing and singing, and making a thoiisand antic gestures, with five or six 
women and children running after him, crying and calling upon him for the 
Lord’s sake, to come back, and entreating the help of others to bring him back, 
but all in vain, nobody daring to lay a hand upon him or to come near him? 

This was a most grievous and afiiicting thing to me, who saw it all from my 
own windows; for all this while the poor afflicted man was, as I ^bserved it, 
even then in the utmost agony of pain, having, as they said, two swmlings upon 
him, which could not be brought to break or to suppurate; but,\by laying 
strong caustics on them, the surgeons had, it seems, hopes to break tnjpm, which 
caustics were then upon him, burning his flesh as with a hot iron! I cannot 
say what became of this poor man, but I think he continued roving about in 
that manner till he fell down and died. 

No wonder the aspect of the city itself was frightful. The usual concourse 
of people in the streets, and which used to be supplied from our end of the 
town, was abated. The Exchange was not kept shut, indeed, but it was no 
more frequented. The fires were lost; they had been almost extinguished for 
some days by a very smart and hasty rain. But that was not all; some of the 
physicians insisted that they were not only no benefit, but injurious to the 
health of people. This they made a loud clamour about, and complained to the 
Lord Mayor about it. On the other hand, others of the same faculty, and 
eminent too, opposed them, and gave their reasons why the fires were, and 
must be, useful to assuage the violence of the distemper. I cannot give a full 
account of their arguments on both sides; only this I remember, that they 
cavilled very much with one another. Some were for fires, but that they must 
be made of wood and not coal, and of particular sorts of wood too, such as 
fir in particular, or cedar, because of the strong effluvia of turpentine; others 
were for coal and not wood, because of the sulphur and bitumen; and others 
were for neither one or other. Upon the whole, the Lord Mayor ordered no 
more fires, and especially on this account, namely, that the plague was so 
fierce that they saw evidently it defied all means, and rather seemed to 
increase than decrease upon any application to check and abate it; and yet 
this amazement of the magistrates proceeded rather from want of being able 
to Apply any means successfully than from any unwillingness either to expose 
themselves or undertake the care and weight of business; for, to do tnem 
justice, they neither spared their pains or their gprsons. But nothing answered; 
the infection raged, and the people were now frighted and terrified to the last 
degree, so that, as I may say, they gave themselves up, and, as I mentioned 
above, abandoned themselves to their despair. 

But let me observe here, that when I sav the people abandoned themselves 
to despair, I do not mean to what men call a reUgious despair, or a despair of 
tlieir eternal state, but I mean a despair of their being able to escape the 
la^ecdon or to outlive the plague, which, they saw, was so raging and so

irresistible in its force^ that indeed few people that were touched wilil it in its 
height, about August and September, escaped; and, which is very particular, 
contrary to its ordinary operation in June and July, and the bewnning of 
August, when, as 1 have observed^ many were infected, and continue so 
many days, and then went off, after havmg had the poison in their blood a 
long time; but now, on the contrary, most of the people who were taken 
during the wo last weeks in August, and in the three first weeks in September, 
generally died in wo or three days at furthest, and many the very same day 
they were taken; whether the dog-days, or, as our astrologers pretended to 
express themselves, the influence of the dog-star had that malignant effect, or 
all those who had the seeds of infection before in them brought it up to a 
maturity at that time altogether, I know not; but this was the time when it was 
reported, that above 3000 people died in one night; and they that would have 
us believe they more critically observed it pretend to say that they ail died 
within the space of wo hours, viz., beween the hours of one ana three in 
the morning. 

As to the suddenness of people’s dying at this time, more than before, there 
were innumerable instances of it, and I could name several in my neighbour- 
hood. One family without the Bars, and not far from me, were all seemingly 
well on the Monday, being ten in family. That evening one maid and one 
apprentice were taken ill, and died the next morning, when the other appren- 
tice and wo children were touched, whereof one died the same evening, 
and the other wo on Wednesday. In a word, by Saturday at noon the master, 
mistress, four children, and four servants were all gone, and the house left 
entirely empty, except an ancient woman who came in to take charge of the 
goods for the master of the family’s brother, who lived not far off, and who 
had not been sick. 

Many houses were then left desolate, all the people being carried away dead;^ 
and especially in an alley farther on the same side beyond the Bars, going in 
at the sign of Moses and Aaron, there were several houses together, which* 
they said, had not one person left alive in them, and some that died last in 
several of those houses were left a little too long before they were fetched out 
to be buried; the reason of which was not, as some have written, very untruly, 
that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead, but that the mo^lity was 
so great in the yard or alley that there was nobody left to give notice to the 
buriers or sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be buried. It was 
said, how true I know not, that some of those bodies were so much corrupted 
and so rotten that it was with difficulty they were carried; and as the carts 
could not come any nearer than to the Alley Gate in the High Street, it was 
80 much the more aifficult to bring them along; but I am not certain how xnsny 
bodies were then left. I am sure mat ordinarily it was not so. 

As I have mentioned how the people were brought into a condition to 
despair of life and abandon themselves, so this very thing had a strange effect 
among us for three or four weeks; that is, it made them bold and venturous, 
tfaty were no more shy of one another, or restrained within doors, but wefit 
anywhere and everywhere, and began to converse. One would say to anothei*. 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

T do not ask you how j^ou are, or say how I am; it is certain we shall all go* 
so ’ds no matter who is sick or who is sound;” and so they ran de^rately into 
any place or any company. 

As it brought the people into public co^any, so it was surpridng how it 
brought them to crowd into the churches. Tney inquired no more into whom 
they sat near to or far from, what offensive smells they met with, or what 
condition the people seemed to be in, but looking upon themselves all as so 
many dead corpses, they come to the churches without the least caution, and 
crowded together, as it their lives were of no consequence compared to the 
work which they came about there. Indeed, the zeal which they showed in 
coming, and the earnestness and affection they showed in their attention to 
what they heard, made it manifest what a value people would all pun upon the 
worship of God if they thought every day they attended at the church that it 
would oe their last. \ 

Nor was it without other strange effects, for it took away all manner of 
prejudice at or scruple about the person whom they found in the pulpit when 
they came to the churches. It cannot be doubted but that many of tne ministers 
of the parish churches were cut off, among others, in so common and dreadful 
a calamity; and others had not courage enough to stand it, but removed into 
the country as they found means for escape. As then some parish churches 
were quite vacant and forsaken, the people made no scruple of desiri^ such 
Dissenters as had been a few years before deprived of their livings by virtue of 
the Act of Parliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the churches; 
nor did the church ministers in that case make any difficulty of accepting their 
assistance; so that many of those whom they called silenced ministers had their 
mouths opened on this occasion and preached publicly to the people. 

Here we may observe, and I hope it will not be amiss to take notice of it, 
that a near view of death would soon reconcile men of good principles one 
to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our easy situation in life and our 
putting these things far from us that our breaches are fomented, ill blood 
continued, prejudices, breach of charity and of Christian union, so much kept 
and so far carried on among us as it is. Another plague year would reconcile 
all these differences; a close conversing with oeath, or with diseases that 
threaten death, would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the ammosi- 
ties among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes than those which wc 
looked on things with before. As the people who had been used to join with 
the Church were reconciled at this time with the admitting the Dissenters to 

E :h to them, so the Dissenters, who with an uncommon prejudice had 
en off from the communion of the Church of Eligland, were now content 
to come to their parish churches, and to conform to the worship which they 
did not approve of before; but as the terror of the infection abated, those 
things all returned again to their less desirable channel, and to the course they 
w^ in before. 

I mention this but historically. I have no mind to enter into arguments to 
move either or both sides to a more charitable compliance one with another. 
I do not see that it is probable such a discourse would be either suitable ot

successful; the breaches seem rather to widen, and tend to a widening lucdiM’, 
to closing, and who am I that I should think myself able to influence 
either one side or other? But this I may repeat again, that ’tis evident death 
will reconcile us all; on the other side the grave we sh^ be all brefliren again. 

In heaven, whither I hope we may come from all parties and persuasions, we 
.■h all find neither prejudice or scruple; there we shall be of one principle and oS 
one opinion. Why we cannot be content to go hand in hand to the place where 
we shall join heart and hand without the least hesitation, and with the most com* 
plete harmony and affection,—! say, why we cannot do so here 1 can say nothing 
to neither shall I say anything more of it but that it remains to be lamented. 

I could dwell a great while upon the calamities of this dreadful time, and go 
on to describe the objects that appeared among us every day, the dreadful 
extravagancies which the distraction of sick people drove them into; how the 
streets began now to be fuller of frightful objects, and families to be made 
even a terror to themselves. But after I have told you, as 1 have above, that one 
man, being tied in his bed, and finding no other way to deliver himself, set the 
bed on fire with his candle, which unhappOy stood within his reach, and burnt 
himself in his bed; and how another, by the insufferable torment he bore, 
danced and sung naked in the streets, not knowing one ecstasy from mother; I 
say after I have mentioned these things, what can be added more? What can 
be Mid to represent the misery of these times more lively to die reader, or to 
dive him a more perfect idea of a complicated distress? 

I must acknowledge that this time was terrible, that I was sometimes at the 
end of all my resolutions, and that I had not the courage that I had at tto 
beginning. As the extremity brought other peop e abroad, it 
and exceot having made my voyage down to Blackwall and Greenvach, ^ 1 
St Sed wEfeh was I ex^rsion, I kept afterwards very much wit^ 
doors, as I had for about a fortnight before. I have said aheady 
several rimes that I had ventured to stay m town, and had not gone 
mv brother and his family, but it was too late for that now; and after 1 had 
reL«ed and styed within doors a good while before my impatience led me

tmt « litde way. There, I say, k stood to receive dead bodies, and as th^ chnrch** 
ya^ was but a little way oif, if it went away full it would soon be baclc again. 
It is impossible to describe the most horrible cries and noise the poor people 
would make at their bringing the dead bodies of their children ana friends out 
of the cart, and by the number one would have thought there had been none 
left behind, or that there were people enough for a small city living in those 
places. Several times they cried “Murder,” sometimes “Fire;” but it was easy 
to perceive it was all distraction, and the complaints of distressed and dis> 
tempered people. 

1 believe it was everywhere thus at that time, for the plague raged ijbr six or 
seven weeks beyond all that I have expressed, and came even to such^^a height 
that, in the extremity, they began to break into that excellent order which 
1 have spoken so much in behalf of the magistrates, namely, that no dead 
bodies were seen in the streets or burials in the daytime, for there was neces- 
sity in this extremity to bear with its being otherwise for a little while. 

One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I thought it was extraordinary, at 
least it seemed a remarkable hand of Divine justice, viz., that all the predictors, 
astrologers, fortune-tellers, and what they called cunning-men, conjurers, and 
the like; calculators of nativities and dreamers of dreams, and such people, were 
gone and vanished; not one of them was to be found. I am verily persuaded 
5iat a great number of them fell in the heat of the calamity, having ventured 
to stay upon the prospect of getting great estates; and indeed their gain was 
but too great for a time, through the madness and folly of the people. But now 
they were silent; many of them went to their long home, not able to foretell 
their own fate or to calculate their own nativities. Some have been critical 
enough to say that every one of them died. 1 dare not affirm that; but this 1 
must own, that I never heard of one of them that ever appeared after the 
calamity was over. 

But to return to my particular observations during this dreadful part of the 
visitation. I am now come, as I have said, to the month of September, which 
was the most dreadful of its kind, I believe, that ever London saw; for, by all 
the accounts which I have seen of the preceding visitations which have been in 
London, notiiing has been like it, the number in the weekly bill amounting to 
almost 40,000 from the 22nd of August to the 26th of September, being but 
five weeks. The particulars of the buls are as follows, viz.;— 

I^rom August the 22nd to the 29th 
** “ 29th “ 5th September 

“ September the 5th “ 12th “ 

« nth “ 19th 
“ “ 19th “ 26th 


This was a prodigious number of itself, but if I should add the reasons 
wbidt I have to believe that this account was deficient, and how deficient it 
libras, you would, with me, make no scruple to believe that there died above 
Wi liioiisaiid a week for all those weeks, one week with another, and a propor-*

rion for severe weeks before and after. The confuakm amDOff the people. 
e^ecJsDy the city at that time, was inexpressible. Themtor ^ » 
great at that the courage of die people appointed to carry away die 
began to rail them; nay, sweral of d\em died, although they had the discenoMar 
before and were recovered, and some of them dropped down when they have 
been carrying the bodies even at the pit side, and just ready to throw them hu 
and this coirfusion was greater in the city, because they had flattered them* 
selves with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitterness of death was past# 
One cart, they told us, going up Shoreditch was forsaken of the driverj[ 
being left to one man to drive, he died in the street, and the horses going on^ 
overthrew the cart, and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some there, hi 
a dismal manner. Another cart was, it seems, found in the great pit in Finsbury 
Fields, the itivcr being dead, or having been gone and abandoned it, and the 
horses running too near it, the cart fell in and drew the horses in also. It was 
suggested that the driver was thrown in with it, and that the cart fell upon hi^ 
by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I 
suppose, could not be certain. 

In our parish of Aldgate the dead-carts were several times, as I have heard, 
found standing at the churchyard gate full of dead bodies, but neither bellman 
or driver or any one else with it, neither in these or many other cases did they 
know what bodies they had in their cart, for sometimes they were let down 
with ropes out of balconies and out of windows, and sometimes the bearers 
brought them to the cart, sometimes other people, nor, as the men themselves 
said, did they trouble themselves to keep any account of the numbers. 

The vigilance of the magistrates was now put to the utmost trial, and, it must 
be confessed, can never be enough acknowledged on this occasion also; whao 
ever expense or trouble they were at, two things were never neglected in the 
city or suburbs either— 

(i.) Provisions were always to be had in full plenty, and the price not much 
raised neither, hardly worth speaking. 

( 2 ,) No dead bodies lay unbuned or uncovered; and if one walked from one 
end of the city to another, no funeral or sign of it was to be seen in the day- 
time, except a little, as I have said above, in the tliree first weeks in September* 

This last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some accounts whidl 
others have published since that shall be seen, wherein they say that the dead 
lay unburied, which I am assured was utterly false; at least, if it had hteix aw^ 
where so, it must have been in houses where the living were gone from me* 
dead, haviiw found means, as I have observed, to esca|>e, and where no noow 
was given to the officers. All which amounts to nodung at aU in the cas6 m 
hand; for this I am positive in, having myself bcM employed a httle in the 
direction of that part in the parish in which I hved, Md where as great a 
desolation was made in proportion to die numb« of habitants u wm any- 
where —I say I am sure diat there were no dead bodies remamed unbuciM;

in Mose$ and Aaron Alleys is nothing; for it is most certain tb^ were 
buried as soon as they were found. As to the first article, namely, of povi^ 
sions, the scardty or dearness, though I have mentioned it before, and AM 
of it again, yet I must observe here-; 

(i.) The price of bread in particular v^as not much raised; for in the 
beginning of the year, viz., in the first week in March, the penny wheaten lotf 
was ten ounces and a half; and in the height of the contagion it was to be had 
at nine ounces and a half, and never dearer, no, not all that season. And about 
the beginning of Novemt^r it was sold ten ounces and a half again; the like of 
which, I believe, was never heard of in any city, under so dreadful ^ visitation, 
before. l 

(2.) Neither was there (which I wondered much at) any want o^ bakers or 
ovens kept open to supply the people with bread; but this was indeed alleged 
by some families, viz., that their maid-servants, going to the bakehewes with 
their dough to be baked, which was then the custom, sometimes caipe home 
with the sickness, that is to say, the plague upon them. 

In all this dreadful visitation there were, as I have said before, but two pest- 
houses made use of, viz., one in the fields beyond Old Street and one in West- 
minster; neither was there, any compulsion used in carrying people thither. 
Indeed there was no need of compulsion in the case, for there were thousands 
of poor distressed people who, having no help, or conveniences, or supplies but 
of charity, would have been very gkd to have been carried thither and been 
taken care of, which, indeed, was the only thing that I think was wanting in 
the whole public management of the city, seeing nobody was here allowed to 
be brought to the pest-house but where money was given, or security for 
money, either at their introducing or upon their being cured and sent out, for 
very many were sent out again whole; and very good physicians were ap- 
pointed to those places, so that many people did very well there, of which I 
shall make mention again. The principal sort of people sent thither were, as I 
have said, servants who got the distemper by going of errands to fetch neces- 
saries to the families where they lived, and who in that case, if they came 
home sick, were removed to preserve the rest of the house; and they were so 
well looked after there, in all the time of the visitation, that there was but 156 
buried in all at the London pest-house, and 1 59 at that of Westminster. 

By having more pest-houses I am far from meaning a forcing all people into 
such places. Had the shutting up of houses been omitted and the sick hurried 
Wt of their dwellings to pest-houses, as some proposed, it seems, at that time 
as well as since, it would certainly have been much worse than it was. The 
very removing the sick would have been a spreading of the infection, and the 
rather because that removing could not effectually clear the house where the 
sick person was of the distemper, and the rest of me family, being then left at 
liberty, would certainly spread it among others. 

The methods also in private families, which would have been univers^y 
used to have concealed the distemper, and to have concealed the persons b^ 
Aekf would have been such that the distemper would sometimes have seiw 
a whole family before any visitors or examiners could have known of it. On

iHe hand, the pro^gious num^ which would have been sick at « rime 
have ea^eeded all the capacity of public pest-houses to receive them, 
or of public officers to discover and remove them. 

This was well considered in those.days, and I have heard them talk of it 
often. The magistrates had enough to do to bring people to submit to having 
their houses shut up, and many ways they deceived the watchmen and got ou^ 
as I have observed. But that difficulty made it apparent that they would have 
found it impracticable to have gone the other way to work, for they could 
never have forced the sick people out of their beds and out of their dwellings. 
It must not have been my Lord Mayor’s officers, but an army of officers tmit 
must have attempted it; and the people, on the other hand, would have been 
enraged and desperate, and would have killed those that should have offered to 
have meddled with them or with their children and relations, whatever had 
befallen them for it; so that they would have made the people, who, as it was, 
were in the most terrible distraction imaginable,— I say, they would have made 
them stark mad; whereas the magistrates found it proper on several accounts to 
treat them with lenity and compassion, and not with violence and terror, such 
as dragging the sick out of their houses, or obliging them to remove them- 
selves, would have been. 

This leads me again to mention the time when the plague first began, that is 
to say, when it became certain that it would spread over the whole town, 
when, as I have said, the better sort of people first took the alarm, and began 
to hurry themselves out of town. It was true, as I observed in its place, that 
the throng was so great, and the coaches, horses, waggons, and carts were so 
many, driving and dragging the people away, that it looked as if all the city 
was running away; and had any regulations been published that had been 
terrifying at that time, especially such as would pretend to dispose of the 
people otherwise than they would dispose of themselves, it would have put 
both the city and suburbs into the utmost confusion. 

But the magistrates wisely caused the people to be encouraged, made very 
good bye-laws for the regulating the citizens, keeping good order in the streets, 
and making everything as eligible as possible to all sorts of people. 

In the first place, the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs, the Court of Aldermen, 
and a certain number of the Common Council men, or their deputies, came to 
a resolution and published it, viz., that they would not quit the city themselves, 
but that they would be always at hand for the preserving good order in every 
place and for the doing justice on ail occasions; as also for the distributing the 
public charity to the poor; and, in a word, for the doing the duty and discharg- 
ing the trust reposed in them by the citizens to the u^ost of their power. 

In pursuance of these orders, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, &c., held councils 
every day more or less, for making such dispositions as they found needful for 
preserving the civil peace; and though they used the people with all possible 
gentleness and clemency, yet all manner of presumptuous rogues, such as 
thieves, housebreakers, plunderers of the dead or of the sick, w^e dtaly 
punished, and several declarations were continually published by the Lord 
^yor and Court of Aldermen against such. 



4» WORKS OF DANIEL tffiFOE 

Also all oKatalito and dwrchwardens were anjdned to stay k th« dty 
upon severe penalties, or to depute such able and suffident housekeepers as the 
deputy aldermen or Common Council men of the precinct should approve, 
and for whom they should give security*,, and also security in case of mortality, 
that they would forthwith constitute other constables in their stead. 

These things re-established the minds of the people very much, especially in 
the first of their fright, when they talked of making so universal a flight that 
the city would have been in danger of being entirely deserted of its inhabitants, 
except the poor, and the counory of being plundered and laid w^e by the 
multitude. Nor were the magistrates de&ient in performing thiir part as 
boldly as they promised it; for my Lord Mayor and the sheriffs Were con- 
tinuaHy in the streets, and at places of the greatest danger, and though they 
did not care for having too great a resort of people crowding about xhem, yet 
in emergent case^they never denied the people access to them, and heard with 

E atience all their grievances and complaints. My Lord Mayor had a low gallery 
uilt on purpose in his hall, where he stood a little removed from the crowd 
when any complaint came to be heard, that he might appear with as much 
safety as possible. 

Likewise the proper officers, called my Lord Mayor’s officers, constantly 
attended in their turns, as they were in waiting; and if any of them were sick or 
infected, as some of them were, others were instantly employed to fill up and 
officiate in their places, till it was known whether the other should live or die. 

In like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in their several stations and 
wards, where they were placed by office, and the sheriffs’ officers or sergeants 
were appointed to receive orders from the respective aldermen in their turn, so 
that justice was executed in all cases without interruption. In the next place, 
it was one of their particular cares to see the orders for the freedom of the 
markets observed, and in this part either the Lord Mayor or one or both of the 
riieriffs were every market-day on horseback to see their orders executed, and 
to see that the country people had all possible encouragement and freedom in 
their coming to the markets and going back again, and that no nuisances or 
frightful objects should be seen in the streets to terrify them or make them 
unwilling to come. Also the bakers were taken under particular order, and the 
Master of the Bakers’ Company was, with his court of assistants, directed to 
see the order of my Lord Mayor for their regulation put in execution, and the 
due assize of bread, which was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor, ob- 
served, and all the bakers were obliged to keep their ovens going constantly, 
on pain of losing the privileges of a freeman ot the city of London. 

By this means bread was always to be had iirplehty, and as cheap as usual, 
as 1 said above; and provisions were never wanting in the markets, even to 
such a degree that I often wondered at it, and reproached myself with being 
so timorous and cautious in stirring abroad, when the country people came 
freely and boldly to market, as if there had been no manner of infection in the 
ci^, or danger of catching it. 

It was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in the said magistrates that the 
Streets were kept constantly clear, and free from all manner of frightful

objects, dead bodte, or my such things as were indecent or untdeasaiM; 
where anybody fell down suddenly or died in the streets, as I have said above, 
juid these were generally covered with some cloth or blanket, or removed into 
the next churchyard, all night. All the needful works that carried terror with 
them, that were both dismal and dangerous, were done in the night; if any 
diseased bodies were removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected clothes burnt, 
it was done in the night; and aU the bodies which were thrown into the great 
pits in the several churchyards or burying-grounds, as has been observed, were 
so removed in the night, and everything was covered and closed before day^ 
So that in die daytime there was not the least signal of the calamity to be seen 
or heard of, except what was to be observed from the emptiness or the streets, 
and sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamentations of the people, out 
at their windows, and from the numbers of houses and shops shut up. 

Nor was the silence and emptiness of the streets so muchJb the city as in 
the out-parts, except just at one particular time, when, as 1 haw mentioned, the 
plague came east and spread over all the city. It was indeed a merciful disposi- 
tion of God, that as the plague began at one end of the town first, as has oeen 
observed at iarge, so it proceeded progressively to other parts, and did not 
come on this way, or eastward, till it had spent its fury in the west part oi die 
town; and so, as it came on one way, it abated another. For example, it began 
at St. Giles’s and the Westminster end of the town, and it was in its height in 
all that part by about the middle of July, viz., in St. Giles-in-the-Fields, St. 
Andrew’s, Holborn, St. Clement Danes, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and in West- 
minster. The latter end of July it decreased in those parishes; and coming cast, 
it increased prodigiously in Cripplegate, St. Sepulchre’s, St. James’s, Clerk^- 
well, and St. Bride’s and Aldersgate. While it was in all these parishes, the city 
and all the parishes of the Southwark side of the water, and all Stepney, White- 
chapel, Aldgate, Wapping and Ratcliff, were very little touched, so that people 
went about their business unconcerned, carried on their trades, kept open their 
shops, and conversed freely with one another in all the city, the east and north- 
cast suburbs, and in Southwark, almost as if the plague had not been among us. 

Even when the north and north-west suburbs were fully infected, 
Cripplegate, Qerkenwell, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, yet still all the rest vmt 
tolerably well. For example, from 25th July to ist August the bill stood thiw 
of all diseases:—

So that» in short, there died xnore that week in the two parishes of Cripple- 
gate and St Sepulchre by forty-eight than in all the city, all the east suburbs^ 
and all the Southwark parishes put together. This caused the reputation of the 
city^s health to continue all over England!; and especially in the counties and 
markets adjacent, from whence our supply of provisions chiefly came, even 
much longer than that health itself continued; for when the people came into 
the streets from the country by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street 
and Snithfield, they would see the out-streets empty and the houses and shops 
shut, and the few people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the 
streets. But when they came within the city, there things looked better, and the 
markets and shops were open, and the people walking about the streets as 
usual, though not quite so many; and this continued till the latteli end of 
August and the beginning of September. 

But then the c$ise altered quite; the distemper abated in the west an4 north- 
west parishes, and the weight of the infection lay on the city and the eastern 
suburbs, and the Southwark side, and this in a frightful manner. 

Then, indeed, the city began to look dismal, shops to be shut, and the streets 
desolate. In the High Street, indeed, necessity made people stir abroad on 
many occasions; and there would be in the middle of the day a pretty many 
people, but in the mornings and evenings scarce any to be seen, even there, no, 
not in Cornhill and Cheapside. 

These observations of mine were abundantly confirmed by the weekly bills 
of mortality for those weeks, an abstract of which, as they respect the parishes 
which I have mentioned, and as they make the calculations I speak of very 
evident, take as follows. 

The weekly bill, which makes out this decrease of the burials in the west 
and north side of the city, stands thus:—

Here is a strange change of things indeed, and a sad change it was, and had it 
held for two months more than it did, very few people would have been left 
i^ve. But then such, I say, was the merciful disposition of God, that when it 
was thus the west and north part, which had been so dreadfully visited at first, 
grew, as you see, much better; and as the people disappeared here, they began

to look abroad again there; and the next week or two altered it still more; that 
is, more to the encouragement of the other part of die town. For example:*^

and of those parts where I hved at this parocm 



m wow or DANua tmm 

odic^ fMits, iiotwtchsmiding the great numbers of people tfiat ww gone intb 
the country, was vastly full of people, and perhaps the fuller because people 
had for a long time a strong belief that the plague would not come into the 
city, nor into Southwark, no, nor into W^pping or Ratcliff at all; nay, such 
was the assurance of the people on that head that many removed from the 
suburbs on the west and north sides, into those eastern and south sides as for 
safety, and, as I verily believe, carried the plague amongst them there, perhaps 
soono: than they would otherwise have had it. 

M^e also I ought to leave a further remark for the use of posterity, con- 
cerning the manner of people’s infecting one another; namely, that in was not 
the sick people only from whom the plague was immediately received by 
otbexs that were sound, but the well. To explain myself, by the sick people I 
m^an those who were Imown to be sick, had taken their beds, had been under 
cure, or had swellings and tumours upon them, and the like; these ev^body 
could beware of; they were either in their beds or in such condition a^ could 
not be concealed. 

By the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it really 
upon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the consequences of it in 
their countenances; n^, even were not sensible of it themselves, as many were 
not for several days. Tnese breathed death in every place, and upon everybody 
who came near them; nay, their very clothes retained the infection, their hanas 
would infect the things they touched, especially if they were warm and sweaty, 
and they were generally apt to sweat too. 

Now it was impossible to know these people, nor did they sometimes, as I 
have said, know themselves to be infected. These were the people that so often 
dropped down and fainted in the streets; for oftentimes they would go abou^ 
the streets to the last, till on a sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit down at 
a door and die. It is true, finding themselves thus, they would struggle hard to 
get home to their own doors, or at other times would be just able to go into 
their houses and die instantly; ocher times they would go about till they had 
the very tokens come out upon them, and yet not know it, and would die in an 
hour or two after they came home, but be well as long as they were abroad. 
These were the dangerous people; these were the people of whom the well 
people ought to have been afraid; but then, on the other side, it was impossible 
to fctiow mem. 


And this is the reason why it is impossible in a visitation to prevent the 
Sj^eading of the plawe by the utmost human vigilance, viz., that it is impossi- 
ble to know the infixed people from the sound, or that the infected people 
riiouid perfectly know themselves. I knew a milli who conversed freely in 
London all the season of the plague in 1665, and kept about him an antidote or 
cordial, on purpose to take when he thought himself in any danger, and he had 
endi a rule to know or have warning of the danger by as indeed 1 never met 
vririi before or since. How far it may be depended on I know not. He had ft 
wound in his leg, and whenever he came among any peotde that were not 
, illlid, and the imecdon began to affect him, he said tie could know it by that 
I dlpenl, viZn that his wound in his leg would smart, and look pale and white; 



A JOURNAL OB THE PLAGUE VEAR 41 ^ 

so as «s evCT he felt it smm it was time for Wm to withdraw, <yr to take 
care of Itself, taking ^ dnn^ which he always carried about to for S 
purp^. Now It seeiiB he found his wound would smart many times when he 
was m TOmpany with rach who thought themselves to be sound, and who 
appeared so to one another; but he would presendy rise up and say publidy, 
“Friends, here is somebody in the room that has the plague,” and so would 
immediately break up the company. This was indeed a faithful monitor to all 
people that the pl^ue is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscii«* 
ously m a town mfected, and people have it when they know it not, and t hat 
they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it them** 
selves, and in this case shutting up the well or removing the sick will not do it, 
unless they can go back and shut up all those that the sick had conversed wtth^ 
even before they knew themselves to be sick, and none knows how far to 
carry that back, or where to stop; for none knows when, or where, or how 
they may have received the infection, or from whom. 

This I take to be the reason which makes so many people talk of the air 
being corrupted and infected, and that they need not be cautious of whom 
they converse with, for that the contagion was in the air. I have seen them in 
strange agitations and surprises on this account. “I have never come near any 
infected body,” says the disturbed person; “I have conversed with none but 
sound, healthy people, and yet 1 have gotten the distemper!” “I am sure I am 
struck from Heaven,” says another, and he falls to the serious part Again, the 
first goes on exclaiming, have come near no infection or any infected 
person, I am sure it is in the air. We draw in death when we breathe, and 
therefore ’tis the hand of God; there is no withstanding it” And this at last 
made many people, being hardened to the danger, grow less concerned at it, 
and less caunous towards the latter end of the time, and when it was come to 
its height, than they were at first. Then, with a land of a Turkish predes- 
tinarianism, they would say, if it pleased God to strike them, it was all one 
whether they went abroad or stayed at home; they could not csc^e it, and 
therefore they went boldly about, even into infected houses and mfected 
company; visited sick people; and, in short, lay in the beds with their wives 
or relations when they were infected. And what was the consequence, but the 
same that is the consequence in Turkey, and in those countries where they do 
those things, namely, that they were infected too, and died by hundreds and 

thousands? ^ ^ j ^ i. 

I would be far from lessening the awe of the judgments of God and tw 
reverence to His providence, which ought always to be on our minds on sucdi 
occasions as these. Doubtless the visitation itself is a stroke from Heaven 
a city, or country, or nation where it falls; a messenger of His v^geance, and 
a bud caU to that nation, or country, or city to humiUatton and repentanc^ 
according to that of the prophet Jeremiah (xviii. 7 , 8 ): At what instant I 
shall speak concerning a nation, and concerni^ a kingdom, to pluck «P. 
to pufl down, and w destroy it; that

unto them.” Now to prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the mioiii 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

d men on such occarions, and not to lessen them, it is that I have left those 
minutes upon record. 

I say, therefore, I reflect upon no man for putting the reason of those things 
upon the immediate hand of God, and the appointment and direction of His 
providence; nay, on the contrary, there were many wonderful deliverances of 
persons from infection, and deliverances of persons when infected, which 
mtimate singular and remarkable providence in the particular instances to 
which they refer, and I esteem my own deliverance to be one next to mirac- 
ulous, and do record it with thanlaulness. 

But when I am speaking of the plague as a distemper arising fronk natural 
causes, we must consider it as it was really propagated by natural mmns; nor 
is it at all the less a judgment for its being under ^e conduct of human causes 
and effects; for, as the Divine Power has formed the whole scheme oi nature 
and maintains nature in its course, so the same Power thinks fit to let His own 
actings with men, whether of mercy or judgment, to go on in the oqlinary 
course of natural causes, and He is pleased to act by those natural causes as die 
ordinary means, excepting and reserving to Himself nevertheless a power to 
act in a supernatural way when He sees occasion. Now ’tis evident that in the 
case of an infection there is no apparent extraordinary occasion for super- 
natural operation, but the ordinary course of things appears sufficiendy armed, 
and made capable of all the effects that Heaven usually directs by a contagion. 
Among these causes and effects, this of the secret conveyance of infection, 
imperceptible and unavoidable, is more than sufficient to execute the fierteness 
of Divine vengeance, without putting it upon supernaturals and miracle. 

The acute penetrating nature of the disease itself was such, and the infection 
was received so imperceptibly, that the most exact caution could not secure 
us while in the place. But I must be allowed to believe-and I have so many 
examples fresh in my memory to convince me of it, that I think none can 
retist their evidence— I say, I must be allowed to believe that no one in this 
whole nation ever received the sickness or infection but who received it in the 
ordinary way of infection from somebody, or the clothes, or touch, or stench 
of somebody that was infected before. 

The manner of its coming first to London proves this also, viz., by goods 
brought over from Hollano, and brought thither from the levant, the first 
breakup of it out in a house in Long Acre where those goods were carried md 
first opened, its spreading from that house to other houses by the visible 
unwary conversing with those who were sick, and the infecting the parish 
officers who were employed about the persons dead, ^nd the like. These are 
known authorities for this great foundiion point^ that it went on and pro- 
ceeded from person to person and from house to house, and no otherwise. In 
the fiirst house that was infected there died four persons. A neighbour, hearing 
the mistress of the first house was sick, went to visit her, and went home and 
gave tiie distemper to her family, and died, and all her household. A minister, 
calle4,to pray with the first sick person in ffie second house, was said to sicken 
immediately, and die with several more in his house. Then the physicians began 
to consider, for tJwy did not at first dream of a general contagion. But the 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR M 

phjracians being sent to inspect the bodies, they assured the people that it 
vjras neither more or less than the plague, with all its terrifying particulars, and 
that it threatened an universal infection, so many people having already con- 
versed with the sick or distempered, ^nd having, as might be supposed, received 
infection from them, that it would be impossible to put a stop to it. 

Here the opinion of the physicians agreed with my observation afterwards, 
namely, that the danger was spreading insensibly, for the sick could infect 
none but those that came within reach of the sick person, but that one man 
who may have really received the infection and knows it not, but goes abroad 
and about as a sound person, may give the plague to a thousand people, and 
they to greater numbers in proportion, and neither the person giving the infec- 
tion or the persons receiving it know anything of it, and perhaps not feel the 
effects of it for several days after. 

For example, many persons in the time of this visitation never perceived that 
they were infected till they found, to their unspeakable surprise, the tokens 
come out upon them; after which they seldom lived six hours, for those spots 
they called the tokens were really gangrene spots, or mortified flesh in small 
knobs as broad as a little silver penny, and hard as a piece of callus or horn; 
so that, when the disease was come up to that length, there was nothing could 
follow but certain death, and yet, as I said, they knew nothing of their being 
infected, nor found themselves so much as out of order, till those mortal 
were upon them. But everybody must aUow that they were infected m a high 
degree before, and must have been so some time, and consequently their breath, 
thSr sweat, their very clothes, were contagious for many days before. 

This occasioned a vast variety of cases, which physicians would have much 
more opportunity to remember than 1; but some came within the compass o 
mv observation or hearing, of which I shall name a few.

Slid somechiM to himself; at whidi the first citizen turned pafe, mi said 
HD more but mis, *^Then I am a dead man too,’* and went home immediately 
and sent for a neighbouring apothecary to give him something preventive, 
for he had imt yet found himself ill; but. the apothecary, opening his breast, 
fetched a sigh, and said no more but this, *^Look up to God;” and the man 
died in a few hours. 

Now let any man judge from a case like this if it is possible for the regula- 
tions of magistrates, either by shutting up the sick or removing them, to stop 
an infection which spreads itself from man to man, even while they /are per- 
fectly well and insensible of its approach, and may be so for many days. 

It may be proper to ask here how long it may be supposed men might have 
the seeds of the contagion in them before it discovered itself in mis fatal 
manner, and how long they might go about seemingly whole, and Wet be 
contagious to all those that came near them. I believe the most experienced 
physicians cannot answer this question directly any more than I can; and 
something an ordinary observer may take notice of, which may pass their 
observation. The opinion of physicians abroad seems to be that it may lie 
dormant in the spirits, or in the blood-vessels, a very considerable time. Why 
else do they exact a quarantine of those who come into their harbours and 
ports from suspected places? Forty days is, one would think, too long for 
nature to struggle with such an enemy as this, and not conquer it or yield to 
it But I could not think, by my own observation, that they can be infected 
so as to be contagious to others above fifteen or sixteen days at furthest; and 
on that score it was, that when a house was shur up in the city, and any one 
had died of the plague, but nobody appeared to be ill in the family for six- 
teen or eighteen days after, they were not so strict but that they would 
connive at their going privately abroad; nor would people be much afraid of 
them srfterward, but rather think they were fortified the better, having not 
been vulnerable when the enemy was in their own house; but we sometimes 
found it had lain much longer concealed. 

Upon the foot of all these observations I must say, that though Providence 
seemed to direct my conduct to be otherwise, yet it is my opinion, and I 
must leave it as a prescription, viz., that the best physic agamst the plague is 
to run away from it. I know people encourage themselves by saying God is 
able to keep us in the midst of danger, and able to overtake us when we think 
ourselves out of danger; and this kept thousands in the town, whose carcasses 
went into the great pits by cartloads, and who, if they had fled from the 
danger, had, I believe, been safe from the disaster; at least ’tis probable they 
had been safe. ^ 

And were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people on 
any future occasion of this or the like nature, I am persuaded it would put 
them upon quite different measures for managing the people from those tnat 
toult in 1665, ^ taxen atooad that I have heard 

of* In a word, they would consider of separating the people into smaller 
bodied, and removing them in time farther from one another, and not let 



A JOOTNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR m 

^ch ft ibDn^ftgton as this, which is indeed chiefly daxu^ons to ccfllected bodki 
of people, find a million of p^ple in a body tc^^er, as was very near the 
case before, and would certainly be the case if it should ever appear agaiie* 
The plague, like a great fire, if a. few houses only are contiguous where it 
happens, can only burn a few houses; or if it begins in a single, or, as we caH 
it, a lone house, can only burn that lone house where it begins* But if it 
begins in a close-built town or city and gets a head, there its fury increases, 
it rages over the whole place, and consumes all it can reach. 

I could propose many schemes on the foot of which the government of 
this city, if ever they should be under the apprehensions of such another 
enemy (God forbid they should), might ease themselves of the greatest part 
of the dangerous people that bdong to them; I mean such as the beggmg, 
starving, labouring poor, and among them chiefly those who, in case of a 
siege, are called the useless mouths, who being then prudently and to their 
own advantage disposed of, and the wealthy inhabitants disposing of themr 
selves, and of dieir servants and children, the city and its adjacent parts woxfld 
be so effectually evacuated that there would not be above a tenth part of its 
people left together for the disease to take hold upon. But suppose them to 
be a fifth part, and that two hundred and fifty thousand people were left, 
and if it did seize upon them, they would, by their living so much at larg^ 
be much better prepared to defend themselves against the infection, and be 
less liable to the e^cts of it than if the same number of people lived dose 
together in one smaller city, such as Dublin or Amsterdam, or the like. 

It is true hundreds, yea, thousands of families fled away at this tet 
but then, of them, many fled too late, and not only died in their flight, hxxt 
carried the distemper with them into the countries whMe they wenl^ ^ 
infected those whom they went among for safety; ‘:onfo«mded ^

and ^dier fofwurd to do it than not; and I believe it was pardy firm 
this very thing that they raised that suggestion, which I hope was not red^ 
true in fact. 

I confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a general, but 1 could name 
several people within the knowledge of some of their neighbours and families 
yet living who, showed the contrary to an extreme. One man, a master of a 
family in my neighbourhood, having had the distemper, he thought he had 
it given him by a poor workman whom he employed, and whom he went to 
his house to see, or went for some work that he wanted to have finished, and 
he had some apprehensions even while he was at the poor workman’s door, 
but did not discover it fuUy; but the next day it discovered itself, anj 
taken very ill, upon which he immediately caused himself to be car» 
an outbuilding which he had in his yard, and where there was a 
over a workhouse, the man being a brazier. Here he lay, and here 
and would be tended by none of his neighbours, but by a nurse from ^ 
and would not suffer his wife, nor children, nor servants to come up inVo the 
room, lest they should be infected, but sent them his blessing and prayers 
for them by the nurse, who spoke it to them at a distance, and all this for fear 
of giving them the distemper, and without which he knew, as they were kept 
up, they could not have it. 

And here I must observe also that the plague, as I suppose all distempers do, 
operated in a different manner on differing constitutions; some were imme- 
diately overwhelmed with it, and it came to violent fevers, vomitings, insuffer- 
able headaches, pains in the back, and so up to ravings and ragings with those 
pains; others with swellings and tumours in the neck or groin, or armpits, 
which till they could be broke put them into insufferable agonies and torment; 
while others, as I have observed, were silently infected, the fever preying 
upon their spirits insensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell into 
swooning, and faintings, and death without pain. 

I am not physician enough to enter into the particular reasons and manner 
of these differing effects of one and the same distemper, and of its differing 
operation in several bodies; nor is it my business here m record the observa- 
tions which I really made, because the doctors themselves have done that part 
much more effectually than I can do, and because my opinion may in some 
things differ from theirs. I am only relating what I Imow, or have heard, or 
believe of the particular cases, and what feu within the compass of my view, 
and the different nature of the infection, as it appeared in the particular cases 
which I have related; but this may be added too, that though the former sort 
of those cases, namely, those openly visited, were tfic worst for themselves 
as to pain-^I mean those that had such fevers, vomitings, headaches, pains, and 
swellings, because they died in such a dreadful manner— yet the latter had 
th^ worst state of the disease; for in the former they frequently recovered, 
^pe^jally if the swellings broke, but die latter was inevitable death; no cure, 
could be possible, nothing could follow but death. 

Apd it was worse also to others, because, as above, it secretly, and unpef- 
ccived by others, or by themselves, communicated death to those they con-

versed the pwictratiiffi poison insinuating itself into thdr bbod b a' 
naanner which it is impossible to describe, or mdeed conceive 
TTiis infecong and being infected without so much as its 'being known to 
eithw pipwn is evident from two sorts of cases which frequent happened 
at that time; and there is hardly anybody Uving who was in London ^kig 
the infection but must have known several of the cases of both sorts# 

1. FaAem and mothers have gone about as if they had been well, and have 
believed theniselves to be so, till they have insensibly infected and been the 
destruction of their whole families, which they would have been far from 
doing if they had the least apprehensions of their being unsound and danger- 
ous themselves, A family, whose story I have heard, was thus infected by 
the father;^ and the distemper began to appear upon some of them even before 
he found it upon himself. But searching more narrowly, it appeared he had 
been affected some time, and as soon as he found that his family had been 
poisoned by himself he went distracted, and would have laid violent hands 
upon himself, but was kept from that by those who looked to him, and in a 
few days died. 

2 . The other particular is, that many people having been well to the best 
of their own judgment, or by the best observation which they could make 
of themselves for several days, and only finding a decay of appetite, or a light 
sickness upon their stomachs; some whose appetite has been strong, and 
even craving, and only a light pain in their heads, have sent for physicians to 
know what ailed them, and have been found, to their great surprise, at the 
brink of death, the tokens upon them, or the plague grown up to an incur- 
able height. 

It was very sad to reflect how such a person as this last mentioned above 
had been a walking destroyer perhaps for a week or a fortnight before that; 
how he had ruined those that he would have hazarded his life to save, and 
had been breathing death upon them, even perhaps in his tender kissing and 
embracings of his own children. Yet thus certainly it was, and often has been, 
and I could give many particular cases where it has been so. If then the blow 
is thus insensibly striking, if the arrow flies thus unseen, and cannot be dis- 
covered, to what purpose are all the schemes for shutting up or removing 
the sick people? Those schemes cannot take place but upon those that appear 
to be sick, or to be infected; whereas there are among them at the same 
time thousands of people who seem to be well, but are all that while carrying 
death with them into all companies which they come into. 

This frequently puzzled our physicians, and especially the apothecaries and 
surgeons, who knew not how to discover the sick from the sound; they ai 
allowed that it was really so, that many people had the plague in their very 
blood, and preying npon their spirits, and were in thepclvcs but walkina 
putrefied caJea^esf wfiose breath was infectious and dieir 
yet were as well to look on as other people, 

I say, they all allowed that it was really true m fact, but they knew not how 
“l5y ?Sd was of opinion that it might be known by the smeU 



m WORKS DAmt DE3^ 

<»f dldr bresdt; tint dieo, as he said, who ^dorst smell to that (ureath lor his 
kfoirmatbn? wee, tx> know it, he must draw the stench of the ph^e up 
his own brain, in order to disdn^ish the smell! I have heard it was the 
opinion of odiers that it might be distmguished by the party’s breathing upon 
a piece of glass, where, the breath condensing, there might living creatures 
be seen by a microscope, of strange, monstrous, and fr&htful shapes, such 
as dragons, shakes, serpents, and devils, horrible to behold. But this 1 very 
much question the truth of, and we had no microscopes at that time, as I 
remember, to make the experiment with. / 

It was the opinion also of another learned man, that the breath pf such a 
person would poison and instantly kill a bird; not only a small bird, \ but even 
a cock or hen, and that, if it did not immediately idll the latter, at would 
cause them to be roupy, as they call it; particularly that if they haduaid any 
eggs at any time, they would be all rotten. But those are opinions phich I 
never found supported by any experiments, or heard of others that had seen 
it; so I leave them as I find them, only with this remark, namely, that I think 
the probabilities are very strong for them. 

Some have proposed that such persons should breathe hard upon warm 
water, and that they would leave an unusual scum upon it, or upon several 
odber things, especially such as are of a glutinous substance and are apt to 
receive a scum and support it. 

But from the whole I found that the nature of this contagion was such that 
it was impossible to discover it at all, or to prevent its spreading from one 
to another by any human skill. 

Here was indeed one diificulty which I could never thoroughly get over 
to this time, and which there is but one way of answering that 1 know of, and 
it is this, viz., the first person that died or the plague was on December 20, 
or thereabouts, 1664, and in or about Long Acre; whence the first person 
had the infection was generally said to be, from a parcel of silks imported from 
Holland, and first opened in that house. 

But after this we heard no more of any person dying of the plague, or of 
the distemper being in that place, till the 9th of February, which was about 
seven weeks after, and then one more was buried out of the same house. Then 
k was hushed, and we were perfectly easy as to the public for a great while; 
for there were no more entered in tlie weekly bill to be dead of the plague till 
the 22nd of April, when there was two more buried, not out of the same house, 
tmt out of the same street; and, as near as I can remember, it was out of the 
next house to the first. This was nine weeks asunder, and after this we had 
no more till a fortnight, and then it broke out in several streets, and spread 
every way. Now the question seems to lie thus: Where lay the seeds of the 
infection all this while? How came it to stop so long, and not stop any longer? 
Ei^er the distemper did not come immcmatcly by contagion from body to 
or if it did, then a body may be capable to continue infected without 
the disease discovering itself many days, nay, weeks together; even not a 
i^aarantiiie of days omy, but soixantine; not only forty days, but sixty days 
4 r longer. 



A j(5urnal of the plague year m 

It is true there was, as I observed at first, and is weU known to manv vet 

'aY .'^'Wch continued three months, 

inight check the infection; but then the learned 
most allow me to say, that if, accqrdmg to their notion, the disease was, as 
I may say, only frozen up, it would, like a frozen river, have returned to its 
usual force and current when it thawed, whereas the principal recess of this 
infwoon, winch was from February to April, was after the ffost was broken 
and the weather mild and warm. 


But Aere is another way of solving all this difficulty, which I think my own 
remembrance of the thing wiU supply; and that is, the fact is not granted, 
namely, that there died none in those long intervals, viz., from the 20th of 
December to the 9th of February, and from thence to the 22nd of April. The 
weekly bills are the only evidence on the other side, and those bills were not 
of credit enough, at least with me, to support an hypothesis or determine a 
question of such importance as this; for it was our received opinion at that 
time, and I believe upon very good grounds, that the fraud lay in the parish 
officers, searchers, and persons appointed to give account of the dead, and 
what diseases they died of; and as people were very loth at jSrst to have the 
neighbours believe their houses were infected, so they gave money to procure, 
or otherwise procured, the dead persons to be returned as dying of other 
distempers; and this I know was practised afterwards in many places, I believe 
1 might say in all places where the distemper came, as will be seen by the vast 
increase of the numbers placed in the weekly bills under other articles of 
diseases during the time of the infection. For example, in the months of July 
and August, when the plague was coming on to its highest pitch, it was very 
ordinary to have from a thousand to twelve hundred, nay, to almost fifteen hun- 
dred a week of other distempers. Not that the numbers of those distempers were 
really increased to such a degree, but the great number of families and houses 
where really the infection was, obtained the favour to have their dead be 
returned 0/ other distempers, to prevent the shutting up their houses. For 
example:—

There were several other articles which bore a proportion to the^, and 
which, it is easy to perceive, were increased on the same account, as aged, 
consumptions, vomitings, imposthumes, gripes, and the like, many of which 
were not doubted to be infected people; but as it was of the utmost conse- 
quence to families not to be known to be infected, if it was possible to avoid 
it, so tfiey took all the measures they could to have it not believed, and if any 
died in their houses, to get them returned to the examiners, and by the 
searchers, as having died of other distempers. 

This, I say, will account for the long interval which, as I have sdd, was 
between the dying of the first persons that were returned in the bill to be 
dead of die plague and the time when the distemper spread openly and could 
not be concealed. 

Besides, the weekly bills themselves at that time evidently discovered this 
truth; for, while there was no mention of the plague, and no increase after it 
bad been mentioned, yet it was apparent that there was an increase of those 
distempers which bordered nearest upon it; for example, there were eight, 
twelve, seventeen of the spotted fever in a week, when there were none, or 
but very few, of the plague; whereas before, one, three, or four were the 
ordinary weekly numbers of that distemper. Likewise, as I observed before, 
the bumls increased weekly in that particular parish and the parishes adjacent 
more than in any odier parish, although there were none set down of the 
l^gue; all which tell us, that the infection was handed on, and the succession 
of the distemper really preserved, though it seemed to us at that time to be

It might be, also, that the infection might remain in other parts of the

pMimer from persons apparently weU, they began to be exceeding 

0«“- «“ » public day, wh4er a 
Sabbath-day or not I do not remember, in Adgate Chirch, in /pew fuH of 
people, on a sudden one fancied she smelt an ill smeU, Immediately she fancies 
die plaroe was in the pew, whispers her notion or suspicion to the next, then 
rises and goes out of the pew. It immediately took with the next, and so tt> 
them al4 and every one oi them, and of the two or three adjoining pews, got 
up and went out of the church, nobody knowing what it was offended thStt* 
or from whom. 

This immediately filled everybody’s mouths with one preparation or other, 
such as the old 'women directed, and some perhaps as physicians directed, in 
order to prevent infection by the breath of others, insomuch that if we came 
to go into a church when it was anything full of people, there would be such 
a mixture of smells at the entrance that it was much more strong, though 
perhaps not so wholesome, than if you were going into an apothecary’s or 
druggist’s shop. In a word, the whole church was like a smelling-bottle; m one 
comer it was all perfumes; in another, aromatics, balsamics, and variety of 
drugs and herbs; in another, salts and spirits, as every one was furnished for 
their own preservation. Yet I observed that after people were possessed, as 
I have said, with the belief, or rather assurance, of the infection being thus 
carried on by persons apparently in health, the churches and meeting-houses 
were much thinner of people than at other times before that they used to be. 
For rfiis is to be said of the people of London, that during the whole time 
of the pestilence the churches or meetings were never wholly shut up, not 
did the people decline coming out to the public worship of God, except only 
m some parishes when the violence of the distemper was more particularly in 
that parish at that time, and even then no longer than it continued to be so. 

Indeed nothing was more strange than to see with what courage the people 
went to the public service of God even at that time, when they were afraid 
to stir out of their own houses upon any other occasion; this, I mean, before 
the time of desperation, which I have mentioned ^ready. This was a proof 
of the exceeding populousness of the city at the time of the infection, not** 
withstanding the great numbers that were gone into the country at the mst 
alarm, and that fled out into the forests and woods when they were furtl^ 
terrified with the extraordinary increase of it. For when “

churches, and especially in those parts of the town where the mague

of mfec ting one another. People were only shy of those t^t were 
sick, a man with a cap upon Im head, or w^ clothes round his neck, which 



WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

was tJie case of those that had swellings there. Such was indeed frightful; 
but wh^ we saw a gentleman dressed, with his band on and his gloves in his 
hand, his hat upon his head, and his hair combed, of such we had not the 
lea^ apprehensions, and people conversed a great while freely, especially with 
dieir neighbours and such as they knew. But when the physicians assured 
us that the danger was as well from the sound, that is, the seemingly sound, 
as the sick, and that those people who thought themselves entirely free were 
oftentimes the most fatal, and that it came to be generally understood that 
people were sensible of it, and of the reason of it; then, I say, they .began to 
DC jealous of everybody, and a vast number of people locked themselves up, 
so as not to come abroad into any company at all, nor suffer any thatlhad been 
abroad in promiscuous company to come into their houses, or neW them, 
at least not so near them as to be within the reach of their breath or of any 
smell from them; and when diey were obliged to converse at a distai^e with 
strangers, they would always have preservatives in their mouths and about 
their clothes to repel and keep off the infection. 

It must be acknowledged that when people began to use these cautions 
they were less exposed to danger, and the infection did not break into such 
houses so furiously as it did into others before; and thousands of families were 
preserved, speaking with due reserve to the direction of Divine Providence, 
by that means. 

But it was impossible to beat anything into the heads of the poor. They 
went on with the usual impetuosity of their tempers, full of outcries and 
lamentations when taken, but madly careless of themselves, foolhardy and 
obstinate, while they were well. Where they could get employment they 
pushed into any kind of business, the most dangerous and the most liable to 
infection; and if they were spoken to, their answer would be, “I must trust to 
God for that; if I am taken, then I am provided for, and there is an end of 
me,” and the like. Or thus, “Why, what must I do? I can’t starve. I had as 

f ood have the plague as perish for want. I have no work; what could I do? 

must do this or beg.” Suppose it was burying the dead, or attending the 
dok, or watching infected houses, which were all terrible hazards; but their 
tale was generally the same. It is true, necessity was a very justifiable, warrant- 
able plea, and nothing could be better; but their way of talk was much the 
aame where the necessities were not the same. This adventurous conduct 
of the poor was that which brought the plague among them in a most furious 
manner, and this, joined to the distress of their circumstances when taken, 
was the reason why they died so by heaps; for I cannot say I could observe 
one jot of better husbandry among them, I mean the labouring poor, wWle 
lincy were all well and getting money than there was before, but as lavish, 
as extravagant, and as thoughtless for to-morrow as ever; so that when they 
came to be taken sick they were immediately in the utmost distress, as well 
for want as for sickness, as well for lack of food as lack of health. 

This misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eye-wimess of, and 
sometimes also of the charitable assistance that some pious people daily gaVe 
to such, sending them relief and supplies both of food, physic, and other help.

as they found they wanted; and indeed it is a debt of justice due to the 
temper of the people of that day to take notice here, that not only great sums, 
very great sums of money were charitably sent to the Lord Mayor and alder-^ 
men for the assistance and support of the poor distempered people, but 
abundance of private people daily distributed large sums of money for thw 
relief, and sent people about to inquire into the condition of particular dis- 
tressed and visited families, and relieved them; nay, some piqus ladies were 
so transported with zeal in so good a work, and so confident in the protection 
of Providence in discharge of the great duty of charity, that they went about 
in person distributing alms to the poor, and even visiting poor families, though 
sick and infected, in their very houses, appointing nurses to attend those that 
wanted attending, and ordering apothecaries and surgeons, the first to supply 
them with drugs or plaisters, and such things as they wanted; and the last 
to lance and dress the swellings and tumours, where such were wanting; 
giving their blessing to the poor in substantial relief to them, as well as hearty

move the hearts of the people in all parts of die kinf dom so dieerfn]l3r to con- 
tribute to the relief and support of the poor at London, the good consequences 
of which were felt many ways, and particularly in preserving the lives and 
recovering the health of so many thousands, and keeping so many thousands 
of families from perishing and starving. * 

And now I am talking of the merciful disposition of Providence in this time 
of calamity, I cannot but mention again, though I have spoken several times 
of it already on other accounts, I mean that of the progression of the dis- 
temper; how it began at one end of the town, and proceeded gradually and 
dowly from one part to another, and like a dark cloud that passes o^cr our 
heads, which, as it thickens and overcasts the air at one end, clears up at the 
other end; so, while the plague went on raging from west to east, as k went 
forwards east, it abated in the west, by which means those parts of the town 
which were not seized, or who were left, and where it had spent its furyi were 
(as it were) spared to help and assist the other; whereas, had the distemper 
spread itself over the whole city and suburbs at once, raging in all places 
alike, as it has done since in some places abroad, the whole body of the people 
must have been overwhelmed, and there would have died twenty thousand 
a day, as they say there did at Naples; nor would the people have been able 
to have helped or assisted one another. 

For it must be observed that where the plague was in its full force, there 
indeed the people were very miserable, and the consternation was inexpressible. 
But a little before it reached even to that place, or presently after it was gone, 
they were quite another sort of people; and I cannot but acknowledge^ that 
there was too much of that common temper of mankind to be found among 
us all at that time, namely, to forget the deliverance when the danger is past. 
But I shall come to speak of that part again. 

It must not be forgot here to take some notice of the state of trade during 
the time of this common calamity, and this with respect to foreign trade, as 
also to our home trade. 

As to foreign trade, there needs little to be said. The trading nations of 
Europe were all afraid of us; no port of France, or Holland, or Spain, or 
Italy would admit our ships or correspond with us; indeed we stood on ill 
terms with the Dutch, and were in a furious war with them, but though in a 
bad condition to fight abroad, who had such dreadful enemies to struggle with 
at home. 

Our merchants were accordingly at a full stop; their ships could go no- 
where, that is to say, to no place abroad; their manufactures and merchandise, 
that is to say, of our growth, would not be touched abroad. They were as 
much afraid of our goods as they were of our people; and indeed they had 
reason, for our woollen manufactures are as retentive of infection as human 
bodies, and if packed up by persons infected, would receive the infection, and 
be as dangerous to touch as a man would be that was infected; and therefore, 
when aify English vessel arrived in foreign countries, if they did take the 
goods on shore, they always caused the bales to be opened and aired in places 
appoir^ for that purpose. But from London they would not suffer them 



A JOURNAL OF THE FLA60E YEAR 4# 

to come into port, much le$$ to unlade their goods, upon any terms whatever; 
and this strictness was especially used with them m Spain and Italy. In Turi^, 
and the islands of the Arches indeed, as they are called, as well those belonging 
to the Turks as to the Venetians, they were not so very rigid. In the first 
there was no obstruction at all; and four ships which were then in the river 
loading for Italy, that is, for Leghorn and Naples, being denied product, ^ 
they call it, went on to Turkey, and were freely admitted jto unlade the^ 
cargo without any difficulty, only that when they arrived there, some of their 
cargo was not fit for sale in that counny, and other parts of it being coiisigned 
to merchants at Leghorn, the captains of the ships had no right nor any 
orders to dispose of the goods; so that great inconveniences followed to the 
merchants. But this was nothing but what the necessity of affairs required, 
and the merchants at Leghorn and Naples having notice given them, sent 
again from thence to take care of the effects, which were particularly con- 
signed to those ports, and to bring back in other ships such as were improper 
for the markets at Smyrna and Scanderoon. 

The inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were still greater, for they would 
by no means suffer our ships, especially those from London, to come into 
any of their ports, much less to unlade. There was a report that one of our 
ships having by stealth delivered her cargo, among which was some bales of 
English cloth, cotton, kerseys, and such-like goods, the Spaniards caused all 
the goods to be burned, and punished the men with death who were concerned 
in carrying them on shore. This, I believe, was in part true, though I do not 
affirm it; but it is not at all unlikely, seeing the danger was really very great, 
the infection being so violent in London. 

I heard, likewise, that the plague was carried into those countries by some 
of our ships, and particularly to the port of Faro, in the kingdom of Algarve, 
belonging to the King of Portugal, and that several persons died of it there, 
but it was not confirmed. 

On the other hand, though the Spaniards and Portuguese were so shy of 
us, it is most certain that the plague, as has been said, keeping at first much 
at that end of the town next Westminster, the merchandising part of die 
town, such as the city and the water-side, was perfectly sound ml at least the 
beginning of July, and the ships in the river till the beginning of August; 
for to the ist of July there had died but seven within the whole city, and but 
sixty within the liberties, but one in all the parishes of Stepney, Aldgate, and 
Wmtcchapel, and but two in all the eight parishes of Southwark. But it was 
the same thing abroad, for the bad news was gone over the whole world that 
the dty of London was infected with the plague, and there was no inquiries 
there how the infection proceeded, or at which part of the town it was be^u 

or was reached to. i. * . * .,1 

Besides, after it began to spread it increased so fast, and the bills grew so 
high all on a sudden, that it was to no purjjose to lessen the report of it, ot 
endeavour to make the people abroad think it better than it was; the accoum 
which the weekly bills gave in was sufficient; ^d that there died two ihoiiaaud 
to thiec or four thousand a week was sufficient to alarm the whole tra^ng 



m WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 

jfnxt of the world, and the following time being so dreadful also in the very 
city itself put the whole world, I say, upon their guard against it 

You may be sure, also, that the report of these things lost nothing in the 
carriage. TTie plague was itself very terrible, and the distress of the people 
very great, as you may observe of what I have said. But the rumour was 
infinitely greater, and it must not be wondered that our friends abroad, as my 
brother’s corr^ondents in particular were told there, namely, in Portugal 
and Italy, where he chiefly traded, [said] that in London there died twenty 
thousand in a week; that the dead bodies lay unburied by heaps; that the living 
were not suflScient to bury the dead or the sound to look after the si^k; that 
all the kingdom was infected likewise, so that it was an universal malady, 
such as was never heard of in those parts of the world; and they could\ hardly 
believe us when we gave them an account how things really were, aim how 
there was not above one-tenth part of the people dead; that there was ioo,ooo 
left that lived all the time in the town; that now the people began to\ walk 
the streets again, and those who were fled to return, there was no miss of 
the usual throng of people in the streets, except as every family might miss 
their relations and neighbours, and the like. I say they could not believe 
these things; and if inquiry were now to be made in Naples, or in other cities 
on the coast of Italy, they would tell you that there was a dreadful infection 
in London so many years ago, in which, as above, there died twenty thousand 
in a week, &c., just as we have had it reported in London that there was a 
plague in the city of Naples in the year 1656, in which there died 20,000 people 
m a day, of which I have had very good satisfaction that it was utterly false. 

But mese extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade, as well as 
unjust and injurious in themselves, for it was a long time after the plague was 
quite over before our trade could recover itself in those parts of the world; 
and the Flemings and Dutch, but especially the last, made very great advan- 
tages of it, having all the market to themselves, and even buying our manu- 
factures in several parts of England where the plague was not, and carrying 
them to Holland and Flanders, and from thence transporting them to Spain 
and to Italy, as if they had been of their own making. 

But they were detected sometimes and punished, that is to say, their goods 
confiscated, and ships also; for if it was true that our manufactures as well as 
our people were infected, and that it was dangerous to touch or to open and 
receive the smell of them, then those people ran the hazard by that clandestine 
trade, not only of carrying the contagion into their own country, but also 
of infecting the nations to whom they traded with those goods, which, con- 
sidering how many lives might be lost in consequence of such an action, must 
be a trade that no men of conscience could suffer themselves to be concerned in. 

I do not take upon me to say that any harm was done, I mean of that kind, 
by those people. But I doubt I need not make any such proviso in the case 
of our own country; for either by our people of London, or by the commerce 
which made their conversing with all sorts of people in every county and of 
every considerable town necessary, I say, by this means the plague was first 
or last spread all over the kingdom, as well in London as in ^ the cities and

great towns, especially in the trading manufacturing towns and seaports; so 
that, first or last, all the considerable places in England were visited more or 
less, and the kingdom of Ireland in some places, but not so universally. How 
it fared with the people in Scotland J had no opportunity to inquire. 

It is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent in London, 
the outports, as they are called, enjoyed a very great trade, especially to the 
adjacent countries and to our own plantations. For example,® the tovms of 
G>lchester, Yarmouth, and Hull, on that side of England, exported to Holland 
and Hamburg the manufactures of the adjacent counties for several months 
after the trade with London was, as it were, entirely shut up; likewise the 
cities of Bristol and Exeter, with the port of Plymouth, had the like advantage 
to Spain, to the Canaries, to Guinea, and to the West Indies, and particularly 
to Ireland; but as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in 
London to such a degree as it was in August and September, so all, or most 
of those cities and towns, were infected first or last, and then trade was, as 
it were, under a general embargo, or at a full stop, as I shall observe further 
when 1 speak of our home trade. 

One thing, however, must be observed, that as to ships coming in from abroad, 
as many you may be sure did, some who were out in all parts of the world 
a considerable while before, and some who when they went out knew nothing 
of an infection, or at least of one so terrible; these came up the river boldly, 
and delivered their cargoes as they were obliged to do, except just in the wo 
months of August and September, when the weight of the infection lying, 
as I may say, all below Bridge, nobody durst appear in business for a while. 
But as this continued but for a few weeks, the homeward-bound ships, espe- 
cially such whose cargoes were not liable to spoil, came to an anchor lor 
a time, short of the Pool,® or freshwater part of the river, even as low as the 
river Medway, where several of them ran in, and others lay at the Nore, and 
in the Hope below Gravesend. So that by the latter end of October there 
was a very great ficet of homeward-bound ships to come up, such as the like 
had not been known for many years. 

Two particular trades were carried on by water-carriage all the while of 
the infection, and that with little or no interruption, very much to the advan** 
tage and comfort of the poor distressed people of the city, and those were 
the coasting trade for corn and the Newcastle trade for coals. 

The first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels from the port 
of Hull and other places on the Humber, by which great quantities of com 
were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The other part of this corn- 
trade was from Lynn, in Norfolk, from Wells and Burnham, and from Yar- 
mouth, all in the same county; and the third branch was from the river Med- 
way, and from Milton, Feversham, Margate, and Sandwich, and all the other 
little places and ports round the coa^ of Kent and Essex. ^ 

There was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with com, butter, 

•That part of the river where the ships lie up when they come home is called 
the Pool, and takes in all the river on both sides of the water, from the Tower to 
Cuckold’s Point and Limehouse. 



m 


WORKS OF DANIEL DEFOE 


Mad cheese; these vessels kept a constant course of trade, and without inter* 
mption cmc up to that market known still by the name of Bear Key, where 
meiy supplied the city plentifully with com when land-carriage began to fail, and 
when the people began to be sick of coming from many places in the country. 

This also was, much of it, owing to the prudence and conduct of the I^rd 
Mayor, who took such care to keep the masters and seamen from danger 
when they cafiie up, causit^ their com to be bought off at any time they 
wanted a market (which, however, was very seldom), and causing the corn- 
factors immediately to unlade and deliver the vessels loaden with corn, that 
they had very little occasion to come out of their ships or vessels, the[ money 
being always carried on board to them, and put into a pail of vinegar Dipfore it 
was carried. 

The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 
which the city would have been greatly distressed; for not in the stree 

but in private houses and families, great quantities of coals were then ^ , 

even all the summer long, and when the weather was hottest, which was 'done 
by the advice of the physicians. Some indeed opposed it, and insisted that to 
keep the houses and rooms hot was a means to propagate the distemper, which 
was a fermentation and heat already in the blood; that it was known to spread 
and increase in hot weather, and abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that 
all contagious distempers are the worse for heat, because the contagion was 
nourished and gained strength in hot weather, and was, as it were, propagated 
in heat. 

Others said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate infection, 
as sultry, hot weatner fills the air with vermin and nourishes innumerable 
numbers and kinds of venomous creatures, which breed in our food, in the 
plants, and even in our bodies, by the very stench of which infection may be 
propagated; also, that heat in the air, or heat of weather, as we ordinarily 
call it, makes bodies relax and faint, exhausts the spirits, opens the pores, and 
makes us more apt to receive infection, or any evil influence, be it from noxious 
pestilential vapours, or any other thing in the air; but that the heat of fire, 
and especially of coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, had a quite different 
operation, the heat being not of the same kind, but quick and nerce, tending 
not to nourish but to consume and dissmate ^1 those noxious fumes which 
the other kind of heat rather exhaled ana stagnated than separated and burnt 
im. Besides, it was alleged that the sulphurous and nitrous particles that are 
oiten found to be in the coal, with that bituminous substance which burns, are 
all assisting to clear and purge the air, and render it wholesome and safe to 
breathe in, after the noxious particles, as above, are dispersed and burnt up. 

The latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as I must confess, 1 think with 
good reason, and the experience of the citizens confirmed it, many houses which 
constant fires kept in the rooms having never been infected at all; and 
join my experience to it, for I found the keeping good fires kept our 
Jhmxm sweet and wholesome, and I do verily believe made our whole fanuly 
more than would otherwise have been. 

, But 1 return to the coals as a trade. It was with no little difficulty that this

trade was kept open, and particularly because, as we were in an open war 
widi the Dutch at that time, the Dutch capers at first took a great many of 
our collier-ships, which made the rest cautious, and made them to stay to 
come in fleets together. But after some time the capers were either afraid 
to take them, or their masters, the States, were afraid they should, and forbade 
them, lest the plague should be among them, which made them fare the better^ 

For the security of those northern traders, the coal-ships were ordered by 
my Lord M^or not to come up into the Pool above a certain number at a 
time, and ordered lighters and other vessels, such as the wood-mongers, that 

is, the wharf-keepers or coal-sellers, furnished, to go down and take out the 
coals as low as Deptford and Greenwich, and some farther down. 

Others delivered great quantities of coals in particular places, where the 
ships could come to the shore, as at Greenwich, Blackwall, and other places, 
in vast heaps, as if to be kept for sale, but were then fetched away, after the 
ships which brought them were gone, so that the seamen had no communica- 
tion with the river-men, nor so much as came near one another. 

Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper getting 
among the colliery, that is to say, among the ships, by which a great many 
seamen died of it; and that which was sdll worse was, that they carried it 
down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and other placea 
on the coast, where, especially at Newcastle and at Sunderland, it carried otf 
a great number of people. 

The making so many fires, as above, did indeed consume an unusual quan<* 
tity of coals; and that upon one or two stops of the ships coming up, whether 
by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies I do not remember, 
but the price of coals was exceeding dear, even as high as £4 a chalder; but it 
soon abated when the ships came in, and as afterwards they had a freer passage, 
the price was very reasonable all the rest of that year. 

The public fires which were made on these occasions, as I have calculated 

it, must necessarily have cost the city about 200 chalders of coals a week, if 
they had continued, which was indeed a very great quantity; but as it was 
thought necessary, nothing was spared. However, as some of the p^sicians 
cried them down, they were not kept alight above four or five days. Tne fires 
were ordered thus:— 

One at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, one at Queenhitbe, and one 
at the Three Cranes; one in Blackfriars, and one at the gate of Bridewell; one 
at the corner of Leadenhall Street and Gracechurch; one at the north and 
one at the south gate of the Royal Exchange; one at Guild Hall, and one at 
Blackwell Hall gate; one at the Lord Mayor’s door in St. Helen’s, one at the 
west entrance into St. Paul’s, and one at the entrance into Bow Church. I do 
not remember whether there was any at the city gates, but one at the Bridge- 
foot there was, just by St. Magnus Church. 

I know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment, and said tiiat 
there died the more people because of those fires; but I am persuaded tho^ 
that say so offer no evidence to prove it, neither can I believe it on any 
account whatever.

It remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in Enifkhd 
during this dreadful time, and particularly as it relates to the manufactures and 
the trade in the city. At the first breaking out of the infection there was, as it 
is easy to suppose, a very great fright among the people, and consequently 
a general stop of trade, except in provisions and necessaries of life; and even 
in those things, as there was a vast number of people fled and a very great 
number alwaysr sick, besides the number which died, so there could not be 
above two-thirds, if above one-half, of the consumption of provisions in the 
city as used to be. . 

It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit, but not of 
hay or grass, by which means bread was cheap, by reason of the plenty of 
com. Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity of grass, but butter and^heese 
were dear, for the same reason, and hay in the market just beyond White- 
chapel Bars was sold at £4 per load. But that affected not the poor. There was 
a most excessive plenty of all sorts of fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, 
cherries, grapes, and they were the cheaper because of the want of people; 
but this made the poor eat them to excess, and this brought them into fluxes, 
griping of the guts, surfeits, and the like, which often precipitated them into 
me plague. 

But to come to matters of trade. First, foreign exportation being stopped or 
at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult, a general stop of all 
those manufactures followed of course which were usually brought for ex- 
portation; and though sometimes merchants abroad were importunate i for 
goods, yet little was sent, the passages being so generally stopped that the 
Ei^lish ships would not be admitted, as is said already, into their port. 

This put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in most parts 
of England, except in some out-ports; and even that was soon stopped, for 
they all had the plague in their turn. But though this was felt all over England, 
yet, what was still worse, all intercourse of trade for home consumption of 
manufactures, especially those which usually circulated through the Londoners’ 
hands, was stopped at once, the trade of the city being stopped. 

All kinds of handicrafts in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics, were, 
as I have said before, out of employ, and this occasioned the putting off and 
dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and workmen of all sorts, 
seeing nothing was done relating to such trades but what might be said to 
be absolutely necessary. 

This caused the multitude of single people in London to be unprovided for, 
as also of families whose living depended upon the labour of the heads of those 
families; I say, this reduced them to extreme misery; arfd I must confess it is 
for the honour of the city of London, and will be for many ages, as long as 
rilis is to be spoken of, that they were able to supply with charitable provision 
the wants of so many thousands of those as afterwards fell sick and were dis- 
txes^d, so that it may be safely averred that nobody perished for want, at 
hsM that the magistrates had any notice given them of. 

irtlis stagnation of our manufacturi^ trade in the country would have put 
tba people there to much greater dif&ulties, but that the master-workmen.

dtid others, to the uttermost of their stocks and strength, kept oo 
^king their goods to keep the poor at work, believing that as soon as the 
sickness should abate they would have a quick demand in proportion to the 
decay of their trade at that time. But as none but those masters that were rich 
could do thus, and that many were poor and not able, the manufacturing trade 
in England suffered greatly, and the poor were pinched all over England by 
the cdamity of the city of London only. 

It is true that the next year made them full amends by another terrible 
calamity upon the city; so that the city by one calamity impoverished and 
weakened the country, and by another calamity, even terrible too of its kind, 
enriched the country and made them again amends; for an infinite quantity 
of household stuff, wearing apparel, and other things, besides whole ware* 
houses filled with merchandise and manufactures, such as come from all parts 
of England, were consumed in the fire of London the next year after this 
terrible visitation. It is incredible what a trade this made all over the whole 
kingdom, to make good the want and to supply that loss; so that, in short, all 
the manufacturing hands in the nation were set on work, and were little 
enough for several years to supply the market and answer the demands. AJl 
foreign markets also were empty of our goods by the stop which had been 
occasioned by the plague,, and before an open trade was allowed again; and 
the prodigious demand at home falling in, joined to make a quick vent for 
all sorts of goods; so thafthere never was known such a trade all over England 
for the time as was in the first seven years after the plague, and after the fire 
of London. 

It remains now that I should say something of the merciful part of this ter- 
rible judgment. The last week in September, the plague being come to its 
crisis, its fury began to assuage. I remember my friend Dr. Heath, coming 
to see me the week before, told me he was sure that the violence of it would 
assuage in a few days; but when I saw the weekly bill of that week, which 
was the highest of the whole year, being 8297 of all diseases, I upbraided him 
with it, and asked him what he had made his judgment from. His answer, 
however, was not so much to seek as I thought it would have been. “Look 
you,” says he, “by the number which are at this time sick and infected, there 
should have been twenty thousand dead the last week' instead of eight thou- 
sand, if the inveterate mortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago; 
for then it ordinarily killed in two or three days, now not under eight or ten; 
and then not above one in five recovered, whereas I have observed that now 
not above two in five miscarry. And, observe it from me, the next bill will 
decrease, and you will see many more people recover than used to do; for 
though a vast multitude are now everywhere infected, and as many every day 
fall sick, yet there will not so many die as there did, for the maligmty of 
the distemper is abated;” adding that he began now to hope, nay, more than 
hope, that the infection had passed its crisis and was going off; and accordiMly 
so it was, for the next week being, as I said, the last in September, the Dill 
decreased almost two thousand. 

It is true the plague was still at a frightful height, and the next bill was no 



m WORKS OP t>Amt tmot 

Im tihan ^6o, and the nm to diat^ 5720; but still my friend^s obsenradon wa$ 
fust, and it did appear the peof>le ^d recover faster and more in number than 
they used to do; and indeed, if it had not been so, what had been the condition 
of the city of London? For, according to my friend, there were not fewer 
than ($0,000 people at that time infected,* whereof, as above, 20,477 and 
near 40,000 recovered; whereas, had it been as it was before, 50,000 of that 
numb^ would^very probably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more would 
have sickened; for, in a word, the whole mass of people began to sicken, and 
it looked as if none would escape. 

But this remark of my friend’s appeared more evident in a few weeks more, 
for the decrease went on, and another week in October it decreased [1843, so 
that the number dead of the plague was but 2665; and the next week it de- 
creased 1413 more, and yet it was seen plainly that there was abundance of 
people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and abundance fill sick 
every day, but (as above) the malignity of the disease abated. \ 

Such is the precipitant disposition of our people (whether it is so or not all 
over the world, that’s none of my particular business to inquire), but I saw 
it apparently here, that as upon the first fright of the infection, they shunned 
one another, and fled from one another’s houses and from the city with an 
unaccountable and, as I thought, unnecessary fright, so now, upon this notion 
^reading, viz., that the distemper was not so catching as formerly, and that 
if it was catched it was not so mortal, and seeing abundance of people who 
really fell sick recover again daily, they took to such a precipitant coiprage, 
and grew so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, that they 
made no more of the pkgue than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed so much. 
They not only went boldly into company with those who had tumours and 
carbuncles upon them that were running, and consequently contagious, but ate 
and drank with them, nay, into their houses to visit them, and even, as I was 
told, into their very chambers where they lay sick, 

Tliis I could not see rational. My friend Dr, Heath allowed, and it was 
plaiii to experience, that the distemper was as catching as ever, and as many 
fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of those that fell sick did not die; 
but I think that while many did die, and that at best the distemper itself was 
very terrible, the sores and swellings very tormenting, and the danger of 
deatfi not left out of the circumstance of sickness, though not so frequent as 
before; all those things, together with the exceeding tediousness of the cure, 
the loathsomeness of the disease, and many other articles, were enough to 
deter any man living from a dangerous mixture with the sick people, and 
make them as anxious almost to avoid the infection a& before. 

Nw, there was another thing which made the mere catching of the distem- 
per firightful, and that was the terrible burning of the caustics which the 
anrgeons laid on the swellings to bring them to break and to run, without 
, jwhich the danger of death was very great, even to the last. Also, the insuffer- 
^ i^le torment of the swellings, which, though it m%ht not make people raving 
and distracted, as they were before, and as I have given several instances of 
already* yet<. 5 ftcy put the patient to inexpressible torment; and those that fell

into ii; dsowh they escape with life, yet they made bitter conrqdiittts irf 
those that had told them there was xio danger, and sadly repented ^eir xwAur 
ness and folly in venturing to run into the reach of it 
Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end here, for a great many daat 
thus cast off their cautions suffered' more deeply stUl, and though many es^ 
caped, yet many died; and at least it had this public mischief attending it, that 
it made the decrease of burials slower than it would otherwise, have been. For 
as this notion ran like lightning through the city, and people’s heads were pos^ 
sessed with it, even as soon as the first great decrease in the bills appeared, we 
found that the two next bills did not decrease in proportion; the reason I take 
to be the people’s running so rashly into danger, giving up all their former 
cautions and care, and all the shyness which they used to practise, depending 
that the sickness would not reach them, or that if it did, they should not die* 
The physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with all thdr 
might, and gave out printed directions, spreading them all over the city and 
suburbs, advising the people to continue reserved, and to use still the utmost 
caution in their ordinary conduct, notwithstanding the decrease of the dis- 
temper, terrifying them with the danger of bringing a relapse upon the whole 
city, and telling them how such a relapse might be more fatal and dangerous 
than the whole visitation that had been already; with many arguments and 
reasons to explain and prove that part to them, and which are too long to 
repeat here. 

But it was all to no purpose; the audacious creatures were so possessed with 
the first joy and so surprised with the satisfaction of seeing a vast decrease 
in the weekly bills, that they were impenetrable by any new terrors, and 
would not be persuaded but that the bitterness of death was past, and it was to 
no more purpose to talk to them than to an east wind, but they opened shops,, 
went about streets, did business, and conversed with anybody mat came in 
their way to converse with, whether with business or without, neither inquire 
ing of their health or so much as being apprehensive of any danger from thenit 
though they knew them not to be sound. 

This imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many their lives who had with 
great care and caution shut themselves up and kept retired, as it were, from 
all mankind, and had by that means, under God’s providence, been preserved 
through all the heat of that infection. 

Thw rash and foolish conduct, I say, of* the people went so far that the 
ministers took notice to them of it at la^ and laid before them both the f olfy 
and danger of it; and this checked it a little, so that they grew more cautioua. 
But it had another effect, which they could not check; for as the first rumoue 
had spread not over the city only, but into the country, it had the like effect, 
and me people were so tired with being so long from London, and so eager 
to come back, that they flocked to town without fear or forecast, and b^aii 
to show themselves in the streets, as if all the danger was over. It was inde^ 
surprising to see it, for though there died still from looo to i8oo a wedk, yet 
the peo^e flocked to town as if all had been well. 

Tne consequence of this was, that the bills increased again 400 the very fint

imik in November; and if I might believe the physicians, there was above 
jboo fell sick that week, most of them newcomers, too. 

One John Cock, a barber in St. MartinVle-Grand, was an eminent example 
of this; I mean of the hasty return of the people when the plague was abated. 
This John Cock had left the town with his whole family, and locked up his 
house, and was gone in the country, as many others did; and finding the plague 
$o decreased in November that there died but 905 per week of all diseases, 
he ventured home again. He had in his family ten persons; that is to say, him- 
self and wife, five children, two apprentices, and a maid-servant. He had not 
been returned to his house above a week, and began to open his shop and carry 
on his trade, but the distemper broke out in his family, and within about five 
days they all died, except one; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his five chil- 
dren, and his two apprentices; and only the maid remained alive. 1 

But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason to rapect; 
for the malignity, as I have said, of the distemper was spent, the contagion 
was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on apace, and the air was 
clear and cold, with some sharp frosts; and this increasing still, most of those 
that had fallen sick recovered, and the health of the city began to return. There 
were indeed some returns of the distemper even in the month of December, 
and the bills increased near a hundred; but it went off again, and so in a short 
while things began to return to their own channel. And wonderful it was to 
see how populous the city was again all on a sudden, so that a stranger could 
not miss the numbers that were lost. Neither was there any miss of the inhabi- 
tants as to their dwellings, few or no empty houses were to be seen, or if there 
were some, there was no want of tenants for them. 

I wish I could say that as the city had a new face, so the manners of the 
p^ple had a new appearance. I doubt not but there were many that retained 
a sincere sense of their deliverance, and that were heartily thankful to that 
Sovereign Hand that had protected them in so dangerous a time; it would be 
very uncharitable to judge otherwise in a city so populous, and where the people 
were so devout as they were here in the time of the visitation itself; but except 
what of this was to be found in particular families and faces, it must be ac- 
knowledged that the general practice of the people was just as it was before, 
and very little difference was to be seen. 

Some, indeed, said things were worse; that the morals of the people declined 
from this very time; that the people, hardened by the danger they had been in, 
like seamen after a storm is over, were more wicked and more stupid, more 
bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities than they were before; but 
I will not carry it so far neither. It would take up a history of no small length 
to give a particular of all the gradations by which the course of things in mis 
city came to be restored again, and to run in their own channel as they did 
before. 

V Some parts of England were now infected as violently as London had been; 

cities of Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln, Colchester, and other places 
Were now visited; and the magistrates of London began to set rules for our 
^ conduct as to corresponding with those cities. It is true we could not pretend to

forbid their people coming to London, because it was impossible to know them 
asunder, so, after manv consultations, the Lord Mayor and 0)urt of Aldo^ 
men were obliged to drop it. All they could do was to warn and caution the 
people not to entertain in their houses or converse with any people who they 
knew came from such infected places. 

But they might as well have talked to the air, for the people of London 
thought themselves so plague«free now that they were past all admonittons; 
they seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored, and Aat the air was 
like a man that had had the small-pox, not capable of being infected again. 
This revived that notion that the infection was all in the air, that there was 
no such thing as contagion from the sick people to the sound; and so strongly 
did this whimsy prevail among people that they ran all together promiscu- 
ously, sick and well. Not the Mahometans, who, prepossessed with the princi- 
ple of predestination, value nothing of contagion, let it be in what it will, could 
be more obstinate than the people of London; they that were perfectly sound, 
and came out of the wholesome air, as we call it, into the city, made nothiM 
of going into the same houses and chambers, nay, even into the same beds, with 
th^e that had the distemper upon them, and were not recovered. 

Some, indeed, paid for their audacious boldness with the price of their lives; 
an infinite number fell sick, and the physicians had more work than ever, only 
with this difference, that more of their patients recovered; that is to say, they 
generally recovered, but certainly there were more people infected and fell sick 
nov^, when there did not die above a thousand or twelve hundred in a week, 
than there was when there died five or six thousand a week, so entirely negli- 
gent were the people at that time in the great and dangerous case of he^th 
and infection, and so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of those 

who cautioned them for their good. , 

The people being thus returned, as it were, m general, it was very strange 
to find, that in their inquiring after their friends, some whole families were so 
entirely swept away that there was no remembrance of them l®f 
anybody to be found to possess or show any title to that little they had left; 
for in such cases what was to be found was generally embezzled and purlomeo.

fcms W a great while. As for the Dutdi, the misiinderstaiidsdgs between our 
court and them had brok^ out mto a war the year before, so that our trade 
that w^ was wholly interrupted; but Spain and Portugal, Itdy and Barbary, 
as ^0 Hamburg and all the ports in the Baltic, these were all shy of us a great 
while, and would not restore trade with u« for many months. 

The distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as I have observed, many if 
not all the out-parishes were obliged to make new burying-grounds, besides 
that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields, some of which were continued, and 
remain in use to this day. But others were left off, and which, I confess, I men- 
tion with some reflection, being converted into other uses or built upoi after- 
wards, the dead bodies were disturbed, abused, dug up again, some even before 
the Besh of them was perished from the bones, and removed like dung ir rub- 
bish to other places. Some of those which came within the reach of my observa- 
tion are as follows: 

I. A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill, being \some 
of the remains of the old lines or fortifications of the city, where abundance 
were buried promiscuously from the parishes of Aldersgate, Clerkenwell, and 
even out of the city. This ground, as I take it, was since made a physic garden, 
and after that has been built upon. 

a. A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then called, at the 
end of Holloway Lane, m Shoreditch parish. It has been since made a yard for 
keeping hogs, and for other ordinary uses, but is quite out of use as a burying- 
ground. 

3. The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was th6n a 
green field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate parish, though many 
of the cart$ out of the city brought their dead thither also, particularly out 
of the parish of St. Allhallows on the Wall. This place 1 cannot mention with- 
out much regret. It was, as I remember, about two or three years after the 
plague was ceased that Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of the ground. 
It was reported, how true I know not, that it fell to the king for want of 
heirs, all those who had any right to it being carried off by the pestilence, and 
that Sir Robert Qayton obtained a grant of it from King Charles II. But how- 
ever he came by it, certain it is the ground was let out to build on, or built 
t^n, by his order. The first house built upon it was a large fair house, still 
standing, which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley, which, though 
jodled an alley, is as wide as a street. The houses in the same row with that 
house northward are built on the very same ground where the poor people 
were buried, and the bodies, on opening the ground for the foundations, were 
dug up, some of them remaining so plain to be seen thgt the women’s skulls 
were distinguished by their long hair, and of others the fiesh was not quite 
perished; so that the people began to exclaim loudly against it, and some sug- 
gested that it might endanger a return of the contagion; after which the bones 
and bpdies, as fast as they came at them, were carried to another part of the 
same jprouKid and thrown all together into a deep pit, dug on purpose, which 
now to be known in that it is not built on, but is a passage to another house 
at the upper end of Rose Alley, just against the door ot a meeting-house, whidh

has been bnilt rfiere many years since; and Ae ground is palisadoed * ftiM 
the rest of the passage, in a litde square; there lie^thc bones and retnains of 
near two thousand bodies, carried by the dead-carts to their grave in that one 
year. 

4. Besides this, there was a piece 6f ground in Mooriields, by the goir^ into 

the street which is now called Old Bethlem, which was enlarged much, mough 
not wholly taken in on the same occasion. , 

B.— *The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground, being at 
his own desire, his sister havmg been buried there a few years before.] 

5. Stepney parish, extending itself from the east part of London to the north, 
even to the very edge of Shoreditch Churchyard, had a piece of ground taken 
in to bury their dead close to the said churchyard, and which for that very 
reason was left open, and is since, I suppose, taken into the same churchyara 
And they had also two other burying-piaces in Spitalfields, one where since a 
ch^el or tabernacle has been built for ease to this great parish, and anp^er 
in Fetticoat Lane. 

There were no less than five other grounds made use of for the parish of 
Stepney at that time, one where now stands the parish church of St. Paul, 
Shadwell, and the other where now stands the parish church of St. John’s at 
Wapping, both which had not the names of parishes at that time, but were 
belonging to Stepney parish. 

I could name many more, but these coming within my particular knowledge, 
the circumstance, I thought, made it of use to record them. From the whole, 
it may be observed that they were obliged in this time of distress to take iu 
new burying-grounds in most of the out-parishes for laying the prodigious 
numbers of people which died in so short a space of time, but why care was 
not taken to keep those places separate from ordinary uses, that so the bodies 
might rest undisturbed, that I cannot answer for, and must confess I think it 
was wrong. Who were to blame I know not. 

I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a buryidg»- 
ground set apart to their use, and which they still make use of; and they had 
also a particular dead-cart to fetch their dead from their houses; and the 
famous Solomon Eagle, who, as I mentioned before, had predicted the plague 
as a judgment, and ran naked through the streets, telling the people that it was 
come upon them to punish them for their sins, had his own wife died the vciy 
next day of the plague, and was carried, one of the first in the Quakers’ deao* 
cart, to their new burying-ground. 

I might have thronged this account with many more remarkable things 
which occurred in the time of the infection, and particularly what passed be* 
tween the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was then at Oxford, and wiw 
directions were from time to time received from the Government for theit 
conduct on this critical occasion. But really the Court concerned thcmsdves 
so little, and that little they did was of so small import, that I do not see k 
of much moment to mention any part of it here, except that of appoihtiilg 
a monthly fast in the city and the sending the royal charity to the relief of the 
poor, both which I have mentioned before. 



SW WORKS OP DANIEL DEFOE 

was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their patients 
during the sickness, and now they came to town again nobody cared to employ 
them. They were called deserters, and frequently bills were set up upon their 
doors and written, ^Here is a doctor to be let,” so that several of those physi- 
cians were fain for a while to sit still and *look about them, or at least remove 
their dwellings, and set up in new places and among new acquaintance. The 
like was the case with the clergy, whom the people were indeed very abusive 
to, writing verses and scandalous reflections upon them, setting upon the 
church-door, “Here is a pulpit to be let,” or sometimes, “to be sold,” which 
was worse. j 

It was not the least of our misfortunes, that with our infection, when it 
ceased, there did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander ind re- 
proach, which was really the great troubler of the nation’s peace before. Ut was 
said to be the remains of the old animosities, which had so lately involved us 
all in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of Indemnity had laid asle^ the 
quarrel itself, so the Government had recommended family and personal peace 
upon all occasions to the whole nation. 

But it could not be obtained, and particularly after the ceasing of the plague 
in London, when any one that had seen the condition which the people had 
been in, and how they caressed one another at that time, promised to have 
more charity for the future, and to raise no more reproaches; I say, any one 
that had seen them then would have thought they would have come together 
with another spirit at last. But, I say, it could not be obtained. The quaprrel 
remained; the Church and the Presb)^erians were incompatible. As soon as the 
plague was removed, the Dissenting ousted ministers who had supplied the 
pulpits which were deserted by the incumbents retired; they could expect no 
other but that they should immediately fall upon them and harass them with 
their penal laws, accept their preaching while they were sick, and persecute 
them as soon as they were recovered again; this even we that were of the 
Church thought was very hard, and could by no means approve of it. 

But it was the Government, and we could say nothing to hinder it; we could 
only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer for it. 

On the other hand, the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of the Church 
with going away and deserting their charge, abandoning the people in their 
danger, and when they had most need of comfort, and the like, this we could 
by no means approve, for all men have not the same faith and the same cour- 
age, and the Scripture commands us to judge the most favourably and accord- 
ing to charity. 

A plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with terrors that every man 
is not suflSciently fortified to resist or prepared to stand the shock against. It 
is very certain that a great many of the clergy who were in circumstances to 
do it withdrew and fled for the safety of their lives; but ’tis true also that a 
great many of them stayed, and many of them fell in the calamity and in the 
discharge of their duty. 

it is true some of the Dissenting tomed-out ministers stayed, and their 
courage to be commended and highly valued, but these were not abundance;

it cannot be said that they all stayed, and diat none retired into the country, 
any more than it can be said of the Church clergy that they all went away* 
Neither did all those that went away go without substituting curates and 
others in their places, to do the offices needful and to visit the sick, as far 
as it was practicable; so that, upon the whole, an allowance of charity 
might have been made on both sides, and we should have considered that 
such a time as this of 1665 is not to be paralleled in history, and that it is 
not the stoutest courage that will always support men in such cases. I had not 
said this, but had rather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of 
those of both sides, who did hazard themselves for the service of the poor 
people in their distress, without remembering that any failed in their duty on 
either side. But the want of temper among us has made the contrary to this 
necessary, some that stayed not only boasting too much of themselves, but 
reviling those that fled, branding them with cowardice, deserting their flocte, 
and acting the part of the hireling, and the like. I recommend it to the ch^ty 
of all good people to look back and reflect duly upon the terrors of the time, 
and whoever does so will see that it is not an ordinary strength that could 
support it. It was not like appearing in the head of an army or charging a body 
of horse in the field, but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse; to ^y 
was indeed to die, and it could be esteemed nothing less, especially as things 
appeared at the latter end of August and the beginning of September, and as 
there was reason to expect them at that time; for no man expected, and I dai^ 
say believed, that the distemper would take so sudden a turn as it did, and fall 
immediately 2000 in a week, when there was such a prodigious number of 
people sick at that time as it was known there was, and then it was that many 
shifted away that had stayed most of the time before. 

Besides, if God gave strength to some more than to others, was it to boast 
of their ability to abide the stroke, and upbraid those that had not the same 
gift and support, or ought not they rather to have been humble and thankful 
tf ffiey were rendered more useful than their brethren? 

I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men, as well clergy 
as physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, magistrates, and officers of eveiy ^d, 
as also all useful people who ventured their lives in discharge of their duty, 
as most certainly all such as stayed did to the last degree, and several of all 
these kinds did not only venture but lose their lives on that sad occasion. 

I was once making a list of all such, I mean of all thofee professions and em- 
ployments who thus died, as I caU it, in the way of their duty; but it was 
impossible for a private man to come at a certainty in the particulars. I only 
remember that there died sixteen clergymen, two aldermen, five physiaans, 
thirteen surgeons, within the city and Uberties before the beginning of Septem- 
ber. But this being, as I said before, the great crisis and extremity of the ^ec- 
tion, it can be no complete list. As to inferior people, I think there died 
and-forty constables and head-boroughs in the two parches of Stepney and 
Whitechapel; but I could not carry my list on, for when the violent rage of the 
distemper in September came upon us, it drove us out of all measures. Mw 
did then no more die by tale and by number. They might put out a weeMy

biU^ ai^ call ^em aevexi or eight thousand, or what they pleased; 'ti$ certain 
dbey died hy heaps, and were Duried by heaps, that is to say, without accountt 
if I might believe some people, who were more abroad and more conversant 
those things than I— though I was public enough for one that had no more 
business to do than I had,— I say, if 1 may believe them, there was not many 
less buried those first three weeks in September than ao,ooo per week. How- 
ever the others *.aver the truth of it, yet I rather choose to keep to the public 
account; seven and eight thousand per week is enough to make good aU that 
I have said of the terror of those times, and it is much to the satisfaction of ,me 
that write, as well as those that read, to be able to say that everything isj set 
down with moderation, and rather within compass than beyond it. I 

Upon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when we were recovered, our 
conduct had been more distinguished for charity and kindness in remembraiKe 
of the past calamity, and not so much a valuing ourselves upon our boldn^ 
in staying, as if all men were cowards that fiy from the hand of God, or dm 
diose who stay do not sometimes owe their courage to their ignorance and 
demising the hand of their Maker, which is a criminal kind of desperation, and 
not a true courage. 

X cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers, such as constables, 
head-boroughs, Lord Mayor’s and sheriffs’-men, as also parish-oflicers, whose 
business it was to take charge of the poor, did their duties in general with as 
much courage as any, and perhaps witn more, because their work was attended 
ivith more hazards, and lay more among the poor, who were more subject to bd 
infected, and in the most pitiful plight when they were taken with the infec- 
tion. But then it must be added to that a great number of them died; indeed 
it was scarce possible it should be otherwise. 

I have not said one word here about the physic or preparations that we 
ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion— I mean we that went fre- 
quently abroad up and down street, as I did; much of this was talked of in the 
books and bills of our quack doctors, of whom I have said enough already. 
It may, however, be added, that the College of Physicians were daily publish- 
ing several preparations, which they had considered of in the process of their 
practice, and which being to be had in print, 1 avoid repeating them for that 
reason. 

One thing I could not help observing, what befell one of the quacks, who 
published that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague, which 
whoever kept about them should never be infected or liable to infection. This 
man, who, we may reasonably suppose, did not go abroad without some of this 
e^rcdlent preservative in his pocket, yet was taken by tHe distemper, and 
parried off in two or three days. 

I am not of the number of the physic-haters or physic-despisers; on the con- 
trary, I have often mentioned the regard I had to the dictates of my particular 
friend Dr. Heath; but yet I must acimowledge I made use of little or nothif)g,r 
egmptf as I have observed, to keep a preparation of strong scent to have re^y, 
in case I met with anythu^ of offensive smells, or went too near any burying- 
place or dead body. 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR m 

Netdier did I do, what I know aome did, keep the spirits always high and 
hot: with cordials and wme, and such things, and which, as I observed, one 
learned physician used himself so much to as that he could not leave them 
off when the infection was quite gone, and so became a sot for all his life after* 
I remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a certain set 
of drugs and preparations which were all certainly good and useful in the case 
of an infection, out of which, or with which, physicians might make an infinite 
variety of medicines, as the ringers of bells make seveiS* hundred different 
rounds of music by the changing and order of sound but in six bells, and that 
all these preparations shall be really very good: “Therefore,” said he, “I do not 
wonder that so vast a throng of medicines is offered in the present calamity, 
and almost every physician prescribes or prepares a different thing, as his 
judgment or experience guides him; but,” says my friend, “let all the prescrip* 
tions of all the physicians in London be examined, and it will be found that 
they are all compounded of the same things, with such variations only as the 
particular fancy of the doctor leads him to; so that,” says he, “every man, judg^ 
mg a little of his own constitution and manner of his hving, and circumstances 
of his being infected, may direct his own medicines out of the ordinary drugs 
and preparations* Only that,” says he, “some recommend one thing as most 
sovereign, and some another. Some,” says he, “think that pill. which is 
called Itself the antipestilential pill, is the best pr^aration that can be made; 
others think that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself to resist the contagion; atid 
I,” says he, “think as both these think, viz.,.that the last is good to take before* 
hand to prevent it, and the last, if touched, to expel it.” According to this opin^ 
ion, I several times took Venice treacle, and a sound sweat upon it, and thought 
myself as well fortified against the infection as any one could be fortified by 
the power of physic. 

As for quackery and mountebanks, of which the town was so full, I listened 
to none of them, and have observed often since, with some wonder, that for 
two years after the plague I scarcely saw or heard of one of them about town* 
Some fancied they were all swept away in the infection to a man, and were 
for calling it a particular mark of God’s vengeance upon them for leading the 
poor people into the pit of destruction, merely for the lucre of a litdc money 
they got by them; but I cannot go that length neither. That abundance of them 
died is certain; many of them came within the reach of my own knowle<tee; 
but that all of them were swept off I much question. I believe rather they SbA 
into the country, and tried their practices upon the people there, who were iu 
apprehension of the infection before it came among mem. ^ 

This, however, is certain, not a man of them appeared for a great while in 
or about London. There were, indeed, several doctors who published WSm 
recommending their several physical preparations for cleanring the body« ^ 
they call it, after the plague, and needful, as they said, for such people to uke 
who had been visited and had been cured; whereas, I must own, I believe thar 
was die opinion of the most eminent physicians at that time that the plagts^ 
was itself a sufficient purge, and that those who escaped the infection needied 
physic to cleanse their bodies of any other things, the running sores, ifee

txxtnowtSy &c., which were broke and kept open by the directions of the phy^^ 
dans, having sufficiently deansed them; and that all other distempers, ant 
causes of distempers, were effectually carried off that way; and as tne physi- 
cians gave this as their opinions wherever they came, the quacks got litde 
business. 

There were, indeed, several little hurries which happened after the decrease 
of the plague, and which, whether they were contrived to fright and disorder 
the people, as some imagined, I cannot say, but sometimes we were told the 
plague would return by such a time; and the famous Solomon Eagle, th^ naked 
Quaker I have mentioned, prophesied evil tidings every day; and several others 
telling us that London had not been sufficiently scourged, and that soj^ and 
severer strokes were yet behind. Had they stopped there, or had they descended 
to particulars, and told us that the city should the next year be destro;^d by 
fire, then, indeed, when we had seen it come to pass, we should not have been 
to blame to have paid more than a common respect to their prophetic spirits; 
at least we should have wondered at them, and have been more serious in our 
inquiries after the meaning of it, and whence they had the foreknowledge. 
But as they generally told us of a relapse into the plague, we have had no con- 
cern since tfet about them; yet by those frequent clamours, we were all kept 
with some kind of apprehensions constantly upon us; and if any died suddenly, 
or if the spotted fevers at any time increased, we were presently alarmed; 
much more if the number of the plague increased, for to the end of the year 
there were always between 200 and 300 of the plague. On any of these occa- 
sions, I say, we were alarmed anew. 

Those who remember the city of London before the fire must remember 
that there was then no such place as that we now call Newgate Market, but 
that in the middle of the street which is now called Blowbladder Street, and 
which had its name from the butchers, who used to kill and dress their sheep 
there (and who, it seems, had a custom to blow up their meat with pipes to 
make it look thicker and fatter than it was, and were punished there for it by 
the Lord Mayor); I say, from the end of the street towards Newgate there 
stood two long rows of shambles for the selling meat. 

It was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead, as they were 
buying meat, gave rise to a rumour that the meat was all infected, which, 
iJiough it might affright the people, and spoiled the market for two or three 
days, yet it appeared plainly «terwards that there was nothing of truth in the 
suggestion. But nobody can account for the possession of fear when it takes 
hold of the mind. 

However, it pleased God, by the continuing of the winter weather, so to 
restore the health of the city that by February following we reckoned the 
distemper quite ceased, and then we were not so easily frighted again. 

There was still a question among the learned, and at first perplexed the 
people a litde, and that was in what manner to purge the house and goods 
where the plague had been, and how to render them habitable again, which had 
been left empty during the time of the plague. Abundance of perfumes and 
preporadons were prescribed by physicians, some of one kind and some of

Mother, in which the {>eopIe who listened to them put themselves to a gteat« 

^ jpnd indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary expense; and the poorer people, 
who only set open their windows night and day, burned brimstone, pitch, and 
gunpowder, and such things in their rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the 
eager people, who, as I said above,* came home in haste and at all hazards, 
found little or no inconvenience in their houses, nor in the goods, and did little 
or nothing to them. 

However, in general, prudent, cautious people did enter into* some measures 
for airing and sweetening their houses, and burned perfumes, incense, benjamin, 
rosin, and sulphur, in their rooms close shut up, and then let the air carry it 
aU out with a blast of gunpowder; others caused large fires to be made all day 
and all night for severS days and nights; by the same token that two or three 
were pleased to set their houses on nre, and so effectually sweetened them by 
burning them down to the ground; as particularly one at Ratcliff, one in Hol- 
born, and one at Westminster; besides two or three that were set on fire, but 
the fire was happily got out again before it went far enough to burn down the 
houses; and one citizen’s servant, I think it was in Thames Street, carried so 
much gunpowder into his master’s house, for clearing it of the infection, and 
managed it so foolishly, that he blew up part of the roof of the house. But 
the time was not fully come that the city was to be purged by fire, nor was it 
far off; for within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes; when, as some 
of our quacking philosophers pretend, the seeds of the plague were entirely 
destroyed, and not before; a notion too ridiculous to speak of here, since, had 
the seeds of the plague remained in the houses, not to be destroyed but by fire, 
how has it been that they have not since broken out, seeing all those buildings 
in the suburbs and liberties, all in the great parishes of Stepney, Whitechapel, 
Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Cripplegate, and St. Giles, where the fire 
never came, and where the plague raged with the greatest violence, remain still 
in the same condition they were in before? 

But to leave these things just as I found them, it was certain that those 

a le who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health, did take par- 
IT directions for what they called seasoning of their houses, and abundance 
of costly things were consumed on that account, which I cannot but say not 
only seasoned those houses, as they desired, but filled the air with very grateful 
and wholesome smells, which others had the share of the benefit of as well as 
those who were at the expenses of them. 

I And yet after all, though the poor came to town very precipitandy, as I 
have said, yet I must say the rich made no such haste. The men of business, 

' indeed, came up, but many of them did not bring their families to tovm till 
the spring came on, and that they saw reason to depend upon it that the 
plague would not return. 

The Court, indeed, came up soon after Christmas, but the nobility 
gentry, except such as depended upon and had employment under the adminis* 
tration, did not come so soon. 

I should have taken notice here, that notwithstanding the violence the 
plague in London and in other places, yet it was very observable that it was

liever on board the fleet, and yet for some time tlhere was a strange press la the 
river, and even in the streets, for seamen to man the fleet. But it was in the 
banning of the year, when the plague was scarce begun, and not at all come 
down to that part of the city where they usually press for seamen; and thot^h 
a war with the Dutch was not at all grateful to the people at that time, and 
the seamen went with a kind of reluctancy into the service, and many com- 
plained of being dragged into it by force, yet it proved in the event a happy 
violence to several of them, who had probably perished in the general calamity, 
and who, after the summer service was over, though they had cause to lament 
die desolation of their families, who— when they came back, were many of 
them in their graves— yet they had room to be thankful that they were carried 
out of the reach of it, though so much against their wills. We indeed 
hot war with the Dutch that year, and one very great engagement at sel m 
which the Dutch were worsted, but we lost a great many men and some s 
But, as I observed, the plague was not in the fleet, and when they came to uay 
up the ships in the river tne violent part of it began to abate. \ 

I would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy year with 
some particular examples historically; I mean of the thankfulness to God, our 
preserver, for our being delivered from this dreadful calamity. Certainly the 
circumstance of the deliverance, as well as the terrible enemy we were deliv- 
ered from, called upon the whole nation for it. The circumstances of the de- 
liverance were indeed very remarkable, as I have in part mentioned already, 
and particularly the dreadful condition which we were all in, when we were, 
to the surprise of the whole town, made joyful with the hope of a stop of the 
infection. ^ 

Nothing but the immediate finger of God, nothing but omnipotent power, 
could have done it. The contagion despised all medieme; death raged in every 
comer; and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have 
cleared the town of all, and everything that had a soul. Men everywhere began 
to despair; every heart failed them for fear; people were made desperate 
throtigh the anguish of their souls, and the terrors of death sat in the very 
fai!:es and countenances of the people. 

In diat very moment, when we might very well say, *‘Vain was the help of 
man,* —I say, in that very moment it pleased God, with a most agreeable sur- 
prise, to cause the fury of it to abate, even of itself; and the malignity declin- 
ing, as I have said, though infinite numbers were sick, yet fewer died, and the 
very first week’s bill decreased 1843; a vast number indeed! 

It Is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very countenances 
of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly bill came out. It might 
have been perceived in their countenances that a secret surprise and sn^e of 
joy sat on everybody’s face. They shook one another b^ the hands in the 
streets, who would hardly go on the same side of the way with one smother 
before. \^ere the streets were not too broad, they would open their windows 
and odl from one house to another, and ask how they did, and if they had 
beard the good news that the plague was abated. Some would return, 
they said good news, and ask, ‘*What good news?” and when they answered 



A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE IfEAR SiF 

the plague abated and the bills decreased almost 2000, they wotfld cry 
out, ‘^God be praised,’’ and would weep aloud for joy, telling them they had 
heard nothing of it; and such was the joy of the people that it was, as it were, 
life to them from the grave. I could almost set down as many extravagant 
things done in the excess of their jefy as of their grief; but that would be to 
lessen the value of it. 

I must confess myself to have been very much dejected \ust before t h*s 
happened; for the prodigious number that were taken sick the week or two 
before, besides those that died, was such, and the lamentations were so great 
everywhere, that a man must have seemed to have acted even against !us 
reason if he had so much as expected to escape; and as there was hardly a house 
but mine in all my neighbourhood but what was infected, so had it gone on it 
would not have been long that there would have been any more neighbours 
to be infected. Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc the last three 
weeks had made, for if I might believe the person whose calculations I always 
found very well grounded, there were not less than 30,000 people dead and 
near 100,000 fallen sick in the three weeks I speak of; for the number that 
sickened was surprising, indeed it was astonishing, and those whose courage 
upheld them all the time before, sank under it now. 

In the middle of their distress, when the condition of the city of London 
was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God, as it were, by His immediate 
hand to disarm this enemy; the poison was taken out of the sting. It was 
wonderful; even the physicians themselves were surprised at it. Wherever they 
visited they found their patients better; either they had sweated kindly, or thi 
tumours were broke, or the carbuncles went down, and the inflammations 
round them changed colour, or the fever was gone, or the violent headache 
was assuaged, or some good symptom was in the case; so that in a few days 
everybody was recovering, whole families that were infected and down, tliat 
had ministers praying with them, and cimected death every hour, were revived 
and healed, and none died at all out of them. 

Nor was this by any new medicine found out, or new method of cure dis^ 
covered, or by any experience in the operation which the physicians or sur- 
geons attained to; but it was evidently from the secret invisible hand of Him 
that had at first sent this disease as a judgment upon us; and let the atheistic 
part of mankind call my saying what they please, it is no enthusiasm; it ym 
acknowledged at that time by all mankind. The disease was enervated and its 
malignity spent; and let it proceed from whencesoever it will, let the philoso^ 
phers search for reasons in nature to account for it by, and labour as much as 
they will to lessen the debt they owe to their Maker, those physicians who 
had the least share of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge that it was 
idl supernatural, that it was extraordinary, and uiat no account could be pyen 

of it. , r , 

If I should say that this is a visible summons to us all to thankfulness, espe- 
cially we that were under the terror of its increase, perhaps it may be thou^t 
by some, after the sense of the thing was over, an omcious canting of religions 
things, preaching a sermon instead of writing a history, making myself t

my observations of thi^; and this restrains me ver^ 
mtiieti from going on here, as I might otherwise do. But if ten lepers wer^ 
betted^ and but one returned to give thanks, 1 desire to be as that one, and to b 
ihapkM for myself. 

<Nbr wili t deny but there were abundsCnce of people who, to all appearance 
vreee "very thankful at that time; for their mouths were stopped, even th 
moitths of tho^e whose hearts were not extraordinary long affected with it. Bu 
die impression was so strong^at that time that it could not be resisted, no, no 
by d>e worst of the people. 

It was a common thing to meet people in the street that were strangers, ar 
that we knew nothing at ail of, expressing their surprise. Going one da 
through Aldgate, and a pretty many people being passing and repassing, thci 
comes a man out of the end of the Minories, and looking a little up th^stre< 
and down, he throws his hands abroad, “Lord, what an alteration is here! Wh) 
last week I came along here, and hardly anybody was to be seen.” Anpthe 
man, I heard him, adds to his words, “ ’Tis all wonderful; ’ds all a dream.’ 
“Blessed be God,” says a third man, “and let us give thanks to Him, foi^ ’tl* 
all His own doing, human help and human skill was at an end.” These wen 
9 II strangers to one another. But such salutations as these were frequent in tht 
street every day; and in spite of a loose behaviour, the very common peopl 
went along the streets giving God thanks for their deliverance. 

It was now, as I said before, the people had cast off all apprehensions,fcani 
that too fast; indeed we were no more afraid now to pass by a man with 
white cap upon his head, or with a cloth wrapt round his neck, or with hi 
leg limping, occasioned by the sores in his groin, all which were frightful tt 
the last degree but the week before. But now the street was full of them, anc 
these poor recovering creatures, give them their due, appeared very sensible 
of their unexpected deliverance; and I should wrong them very much if 1 
should not acknowledge that I believe many of them were really thankful 
But I must own, that for the generality of the people, it might too justly be 
said of them as was said of the children of Israel, after their being delivered 
from the host of Pharaoh, when they passed the Red Sea, and looked back, and 
saw the Egyptians overwhelmed in the water, viz., that they sang His praise, 
but they soon forgot His works. 

1 can go no farther here. I should be counted censurious, and perhaps unjust, 
if I should enter into the unpleasing work of reflecting, whatever cause there 
was for it, upon the unthankfulness and return of all manner of wickedness 
among us, which I was so much an eye-witness of myself. I shall conclude the 
account of this calamitous year therefore with a coarse but sincere stanza of 
my own, which I placed at the end of my ordinary memorandums die sanjt 
year they were written:— 

A dreadful plague in London was 
In the year sixty-five,
