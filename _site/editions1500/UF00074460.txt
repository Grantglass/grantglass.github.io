A. L. BURT, PUBLISHER.
I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a for-
eigner, of Bremen, who settled first at Hull ; he got a good
estate b merchandise, and leavin of his trade, lived after-
ward at ork ; from whence he he married my mother, whose
relations were named Robinson, a ve good family in that
country, and from whom I was called binson Kreutznaer ;
but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now
called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe ; and
so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colo-
nel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly com-
manded by the famous Colonel Lookhart, and was killed at
the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became
of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father
or mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts 5
my father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as house-education and a country free-
school generally goes, and designed me for the law ; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my in-
clination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the
commands, of my father, and against all the entreaties and
persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed
to be somethin fatal in that propension of nature, tending di-
rectly to the l' e of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excel-
lent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined b the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon
this su ject: he asked me what reasons, more than a mere
wandering inclination, I had for leaving my father's house and
my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had
a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry,2 ROBINSON causon.

with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of
desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes
on the other, who went abroad 11 on adventures, to rise by en-
terprise, and make themselves amous in undertakings of a
nature out of the common road; that these things were all
either too far above me or too far below me ; that mine was
the'middle state, or what might be called the upper station of
low life, which he had found by long ex erience was the best
state in the world, the most suited to iuman happiness, not
exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labor and suf-
ferin s of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rasse with the pride, quur , ambition, and envy of the upper
part of mankind. He tol me, I might judge of the hap-
piness of this state by this one thing, viz., that this was the
state of life which all other people envied; that kin s have
frequently lamented the miserable consequence 0 being
born to reat things, and wished they had been placed in
the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the
great ; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the just
standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have neither pov-
ert nor riches. -

file bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part
of mankind ; but that the middle station had the fewest disas-
ters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher
or lower part of mankind ; nay, they were not subjected to so
many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as
those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on
one hand, or by hard labor, want of necessaries, and mean or
insuflicient diet on the other hand, bring distempers upon them-
selves by the natural eonseauences of their way of living;
that the middle station of 1i e was calculated for all kind of
virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty
were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance,
moderation,quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions,
and all desirable pleasures, were the blessmgs attending the
middle station of life ; that this way men went silent] and
smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of It, not
embarrassed with the labors of the hands or of the head, not
sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with per-
plexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body
of rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy, nor the secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently through the world and sensibly
tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that-;uimzum(mm

they are happy and learning by every day's experience to know
it more sensibly.

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affection-
ate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself
into miseries whic Nature, an the station of l' e I was born
in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no
necessity of seeking my bread ; that he would do well for me,
and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station of life which
he had just been recommending to me ; and that if I was not
ve easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or
fau t that must hin er it ; and that he should have nothing to
answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me
against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a
word, that as he would do very kind things for me, if I would
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have
so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encoura e-
ment to o away ; and to close all, he told me I had my el er
brother or an example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country
wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him
to run into the army, where he was killed ; and though he said
he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in
mg recovery.

observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be
so himself--I say, I observed the tears run down his face very '
plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was
illed ; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke ofi the
discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no
more to me.

I was sincerely afiected with this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwise ? and I resolved not to think of going
abroad an more, but to settle at home according to my father's
desire. Byirt, alas I a few days were it all off ; and, in short,
to prevent any of my father's further importunities, in a few
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. However,
I did not act quite so hastily neither as the first heat of my
resolution prompted, but I took in mother at a time when I
thought her a little more pleasant t ian ordinary, and told her
that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world,
that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough
to go through with it, and my father had better give me his
consent than force me to go without it ; that I was now eighteen
years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, I should never
serve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if
I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more,
and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time
that I had lost.

This put in mother into a great passion; she told me she
knew it woul be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject ; that he knew too well what was my inter-
est to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt ; and
that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after
the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender
expressions as she knew my father had used to me ; and that,
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me ; but
I might depend I should never have their consent to it ; that
for her part, she would not have so much hand in my destruc-
tion; and I should never have it to say that my mother was
willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I
heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and
that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her
with a sigh : "That boy might be hap y if he would stay at
home ; but if he goes abroad, he will e the most miserable
wretch that ever was born ; I can give no consent to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though, in the mean time, I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated
wit 1 my father and mother about their being so posrtively de-
termined against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one da at Hull, whither I went casually,
and without any purpose 0 making an elopement at that time ;
but I say, being there, and one of my companions being going
by sea to London in his father's ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common allurement of a seafaring man,
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted
neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them
word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out asking God's blessing, or my father's, without an con-
sideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an il hour,
God knows, on the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a
ship bound for London. Never any young adventurer's mis-Gama Tam>> N Go '10 ESL--Page 4.
fortunes, I believe, began sooner or continued lOnger than
mine. The ship was no sooner got out of the Humber than the
wind began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightful
manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most
inexpressibl sick in body and terrified in mind. I began
now serious y to reflect u on what I had done, and how justly
I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the
good counsels of my parents, my,father's tears and my mother's
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind ; and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it
has come since, rcproached me with the contempt of advice,
and the breach of my duty to God and m father.

All this while the storm increased, an the sea went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since ;
no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was enough to
affect me then, whowas buta young sailor, and had never known
anything of the matter. I expected every wave would have
swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I
thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should
never rise more : in this agon of mind I made many vows and
resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my life in this
one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I
would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a
ship again while I lived ; that I would take his advice, and
never run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now
I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle
station of life, how easy, how comfortable he had lived all his .
days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea ; or troubles
on shore ; .and, in short, I resolved that I would, like a true,
re enting prodigal, 0 home to my father.

hese wuse and so er thoughts continued all the while the
storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day
the wind was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a
little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day,
being also a little seasick still ; but towards night the weather
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charmin fine even-
ing followed, the sun went down perfectly clear, an rose so the
next morning ; having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the
sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most de-
lightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more seasick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was
so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm
and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest my
good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had
enticed me away, comes to me.

" Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, " how
do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't
you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind ?"

" A capful, d'you call it '3" said I ; " 'twasa terrible storm."

"A storm, you fool, you ! " replies he; "do you call that
a storm ? why, it was nothing at all ; give us but a good shi
and sea-room, and we think nothing 0 such a squall of win
as that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let
us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that ; d'ye see
what charming weather 'tis now ? "

To make short this sad part of m stou , we went the wa
of all sailors; the punch was ma e, andI was made hal -
drunk with it ; and in that one night's wickedness I
drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the
sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled
calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my
thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being
swallowed up by the sea bein forgotten, and the current of
my former desires returned, entirely forgot the vows and

romises that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some
intervals of reflection ; and the serious thoughts did, as it
were, endeavor to return again sometimes ; but I shook them
off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper,
and applying m vself to drinking and company, soon mastered
the return of those fits, for so I called them ; and I had, in
five or six days, got as complete a victory over my conscience
as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it
could desire. But I was to have another trial for it still ; and
Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to
leave me entirely without excuse ; for if I would not take
this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess
both the dan er and the mercy.

The sixth ay of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth
Roads ; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz., at southwest, for seven or eight days,
durin which time a great many ships from Newcastle came
into t e same Roads, as the common harbor where the ships
mi ht wait for a wind for the Rivera

e had not, however, rid here so long, but we should haveao'nmsox causes. 7

tided it u the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and,
after we ad lain four or five days, blew very hard. How-
ever, the Roads being reckoned as ood as an harbor, the an-
chorage good, and our ground-tac le very strong, our men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger,
but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the
sea ; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased,
and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and
make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed,
and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we
thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon
which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we
rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to
the better end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the
seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the busi-
ness of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his
cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say, several
times, "Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost! we
shall be all undone l" and the like. During these first hurries
I was stupid, lying still in .my cabin, which was in the steer-
age, and cannot describe my temper. I could ill resume the
first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon, and
hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of death
had been past, and that this would be nothing too, like the
first ; but when the master himself came b me, as I said just
now, and said we should be all lost, I was readfully fri hted.
I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a ismal
sight I never saw; the sea ran mountains high, and broke
upon us every three or four minutes. When I could look
about, I could see nothing but distress round us ; two ships
that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board,
being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship which
rid about a mile ahead of us was founder-ed. Two more
ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the
Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast
standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much
laborin in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and
came c ose by us, running away with only their spritsail out
before the wind.

Toward evening the mate and boatswain begged the master
of our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he was
very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him
that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; and
when they had cut away the foremast, the mainmast stood
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to
cut that away also, and make a clear deck.

And one must judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a
fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this dis-
tance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in ten-
fold more horror of mind upon account of my former convic-
tions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself ; and these,
added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition
that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not
come yet ; the storm continued with such fury, that the sea-
men themselves acknowledged they had never scen a worse.
We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in
the sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she
would founder. It was my advantage, in one res ct, that
I did not know what they meant by founder, till inquired.
However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is not
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more
sensible than the rest, at their pra ers, and expecting every
moment when the shi would 0 to t )e bottom. In the middle
of the night, and un er all t e rest of our distresses, one of
the men, that had been down to see, cried out we had sprung
a leak; another said, there was four feet water in the hold.
Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my
heart, as I thought, died within me ; and Ifell backwards up-
on the side of my bed, where I sat, into the cabin. However,
the men roused me, and told me that I, that was able to do
nothing before, wasas well able to pump as another ; at which
I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very heartily.
While this was doing, the master seeing some light collicrs,
who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip, and
run away to the sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a
gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they
meant, thought the shi had broken, or some dreadful thing
happened. n a word, was so surprised that I fell down in a
swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life
to think of, nobody minded me or what was become of me ;
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; and
it was a great while before I came to myself.

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it
was apparent that the ship would founder; and though thenonmson' onuson. 9

storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into any port, so the master con-
tinued firing uns for help ; and a light ship, who had rid it
out just ahe of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard the boat came near us ; but it was
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near
the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and
venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope
over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great
length, which they after much labor and hazard took hold
of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into
their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we
were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship ; so
all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
shore as much as we could ; and our master romised them,
that if the boat was staved upon shore, he wouiil make it good
to their masterz'so partly rowing, and partly driving, our
boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore
almost as far as Winterton Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of
our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the
first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea.
I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the
seamen told me she was sinking ; for from the moment that
they rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said
to o in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, artly
wit fright, partly with horror of mind and the thong ts of
what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet laborin at
the car to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (w en,
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore)
a great many people running along the strand, to assist us
when we should come near; but we made but slow way to-'
wards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till,
being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls ofi to
the westward, towards Cromer, and so the land broke ofi a
little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though
not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked
afterwards>> on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates
of the town, who assigned us good uarters, as by particular
merchants and owners of shi s, and ad money given us suf-
ficient to carry us either to ondon 'or back to Hull, as we
thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem
of our blessed Saviour's parab e, had even killed the fatted
calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast
away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had
any assurances that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment, to go
home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to call
this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that
hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,
even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our
eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed un-
avoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible for
me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm
reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible obstructions as I had met with in my
first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The
first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which
was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the
town to several quarters ; I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and lookin very melancholy,
and shakina his head, he asked me how I id, and telling his
father who? was, and how I had come this voyage only for a
trial, in order to go farther abroad 2 his father turning to me
witha very grave and concerned tone, " Young man," says he,
" you ought never to go to sea any more ; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea
faring man." "\Vhy, sir," said I, " will you go to sea no
more?" " That is another case," said he ; "it is my calling,
and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a
trial, you see what a taste-Heaven has given you of what you
are to expect if you persist. Pei-ha 3 this has all befallen us
on your account, like Jonah in the s ip of Tarshish. Pray,"
continues he, " what are you ; and on what account did '01: go
to sea?" Upon that I told him some of my story; at t e end
of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion : " What
had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship ? I would not set my foot in the same ship
with thee again or a thousand pounds.' This indeed was, as
I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by
the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have
authority to go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely
to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin ; telling me I might see a visible hand
of Heaven against me. " And, young man," said he, "depend
upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will
meet with nothing but disasters and disappomtments, till your
father's words are fulfilled upon you."

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more ; which way he went I know not. As for me,
having some money in my pocket,I traveled to London b
land ; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles wit
myself what course of life I should take, and whether I should
go home or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
offered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me
how I should he laughed at among the nei hbors, and should
be ashamed to see, not my father and mot er only, but even
everybody else; from whence I have often since observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of man-
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to
sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the ac-
tion for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be es-
teemed wise men. '

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncer-
tain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead.
An irresistible reluctance continued to going home ; and as I
stayed a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in
were off ; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to a return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid
aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from my
father's house, which hurried me into the wild and indigested
notion of raising my fortune; and that impressed those con-
ceits so forcibl upon me, as to make me deaf to all good ad-
vice, and to tie entreaties and even the commands of my
father: I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I
went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as
our sailors vulgar-1y call it, a voyage to Guinea.'

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I

Coast, Ivory Coast, Gold Coast. Slave Coast, and Benin.
did not ship myself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed
have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same
time I should have learnt the duty and office of a foremast
man, and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a. master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for having money in
my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always go
on board in the habit of a gentleman ; and so I neither had
any business in the ship nor learnt to do any.

t was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company
in London, which does not always happen to such loose and
misguided young fellows as I then was ; the devil generally
not omitting to lay some snare for them very early; but it
was not so with me. I first got acquainted with the master
of aship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who,
having lad very good success there, was resolved to go again ;
this captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was
not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say Ihad
a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage
with him, I should be at no expense; I should be his mess-
mate and his companion ; and if I could carry anything
with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the
trade would admit ; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.

I embraced the offer ; and entering into a strict friendshig
with this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man,
went the vo age with him, and carried a small adventure with
me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend the cap-
tain, I increased very considerably ; for I carried about PS40
in such toys and miles as the captain directed me to buy.
This PS40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some
of my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe
got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as
that to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in
all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom also I got a
competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navi-
gation, learned how to keep an account of the ship's course, take
an observation, and, in short, to understand some things that
were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for, as he took de-
light to instruct me, I took delight to learn ; and, in a word, this
voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; for I brought
home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost PS300 ; and
this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so
com leted my ruin.

Ygt even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; particu-
larly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent
calenture by the excessive eat of the climate ; our principal
trading being on the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees
north, even to the line itself.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to
my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved
to go the same voyage again, and I embarked in the same
vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and
had now got the command of the ship. This was the un-
happiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not
carry quite PS100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had PS200
left which I had lodged with my friend's widow, who was very
just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage ;
and the first was this, viz., our ship making her course towards
the Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the
African shore, was surprised in the gray of the morning by a
Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all t e sail
she could make. We crowded also as much canvas as our
yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear;

at finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly
come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fi ht;
our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. A out
three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by
mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern,
as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that
side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made him
sheer OE again, after returning our fire, and curing in also
his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on
board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men
keeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to
defend ourselves ; but Iayin us on board the next time upon
our other uarter, he entefe sixty men upon our decks, who
immediate? fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging.
We plied t em with small-shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and
such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to
cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being
disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight wounded, we
were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sal-
lee, a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I
apprehended; nor was I carried up the country to the em-
peror's court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the14 nonmsor: canson.

captain of the rover as his proper rize, and made his slave,
being youner and nimble, and fit or his business. At this
surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was erfectly overwhelmed; and now I
looked back upon my fat ier's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable and have none to relieve me; which I
thought was now so eEectually brought to pass that I could
not be worse; for now the hand of Heaven had overtaken
me, and I was undone without redemption. But, alas! this
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will
appear in the sequel of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would some time or
other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man-
of-war; and that then I should be set at liberty. But this
ho e of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to sea,
he eft me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he
came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it; but found no way that had the least
probability in it; nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to that
would embark with me ; no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irish-
man, or Scotsman there but myself; so that for two years,
though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I
never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in
practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented its
self, which put the old thought of making some attempt for
my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home. longer
than usual without fitting out his s ll , which, as I heard, was
for want of money, he used, constant y, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnace, and go out into the road va~fishing; and as he always
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexterons in catching
fish ; insomueh that sometimes he would send me with a Moor,
one of his kinsmcu, and the youth the Moresco, as they called
him, to catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a-fishing with him in a calm
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and rowing we
knew not whither or which way, we labored all day, and all the
next night; and when the morning came, we found we had
pulled out to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that
we were at least two leagues from the land. However, we got
well in again, though with a great deal of labor, and some
danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morn-
in ; but particularly we were all very hungry.

fifut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more
care of himself for the future ; and having lying by him the
long-boat of our En lish ship which he had taken, he resolved
he would not go a'fis ing any more without a com ass and some
provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his s ip, who also
was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in
the middle of the long-boat, like that of abarge, with a place
to stand behind it to steer and haul home the main-sheet; and
room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.

She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of--mutton sail ; and
the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which In very
snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with a s ave or
two, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in
some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink; and
particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.

We went frequently outwith this boat a-fishing; and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without
me. It happened that he had ap ointed to go out in this boat,
either for pleasure or forfish, wit two or three Moors of some
distinction in that lace, and for whom he had provided
extraordinarily, and lad therefore sent on board the boat over-
night alarger store of provisions than usual; and had ordered
me to get ready three fusils' with powder and shot, which
were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of
fowling as well as fishing.

I got all things ready as he had directed; and waited the
next morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient" and
pendants out, and everything to accommodate his guests ;
when by and by my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put off going, from some business that fell out,
and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat and catch them some fish, and that his friends were
to sup at his house; he commanded me too, that as soon as I
had got some fish, I should bring it home to his house: all
which I prepared to do.

'Fusz'l, a French word. meaning a light musket or flrelock.

'Ancient, the old word, derived from the French caseigm, for a flag,
or the man who carries it.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little
shi at my command ; and my master being gone, I prepared
to urnish myself, not for fishin business, but for a voyage ;
though I knew not, neither did so much as consider,whither
fiwould steer; for anywhere to get out of that place was my

eslre.

M first contrivance was to make a pretense to speak to
this oor, to get something for our subsistence on board ; for
I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread.

He said that was true; so he brought a large basket of
rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh water,
into the boat. I knew where my atron's case of bottles stood,
which it was evident, by the ma e, were taken out of some
English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the
Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for our
master. I conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the
boat, which weighed about half an hundredweight, with a
parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer,
all of which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the
wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which
he innocently came into also; his name was Ismael, which
they call Muley, or Moely ; so I called to him : " Moely," said I,
" our patron's guns are all on board the boat ; can you not get a
little powder and shot ? It may be we may kill some alcamies
[a fowl like our curlews] for ourselves, for I know he keeps
the gunner's stores in the ship." "Yes," says be," I'll bring
some ; " accordingly, he brought a great leat er pouch, which
held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more ; and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some
bullets, and put all into the boat. At the same time, I had
found some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with
which I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was
almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and thus
furnished With everything needfnl, we sailed out of the port
to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were, and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a
mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and sat
us down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E., which was
contra to my desire ; for bad it blown southerly, I had been
sure to ave made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to
the bay of Cadiz ; but my resolutions were, blow which way it
would, I would be gone from that horrid place where I was,

and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for
when I had fish on m hook I would not pull them up, that he
might not see them, said to the Moor, "This will not do ;
our master will not be thus served ; we must stand farther
off." He, thinking no harm, agreed, and, being in the head
of the boat, set the sails ; and, as I had the helm, I ran
the boat out near a league farther, and then brought her to as
if I would fish ; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped for-
ward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for
something behind him, I took him by surprise With my
arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into
the sea. _

He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to
me, begged to be taken in, telling me he would go all over
the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that
he would have reached me very quickly, there being but little
wind; upon which I ste ped into the cabin, and fetching one
of the fowling-pieces, presented it at him and told him
I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would
do him none. "But," saidrI, " you swim well enough to
reach the shore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your
way to shore, and I will do you no harm; but if you come
near the boat, I'll shoot yOu through the head, for I am re-
solved to have my libert ," So he turned himself about, and
swam for the shore, an I make no doubt but he reached
it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to
trust him. When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom
they called Xur , and said to him, "Xury, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make yo'u a great man ; but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet
and his father's beard, " I must throw you into the sea too."
The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently that I could
not mistrust him, and swore to be faithful to me and go all
over the world with me.

While I was in the view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea, with the boat rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards the Straits' '
mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do) ; for who would have supposed we
were sailin. on to the southward to the truly barbarian coast,
where who e nations of negroes were sure to surround us with
their canoes, and destroy us; where we could never once go

on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more
merciless savages of human kind?

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little towards the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth,

uiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day at
t ree o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I
could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south
of Sallee ; quite be road the Emperor of Morocco's dominions,
or indeed of any ot er king thereabouts, for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, the wind
continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner five days ; and
then, the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over ; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what
nor where; neither what latitude, what country, what nation,
or that river. I neither saw, nor desired to see any people;
the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. "'e came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon
as it was dark, and discover the country; but as soon as it
was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the barking,
roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged of me not to 0 on shore till day. "Well, Xury,"
said I, " then I won't; ut it may be we ma see men by day,
who will be as bad to us as those lions." " ' 'hen we give them
the shoot un," says Xury, laughing, " make them run wey."
Such Eng ish Xury spoke by conversin among us slaves.
However, I was glad to see the boy so c eerful, and I gave
him a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him
up. After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it : we
dropped our little anchor, and lay still all night; I say still,
for we slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast
great creatures (we knew not what to call them), of many
sorts, come down to the seashore, and run into the water,
wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling
themselves; and they made such hideoushowlings and yellings
that I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both more frightcd when we heard one mighty
creature come swimming toward our boat ; we could not see
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous,
huge, and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might
be so for aught I know ; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh
the anchor and row away. " No," says I, "Xury ; we can
slip our' cable, with the buoy to it, and go to sea ; they cannot
follow us far." I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the
creature, whatever it was, within two oars' length, which some-
thing surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to the
cabin-door, and taking up my gun, fired at him ; upon which
he immediately turned about, and swam towards the shore
a am.

gBut it is im ossible to describe the horrid noises, and hide-
ous cries and owlings that were raised, as well upon the edge
of the shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or
report of a gun, a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before. This convinced me that
there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast ;
and how to venture on shore in the day was another ques-
tion too ; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions
and tigers ; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger
of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had nota pint left in the boat ;
when or where to get it was the oint. Xury said, if I would
let him go on shore with one of t )6 jars, he would find if there
was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he
would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the boat? The
boy answered with so much afi'ection that made me love him
ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come, they eat me, you 0
wey." " Well, Xury," said I, " we will both go, and if the wi d
mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us."
So I gave Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of
our patron's case of bottles which I mentioned before ; and we
hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper,
and waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms and two
jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the com-
ing of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy, see-
ing a low lace about amile up the country, rambled to it, and
by and by& saw him come running towards me. I thought he
was pursued by some savage, orfrighted with some wild beast,
and I ran forward towards him to helphim ; but when I came
nearer to him I saw something hanging over his shoulders,
which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but diiferent in
color, and Ian or legs ; however, we were very lad of it, and it
was very oo meat ; but the great joy poor ury came with,
was to tel me he had found good water, and seen no wild
mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such phins
for water, for a little higher up the creek where we were we
found the water fresh when the tide was out, which flows but
a little way up ; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare
we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no
footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voya e to this coast before, I knew very
well that the islands of t e Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
Islands also, lay not far 0E from the coast. But as I had no
instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactl know, or at least not remember,
what latitude they were in, knew not where to look for them,
or when to stand off to sea towards them ; otherwise I might
now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope
was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part
where the English traded, I should find some of their vessels
upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take
us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was
must be that country which, lying between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the negroes, lies waste and unin-
habited, except by wild beasts ; the negroes having abandoned
it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moors; and the
Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its bar-
renness; and indeed both forsaking it because of the pro-
digious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other famous
creatures which harbor there; so that the Moors use it for
their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time : and indeed, for near a hundred miles
together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste unin-
habited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and
roarings of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico of
Tenerifie, being the high top of the mountain Tenerilfe in the
Canaries ; and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of
reaching thither ; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrarIy winds, the sea also going too high for my
little vessel ; so resolved to pursue my first design, and keep
along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place ; and once in particular, being early in
the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of
land, which was pretty high ; and the tide beginning to flow,
we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more
about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells
me that we had best go farther off the shore 5 " for," says he,
" look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hil-
lock, fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, and saw a dread-
ful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that lay on
the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of a hill that
hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," says I "you shall
go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frighted and said,
"Me kill? he eat me at one mouth ; " one mouthful he meant.
However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him be still, and
took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs,
and laid it down ; then I loaded another un with two bullets ;
and the third (for we had three pieces I loaded with five
smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first
piece to have shot him in the head, but he lay so, with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about
the knee, and broke the bone. He started up, growling at
first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again ; and then got
up u on three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I
hear . I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the
head ; however, I took up the second piece immediately, and
though he began to move ofi, fired again, and shot him in the
head, and had the pleasure to see him drop ; and making but
little noise, he lay struggling for life. Then Xury took heart,
and would have me let him go on shore. " Well, go, " said
I ; so the boy jumped into the water, and taking the little gun
in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear,
and shot him in the head again, which dispatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot 11 on
a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, ury
said he would have some of him ; so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. " For what, Xury ?" said
I. "Me cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could
not cut 0E his head, but he out 01f a foot, and brought it
with him, and it was a monstrous great one.

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him
might, one way or other, he of some value to us ; and I re-
solved to take off his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to
work with him; but Xury was much the better workman at
it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us up both
the whole day, but at last we got ed the hide of him, and
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried
it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward continually
for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions,
which began to abate very much, and going no oftener into
the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water. My de-
sign in this was to make the River Gambia or Senegal ; that
is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I was in
hopes to meet with some European ship ; and if I did not, I knew
not what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or
erish there among the negroes. I knew that all the ships
rom Europe which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those islands ;
and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single
point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.
When I had ursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon the shore to look at us; we could also perceive
they were quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them ; but Xury was my better coun-
selor, and said to me, "No go, no go." However, I hauled
in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I found
they ran along the shore by me a good way : I observed they
had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had 3. Ion
slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they coul
throw them a great way with good aim : so I ke t at a distance,
but talked with them by signs as well as I con 6. ; and partic-
ularly made signs for something to eat : they beckoned to me
to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon
this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay b , and two of them
ran up into the country, and in less than iii" an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and
some corn, such as is the produce of their country; but we
neither knew what the one nor the other was: however, we
were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next
dispute, for I would not venture on shore to them, and the
were as much afraid of us : but they took a safe way for us a] ,
for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went
and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then
came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends ; but an opportunity oifered that very in-
stant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying
on the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the
other (as we took it) with great fury from the mountains to-
wards the sea ; whether it was the male pursuing the female,
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,
any more than we could tel whether it was usual .or strange :
but I believe it was the latter; because, in the first place,
these ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and,
in the second place, we found the people terribly frighted,
especially the women. The man that had the lance or dart
did not fly from them, as the rest did ; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water, they did not ofler to fall
upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea,
and swam about, as if they had come for their diversion : at
last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first
I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my
gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired,
and shot. him directly in the head ; immediatel he sank down
into the water, but rose instantly, and plunge up and down,
as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed he was ; he im-
mediately made to the shore ; but between the wound, which
was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died
just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of m gun ; some of them were
ready even to die for fear, and fell own as dead with the very
terror. But when they saw the creature dead, and sunk into
the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and began to search for the creature. I
found him by his blood staining the water: and by the help
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to
haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a
most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable de-
gree; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration,
to think what it was I killed him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the
noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran up directly to
the mountains from whence they came ; nor could I at that
distance know what it was. I found quickly the negroes
were-for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
to have them take it as a favor from me; which, when I
made signs to them that the might take it, they were very
thankful for. Immediately t ey fell to work with him ; and
though they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood,24 nonmsox CRUSOE.

they took off his skin as readily, and much more readily, than
we would have done with a knife. The oifered me some of
the flesh, which I declined, makin as if would give it them ;
but made signs for the skin, whic 1 they gave me very freel ,
and brought me a' great deal more of their (provision, which,
though I did not understand, yet I accepte . Then I made
signs to them for some water, and held out one of my jars to
them, turning its bottom u ward, to show that it was empty,
and that I wanted to have it filled. They called immediately
to some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt as I su pose
in the sun ; this they set down for me, as before, and sent
Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The
women were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was,
and water ; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward
for about eleven days more, without ofiering to go near the
shore, till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea,
at about the distance of four or five leagues before me ; and
the sea being very calm, I kept a large ofling to make this
point. At lengI h, doubling t e (point at about two leagues
from the land, saw plainly Ian on the other side, to sea-
ward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that
this was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands called, from
thence, Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great
distance, and I could not well tell what I had best do ; for if
I should be taken with a fresh gale of wind, I might neither
reach one nor other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a
sudden, the b0 cried out, " Master, master, a shi with a sail ! "
and the foolisr boy was frighted out of his wrts, thinking it
must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us,
when I knew we were gotten 'far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the
ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea, for negroes. But, when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they
were bound some other way, and did not design to go any
nearer the shore: upon which I stretched out to the sea as
much as I could, resolving to s eak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could ma e, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before
I could make any signal to them : but after I had crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their erspective glasses, and that it was some Eu-
ropean boat, whic they supposed must belong to some sni
that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I
was encouraored with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on
board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress,
and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these
signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me ; and
in about three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and
in French, but I understood none of them ; but at last a Scotch
sailor, who was on board, called to me : and I answered him,
and told him I was an Englishman, that had made In escape
out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee; they then ade me
come on board, and ver kindly took me in, and all my goods.

It was an inex ressihle joy to me, which any one will be-
lieve, that I was 1; us delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a
miserable and almost hopeless condition as I was in ; and I
immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told me he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be de-
livered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. " For," says
he, " I have saved your life on no other terms than as I would
be glad to be saved myself ; and it may, one time or other, be
my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides," said
be, "when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from
your own country, if I should take from you what you have,

on will be starved there, and then I only take away that life
lhave iven. No, no," says he; "Seignor Inglese [Mn Eng-
lishman , I will carry you thither in charity, and these things
will help you to buy your subsistence there, and your passage
home again."

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle ; for he ordered the seamen that none
should offer to touch anything I had : then he took everything
into his own ossession, and gave me back an exact inventory
of them, that might have them, even to my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use; and
asked me what I would have for it. I told him, he had been
so generous to me in everything, that I could not offer to make
any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him : upon which,
he told me he would ive me a note of his hand to pa me
eighty pieces of eight or it at Brazil ; and when it came t iere,
if any one ofiered to give more, he would make it up. He of-
feted me also sixty pieces of eight more for m boy Xury,
which I was loath to take ; not that I was unwilling to let the
captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in rocuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reason, e owned it to he
just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Chris-
tian : upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him,
I let the captain have him.

"'e had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in about twenty-
two days after. And now I was once more delivered from
the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do
next with myself I was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me,I can never
enough remember: he would take notlnng of me for my pas-
sage, gave me twent ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty
for the lion's skin, w rich I had in my boat, and caused every-
thing I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me ; and
What I was willing to sell, he bought of me : such as the case of
bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-
wax, for I had made candles of t e rest; in a word, I made
about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo ;
and with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, but being recommended to the
house of a good, honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio,
as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house), I lived
with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that means,
with the manner of their planting and making of sugar ; and
seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich sud--
denly, I resolved, if I could get a license to settle there, I would
turn planter among them ; resolving in the mean time, to find
out some way to get my money, which I had left in London,
remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of
naturalization, I purchased as much land that was uncured as
my money would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation
and settlement ; such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him neighbor, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociahly
together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than anything else, for about two
years. However, we began to increase, and our land began
to come into order; so that the third year we planted some
tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready
for planting canes in the year to come; but we both wanted
help ; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong
in arting with my boy Xury. '

ut, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no remedy but to go on ; I had got into
an employment uite remote to my genius and directly con-
trary to .the life delighted in, and for which I forsook m
father's house, and broke through all his good advice ; nay,
was comin into the very middle station, or upper degree of
low life, w ich my father advised me to before, and which, if
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have stayed at home,
and never fatigued myself in the world, as I have done ; and
I used often to say to myself, "I could have done this as well
in England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand
miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness,
and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me."

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbor ; no work to be done, but by the labor of
my hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men
reflect, that when they compare their present conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may ob ige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicit by their
experience: I say, how just has it been, that the tru y solitary
life I reflected on, in an island, or mere desolation, should be
my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life
which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all prob-
ability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures 'for carrying
on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the
ship that took me u at sea, went back; for the shi remained
there, in providing er lading, and preparing for t e vo age,
near three months ; when, telling him what little stock had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friend! and sincere
advice: "Seignor Inglese," says he (for so he a ways called
me), "if you will give me letters, and a procuration in form
to me, with orders to the person who has your money in Lon-
don, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall
direct, and in such goods as are proper for this country, I \\"ll
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my return;
but, since human afiairs are all subject. to chan es and disasters,
I would have you give orders but for one undred pounds
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard
be run for the first; so that, if it come safe, you may order
the rest the same way ; and if it miscarry, you may have the
other half to have recourse to for your sup ly."

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friend] , that
I could not but be convinced it was the best course could
take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentleman with
whom I had left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain, as he desired"

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all
my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with
the Portuguese captain at sea, the humanit of his behavior,
and what condition I was now in, with al other necessary
directions for my supply ; and when this honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over not the order only, but a full account of my
story, to a merchant in London, who represented it efiectually
to her; whereupon she not only delivered the mone , but out
of her own ockct sent the Portugal captain a very andsome
present for his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London vested this hundred pounds in
English goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me
to the Brazils ; among which, without my direction (for I
was too youn in my business to think of them), he had
taken care to rave all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils
necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made; for
I was surprised with the joy of it; and my good steward the
captain had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had
sent him for a present for himself, to purchase and bring me
over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which
I would have him accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all; for my goods being all English manu~
facture, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell
them at a very great advantage ; so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now in-
finitely beyoud my poor neighbor--I mean in the advance-
ment of my plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought me
a negro slave, and an European servant also : Imean another
besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused rosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our greatest a versity, so was it with me. I went on the
next year with great success in my plantation : I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more thanI had

isposed of for necessaries among my neighbors; and these
fifty rolls, bein each of above a hundredweight, were well
cured, and laid. y against the return of the fleet from Lisbon.
And now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to
be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach ; such
asare indeed often the ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for
all the happy things to have yet befallen me for which my
father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life
to be full of ; but other things attended me, and I was still
to be the willful agent of all my own miseries ; and par-
ticularly, to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon
myself, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to
make; all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent
obstinate adherin to my foolish inclination of wandering
abroad, and pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the
clearest views of doin myself good in a fair and Iain pursuit
of those prospects an those measures of life, whic nature and
grovidence concurred to present me with, and to make my

ut .

13s I had once done thus in breakin away from in parents,
so I could not be content now, but must go and leave the
happy view I had of beiiiga rich and thriving man in my new
plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of
rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted ; and thus
I cast myself down again into the deepest ulf of human
misery that ever man fell into, or erhaps coul be consistent
with life and a state of health in t e world.

To come, then, by just degrees to the particulars of this part
of my story : You may suppose, that having now lived almost
four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and rosper
very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned t e lan-
guage, but ad contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as amon the merchants at St.
Salvadore, which was our port ; an that, in my discourse
among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with
the negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast for trifles--such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets,
bits of glass, and the like--not only gold-dust, Guinea grains,
elephants' teeth, etc., but negroes, for the service of the Brazils,
in great numbers.

' hey listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only
not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on
by the Assiento, or permission of the King of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock ; so that few
ne roes were brought, and those excessively dear.

t happened, being in company one day with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next
mornin , and told me they had been musing very much upon
what I ad discoursed of with them the last night, and they
came to make a secret pro osal to me; and after enjoining
.me secrecy, they told me t at the had a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea ; that they ha all plantations as well as
I, and were straitened for nothin so 'much as servants ; that
as it was a trade that could not 9 carried on, because they
could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so
they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on
shore privately, and divide them among their own plantations ;
and, in a word, the question was, whether I would go their
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the
coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should have my
equa'l share of the negroes, without providing any part of the
stoc .

This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation
of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming
to be very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But
for me, that was thus entered and established, and had nothing
to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more,
and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from England ;
and who in. that time, and with that little addition, could
scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand
pounds sterling, and that increasing too--for me to think of
such a voyage was the most reposterous thing that ever man
in such circumstances could e guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling
designs when my father's good counsel was lost upon me.
In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it as I should direct, if I miscarried.CRIJSOE AND THE CAI'I'AIS Coxsuu'lso THE CuAn'rs.--l'age 31.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings, or
covenants, to do so; and Imade a formal will, disposing of
my plantation and eifects in case of my death, making the
captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my
universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my efiects as
had directed in my wi l; one-half of the produce being to
himself, and the other to be shipped to England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my efiects,
and to keep up my plantation. Had I used half as much
prudence to have looked into my own interest, and have made
a judgment of what I ought to have done, and not to have
done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thrivin cir-
cumstance, and gone upon a voyage to 'sea, attended wit all
its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to
ex ect articular misfortunes to myself.

ut was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy rather than my reason ; and accordingly, the ship
being fitted out, and the cargo finished, and all things done as
by agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on board
in an evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1659, being the
same day eight years that I went from my father and mother
at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the
fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden,
carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides the master,'his
boy, and myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes,
such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially
little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing awa
to the northward upon our own coasts, with design to stretch
over for the African coast, when they came into about ten or
twelve de rees of northern latitude ; which, it seems, was the
manner 0 their course in those days. We had very good
weather, only excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast,
till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino ; from whence,
keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as
if we were bound for the Isle Fernando de Noronha, holding
our course N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east.
In this course we assed the line in about twelve days' time,
and were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty.
two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or
hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began from
the southeast, came about to the northwest, and then settled
into the northeast; from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing
but drive, and, scudding awa before it, let it carry us wher-
ever fate and the fury of t e winds 'directed; and during
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected every day
to be swallowed up 3 nor did any in the ship expect to save
their lives.

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one
of our men died of the calenture, and aman and a boy washed
overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a
little, the master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about eleven degrees of north lati-
tude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of Ion itude differ-_
ence west from Cape St. Augustine; so that he ound he was
gotten u on the coast of Guiana, or the north art of Brazil,
beyond t e river Amazones, towards that of t e river Oroo-
noque, commonly called the Great River; and now he began to
consult with me what course he should take ; for the ship was
leaky, and very much disabled, and he was for going directly
back to the coast of Brazil.

I was positively a ainst that; and looking over the charts
of the seacoast of merica with him, we concluded there
was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we
came within the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and therefore
resolved to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping OR
at sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail ;
whereas we could not possibly make our voya e to the coast
of Africa without some assistance both to Our s ip and to our-
selves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away
N.W. b W., in order to reach some of our English islands,
where {ho ed for relief ; but our voyage was otherwise de-
termined; or, being in the latitude of twelve de rees ei ht-
een minutes, a second storm came upon us, whic carrie us
away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so
out of the way of all human commerce that, had all our lives
been saved as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being
devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our
men early one morning cried out, "Land !" and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck upon
the sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea
broke over her in such a manner that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were even driven into
our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray
of the sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like con-
dition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such
circumstances. We knew nothing where we were,'or upon
what land it was we were driven; whether an island or the
main, whether inhabited or not inhabited. As the rage of the
wind was still great, though rather less than at first, we could
not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes with-
out breaking in pieces, unless the wmds, by a kind of miracle,
should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking
one upon another, and expecting death every moment, and
everiman acting accordingly, as pre aring for another world ;
for t ere was little or nothing more or us to do in this ; that
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort we had,
was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not break
yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.

Now, though we thought the wind did a little abate, yet the
ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast
for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful con-
dition indeed, and ha nothing to do but to think of saving
our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern
just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk, or was driven 05 to sea ; so there was
no hope from her. We had another boat on board, but how.
to get her olf into the sea was a doubtful thing; however
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship woul
break in pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already. '

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her flung
over the ship's side ; and getting all into her, we let go, and
committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy
and the wild sea : for though the storm was abated consider-
ably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore, and
might be well called den wild ace, as the Dutch call the sea in
a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw
plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not
escape, and that we should be inevrtably drowned. As to mak-
ing sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could we have done
anything with it ; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution ; for
we all knew that when the boat came near the shore, she
would be dashed ina thousand pieces b the breach of the sea.
However, we committed our souls to od in the most earnest
manner ; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well
as we could towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep
or shoal, we knew not' ; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation was, if we might hap-
pen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where

y great chance we mi ht have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, an perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this ap cared; but as we made nearer
and nearer the shore, the lan looked more frightful than the
sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came
rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de
grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury that it overset
the boat at once ; and separating us as well from the boat as
from one another, ave us not time hardly to say, " 0 God!"
for we were all swa lowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt,
when I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw
breath, till that wave havin driven me, or rather carried me,
a vast way on towards the s ore, and havin spent itself, went
back, and left me u on the land almost ry, but half dead
with the water I too in. I had so much presence of mind,
as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland
than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make
on towards the land as fast as I could, before another wave
should return and take me up again ; but I soon found it was
impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as
high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had
no means or strength to contend with: my business was to
hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could ;
and so by swimming to preserve my breathing, and pilot my-
self towards the shore 1f possible, my greatest concern now
being, that the wave, asit would carry me a great we to-
wards the shore when it came on, might not carry me aok
again with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty
or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself
carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a'pa axed---auonsv mm aosmlononmsox meson. 85

very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to
swim still forward with all my mi ht. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when as I elt myself rising up, so, to
my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out
above the surface of the water; and though it was not two
seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was covered
again wit water a good while, but not so lon but I held it out ;
and finding the water had spent itself, and egan to return, I
struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover
breath, and till the waters--went from me, and then took to my
heels, and ran with what stren th I had, farther towards the
shore. But neither would this eliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me again; and twice more I
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, the
shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well-ni h been fatal to me ;
for the sea having hurried me along, as efore, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body ; and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water;
but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and
seeing I should be covered again with water, I resolved to hold
fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible,
till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high
as at first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so
near the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me,
yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the
next run I took, I got to the mainland ; where, to my reat
comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore, and sat'me down
upon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of
the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there
was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe
it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out
of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at that custom,
when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied
up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought
to him--I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with
it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that
the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart,
and overwhelm him,

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole
being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of m deliv-
erance ; making a thousand gestures and motions, whic l I can-
not describe ; reflecting upon all my comrades that were
drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved but my-
self ; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign
of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far
off; and considered, Lord ! how was it possible I could get on
shore ?

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable art of my
condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place
I was in, and what was next to be done: and I soon found my
comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliver-
ance : for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything
either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any
prospect before me but that of (perishing with hunger, or being
devoured by wild beasts : an that which was particularly
afllicting to me was that I had no weapon, either to hunt and
kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against
any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In
a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe,
and a little tobacco in a box . This was all my provision ; and
this threw me into terrible agonics of mind, that for a while I
ran about like a madman. I\ight coming u on me, I began,
with a heavy heart, to consider what would fie my lot if there
were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they
always come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time,
was to get up into a thick, bush tree, like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where resolved to sit all night, and
consider the next day what death I should die, for as et I saw
no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from t e shore,
to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to
my great joy; and having drunk, and put a little tobacco in
my mouth to prevent hunger, Iwent to the tree, and getting
up into it, endeavored to place myself so that if I should sleep
I might not fall. And having cut me a short stick, like anosmsoN 011115012. 37

tmncheon, for my defense, I took up my lodging; and being
excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my con ition, and found
myself more refreshed with it than I think I ever was on such
an occasion.

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before ;
but that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swellin
of the tide, and was driven u almost as far as the rock whic
I at first mentioned, where I lad been so bruised by the wave
dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright
still, I wished myself on board, that at least might save some
necessary things for m use.

When I came down rom my apartment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first thin I found was the boat,
which lay, as the wind and sea ha tossed her up, upon the
land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as
I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a neck
or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about
half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more
intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find some-
thing for m present subsistence.

A little a ter noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile
of the ship. And here I found a fresh renewmg of my grief ;
for I saw evidently that, if we had kept on board, we had
been all safe ; that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and
I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears to
my eyes again ; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved,
if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off my clothes, for the
weather was hot to extremity, and took the water. But when I
came to the ship. my difficulty was still greater to know how
to get on board ; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I
swam round her twice, and the second time I cspied a small
piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hanging
down by the fore-chains so low, that with great difficulty got
hold of it, and by the he] of that rope got up into the fore-
castle of the ship. Here found that the ship was bulged, and
had a great deal of water in her hold ; but that she lay so on
the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern
lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the
water. By this means all her quarter was free and all that
was in that art was dry; for you may be sure my first work
was to searc , and to see what was spelled and what was free.
And, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry and
untouched by the water, and bein very well disposed to eat,
I went to the breadsroom, and fil ed my pockets with biscuit,
and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to
lose. I also found some rum in the teat cabin, of which I
tooka lar e dram, and which Ihad, in eed, need enough of to
spirit me or what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but
a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me. .

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be
had; and this extremity roused my a plication. We had
several spare yards, and two or three arge spars of wood,
and a spare topmast or two in the ship: I resolved to fall to
work With them, and I flung as many of them overboard as I
could manage for their weight, tyin every one with a rope,
that they might not drive away. I'Vhen this was done, I
went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four
of them together at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of
a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them,
crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to hear an great weight, the pieces bein too
light. So I went to wor , and with the ca enter's saw cut
a spare topmast into three lengths, and a ded them to my
raft, with a great deal of labor and pains. But the hope of
furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go
beyond what I should have been able to have done upon
another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea: but I
was not long in considering this. I first laid all the planks
or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well
what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them
down upon my raft; the first of these I filled with provisions
--viz.,bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh which we lived much u on), and a little re-
mainder of are can corn, which had een laid by for some
fowls which we rought to sea with us, but the fowls were
killed. There had been some barley and wheat together;
but, to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the
rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found'V
several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which
were some cordial waters ; and in all, about five or six
gallons of arrack. These I stowed by themselves, there being
no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them.
While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow,
though very calm; and I had the mortification to see my
coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the
sand, swim away. As for my breeches, which were only
linen, and o en-kneed, I swam on board in them and my
stockings. owever, this put me upon rummagin for
clothes, of which I found enou h, but took no more t an I
wanted for present use, for I ha other things which my eye
was more 11 on; as, first, tools to work with on shore ; and it
was after ong searching that I found out the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much
more valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have been at
that time. I at it down to m raft, whole as it was, without
losin time to col: into it, for knew in general what it con-
tains .

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There
were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and. two
pistols. These I secured first, with some powder-horns, a
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of powder in the shi , but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them ; but wit much search I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water.
Those two I got to my raft. With the arms. And now I thought
myself retty well freighted, and began to think how I should
get to s ore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder;
and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navi-
gation.

I had three encouragements: first, a smooth, calm sea;
secondly, the tide rising, and setting in to the shore; thirdly,
what little wind there was blew me towards the land. And
thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to the
boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, two saws,
an ax, and a hammer; with this cargo I ut to sea. For a
mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very we 1, only that I found
it drive a little distant from the lace where I had landed be-
fore ; by which I perceived that t ere was some indraft of the
water, and consequently, I hoped to find some creek or river
there, which I might make use of as a port to get to land with
my cargo. -

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a lit-
tle opening of the land. I found a strong current of the tide
set into'it ; so I guided my raft as well as I could, to keep in
the middle of the stream.

But here I had like to have sufiered a second shipwreck,
which, if I had, I think verily would have broken my heart ;
for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one
end of it u on a shoal, and not being aground at the other end,
it wanted guts. little that all in cargo had slipped off towards
the end that was afloat, and so allen into the water. I did my
utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep them
in their places, but could not thrust of the raft with all my
strength ; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in ; but
holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that man-
ner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water
brought me a little more upon a level ; and, a ittle after, the
water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off
with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up higher,
I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up.
I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I
was not willing to be driven too hi up the river ; hoping in
time to see some ship at sea, and t erefore resolved to place
myself as near the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the

creek, to which, with great pain and difliculty, I guided my
raft, and at last got so near that, reaching ground With my car,
I could thrust her direct] in. But here I had like to have
dipped all my cargo into t e sea again ; for that shore lying
pretty steep--that is to say, slo ing--there was no place to
and, but where one end of my oat, if it ran on shore, would
lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would
endanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait
till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar
like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a
flat piece of ground, which I ex ected the water would flow
over ; and so it did. As soon as found water enough, for my
raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her upon that flat
piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking
my two broken oars into the ground--one on one side, near
onelend, and one on the other side, near the other end ; and
thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all
my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow m goods, to secure
them from whatever might happen. Whered was, I yet knew
not 3 whether on the continent or an island 3 whether inhabitedYllt'

or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts or not.
There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very
steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills,
which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took out one of
the fowhng-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of pow-
der ; and thus armed, I traveled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labor and difficulty
got to the top, I saw my fate, to my great affliction--via, that
I was in an island environed every way with the sea : no land
to be seen except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and
two small islands, less than this, which lay about three leagues
to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
of which, however, I saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls,
but knew not their kinds ; neither, when I killed them, could
I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree,
on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun
that had been fired there since the creation of the world. I
had no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there
arose an innumerable number of fowls of many sorts, making
a confused screaming and crying, every one according to his
usual note, but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As
for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its
color and beak resemblin it, but it had no talons or claws
more than common. Its esh was carrion, and fit for nothing,

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the
rest of the day : what to do with myself at night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast micrht devour me ;
though, as I afterwards found, there was reaIly no need for
those fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made
a kind of but for that night's lodging. As for food, 1 yet saw
not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like ares, run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet et a great many
things out of the ship, which would be usefu to me, and par-
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to land ; and I resolved to make another voy-
age on board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that-the
first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in ieees, I
resolved to set all other things apart, till I got everyt ing out
of the ship that I could get. Then I called a council--that is
to say, in my thoughts--whether I should take back the raft;
but this appeared impracticable : so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down ; and I did so, only that I stripped be-
fore I went from my hut, having nothing on but a checkered
shirt, a pair of linen-drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft ; and, having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me ; as, first, in the carpen-
ter's stores I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes,a
great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all,
that most useful thin called a grindstone. All these I secured,
together with severe. things belongin to the unner, particu-
larly two or three iron crows, and two arrels o musket bullets,
seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small
quantity of powder more; a large bagful of small shot, and
a great roll of sheet lead ; but this last was so heavy I could
not hoist it up to get it over the ship's sides.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I
could find, and a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some
beddin ; and with this I loaded l{my second raft, and brought
them safe on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehension during my absence from the
land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore ;
but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor ; only
there sat a creature like a wildcat, upon one of the chests,
which when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and
then stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned, and
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted
with me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not
understand it, she was perfectl unconcerned at it, nor did she
offer to stir away ; upon whici I tossed her a bit of biscuit,
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great; however, I spared her a bit, I sa , and she
went to it, smelled at it, and ate it, and looked as pleased)
for more ; but I thanked her, and could spare no more; so she
marched of.

Havin got my second cargo on shore--th ough I was obliged
to open t e barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for
they were too heavy, being large casks--I went to work
to make me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles which
I cut for that purpose ; and into this tent I brought every-
thin that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun ; and I
pile all the empt chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it rom any sudden attempt, either from man
or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end
without; and spreading one of the eds upon the ground,
laying my two pistols 'ust at my head, and my gun at length
by me, I went to bed t e first time, and slept very quietly all
night. I was very weary and heavy ; for the night before I
had slept little, and had labored very hard all day, as well to
to fetch those things from the ship as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was
laid up, I believe,for one man ; but still Iwas not satisfied, for
while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought
to get ever thing out of her that could ; so every day, at
low water, went on board, and brought awa something or
other ; but particularly the third time I went, brought away
as much of the riggino as I could, as also all the small ropes
and rope twine cotfid get, with a piece of s are canvas,
which was to mend the sails u on occasion, and t e barrel of
wet gunpowder. In a word I rought away all the sails, first
and last ; only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and
bring as much at a time as I could, for they were no more useful
to me for sails, but as mere canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still was, that at last of
all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and
thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was
worth my meddling with--I say, after all thus, I found a great
hogshead of bread, three large runlets of rum, or spirits, a
box of fine sugar, and a barrel of fine fiour : this was surprising
to me, because I had given over expecting any more provisions
exce t what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the
hogs ead of the bread, and wrapped it u , parcel by parcel,
in pieces of the sails, which I cut out ; and: in a word, I got all
this safe on shore also, though at several times.

The next da I made another voyage, and now, having

lundered the s ip of what was portable and fit to hand out,

began with the cable ; cutting the great cable into pieces
such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the ironwork I could get ; and having cut down the
spritsail-yard and the mizzen-yard, and everything I could to
make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods and
came away ; but my good luck began to leave me, for this raft
was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was entered the
little cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not bein
able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and
threw me and all my cargo into the water ; as for myself, it
was no great harm, for I was near the shore ; but as to my
cargo, it was reat part lost, especially the iron, which I ex-
pected would lave been of great use to me ; however, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and
some of the iron, though with infinite labor ; for I was fain to
dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very
much. After this, I went every day on board, and brought
awa what I could get. '

I had now been thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship, in which time I had brought away
all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable of
bringin ; though I verily believe, had the calm weather held,
I shoulg have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece ;
but preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the
wind began to rise : however, at low water I went on board,
and though I thought I had ru m maged the cabin so efiectually
that nothing more could be found, et I discovered a locker
with drawers in it, in one of whic I found two or three
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen
of good knives and forks ; in another I found about thirty-six
pounds' value in money--some European coin, some Brazil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " Oh, drug i"
said I aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou art not worth
to me--no, not the takin off the ground ; one of those knives
is worth all this heap ; I gave no manner of use for thee ; e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as acreature whose
life is not worth saving." However, upon second thou hts,
I took it away ; and wrapping all in a piece of canvas, be-
gan to think of making another raft ; but while I was prepar-
ing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise,
and in a quaiter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore.
It resent] occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to
ma e a ra t with the wind offshore ; and that it was my busi-
ness to be gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I
might not be able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly, I
let myself down into the water, and swam across the channel
which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with
difiiculty enough, part] with the weight of the things I had
about me, and partly f'i'om the roughness of the water; for
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water
it blew a. storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay, with
all my wealth about me very secure. It blew ver hard all
that ni ht, and in the mornin , when I looked out, ehold, no
more ship was to be seen. was a little surprised, but re-
covered myself with this satisfactory reflection, that I had lost
no time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of her
that could be useful to me ; and that, indeed, there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any-
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her
wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did; but
those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securin
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wil
beasts, if any were in the island; and I had man thoughts
of the method how to do this, and what kind of welling to
make--whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a
tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both ; the
manner and description of which it may not be improper to
give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settle-
ment, articularly because it was u on a low moorish ground
near t e sea, and I believed woul not be wholesome, and
more particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so
I resolived to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of

roun .

g I consulted several thin in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me: .hrst, health and fresh water, I just
now mentioned ; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun ;
thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether man or
beast ; fourthly, aview to the sea, that if God sent any ship in
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of
w rich I was not willing to banish my ex ectation yet.

In search of a place pro er for this, I ound a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, w ose front towards this little plain
was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down
upon me from the top. On the side of the rock there was a
hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of
a cave ; but there was not really any cave, or way into the
rock, at all.

On the flat of the green, just below this hollow place, 1 re-
solved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green be-
fore my door; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly
every way down into the low ground by _the seaside. It was46 nosmsox 0305012.

on the N.N.VV. side of the bill; so that it was sheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to the W. and by S. sun, or
thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hol-
low place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter,
from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its be-
ginning and ending.

In this half-circle I 'pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
them into the groun till they stood very firm like piles, the
biggest end being out of the round above five feet and a half,
and sharpened on the to . he two rows did not stand above
six inches from one anot er.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship,
and laid them in rows, upon one another, within the circle, be-
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and
a half high, like a spur to a post ; and this fence was so strong
that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it. This
cost me a great deal of time and labor, especially to cut the

iles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them
Into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door,
but by a short ladder to go over the to ; which ladder, when
I was in, I lifted over after me; an so I was completely
fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done ; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was
no need of all this caution from the enemies that I appre-
hended danger from.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which
you have the account above ; and I made me a large tent also,
to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the ear are
very violent there. I made it double--viz., one sma ler tent
within, and one larger tent above it ; and covered the upper-
most part of it with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among
the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a
very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my rovisions, and everythin
that would spoil by the wet; and) having thus inelosed al
my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left
ppgg, and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short
a er.
When I had done this, I began to work In way into the
rock, and bringinglall the earth and stones that dug down, out
through my tent, laid them up within my fence, in the nature
of a terrace, so that it raised t e ground within about a foot
and a half ; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent,
which served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labor and many days before all these
things were brou ht to perfection; and therefore I must go
back to some ot er things which took up some of my
thoughts. At the same time it occurred, after I had laid my
scheme for the setting up the tent, and making the cave, that
a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden
flash of lightning happened, and after that, a great clap of
thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much
surprised with the lightning, as I was with the thought
which darted into my mind as swift asthe lightning itself.
" Oh, my powder I" My very heart sank within me, when I
thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed ;
on which not my defense only, but the providing me food, as
I thought, entiretlly depended. I was nothing near so anxious
about my own anger; though, had the powder took fire, I
had never known who had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me that, after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my work, my building and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes to
separate my powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a
parcel, in hopes, that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should not
be ossible to make one part fire another. I finished this
wor in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in
all was about one hundred and forty ounds' weight, was
divided into no less than a hundred parce s. As to the barrel
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from
that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I
called m kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes
among t )e rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking
very carefully where I had laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at
least once every da with my gun, as well to divert myself, as
to see if I could kill anything fit for food; and, as near as I
could, to acquaint myself with what the island roduced.
The first time I went out, I presently discovered tlat there
were goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to
me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to me,
viz., that they Were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot,
that it was the most difiicult thing in the world to come at
them; but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened ; for after
I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner
for them: I observed if they saw me in the valleys, though
they were upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a
terrible friglht ; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I
was upon t e rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence
I concluded that, by the position of their optics, their sight
was so directed downward that they did not readily see
objects that were above them; so afterwards I took this
method--I always climbed the rocks first, to get above them,
and then had frequently a fair mark.

The first shot I made among these creatures I killed a she-
goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to,
which grieved me heartily; for, when the old one fell, the
kid stood stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; and
not only so, but when I carried the old one with me upon my
shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my inclosure; upon
which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms,
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up
tame ; but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it and eat
it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great while,
for I eat sparingly, an saved my provisions, my bread
es ecially, as much as I possibly could.

aving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to
burn; and wrat I did for that, as also how I enlarged my
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full ac-
count of in its place; but I must now give some little ac-
count of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it
ma well be supposed, were not a few.

had a dismal prospect of my condition, for as I was not
cast awa upon that island without being driven, as is said,
by a vio ent storm quite out of the course of our intended
voyage, and a great wa , viz., some hundreds of leagues, out of
the ordinary course of t ie trade of mankind, I had reat reason
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, t rat in this
desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end In
life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when
made these reflections: and sometimes I would expostulate
with myself why Providence should thus completely ruin its
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so without
help abandoned, and so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check these
thoughts, and to reprove me ; and particularly one day walk-
ing with my gun in my hand by the seaside, I was very pen-
sive upon the subject of my present condition, when Reason,
as it were, put in expostulating with me the other way, thus:
" Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true ; but, pray
remember, where are the rest of ou? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat ? here are the ten ? Why
were not they saved, and you lost? Why are you singled out ?
Is it better to be here or there?" And then I pointed to
the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is
in them and with what worse attended them. '

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had
not happened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the
ship floated from the lace .where first she struck, and was
driven so near to the s ore, that I had time to get all these
things out of her? What would have been my case, if I had
been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at first
came on shore, without necessaries of life, or any means to
supply and procure them? " Particularly," said I aloud
(though to myself), " what should I have done without a gun,
without ammunition, without an tools to make anything, or
to work with ? without clothes, edding, a tent, or any man-
ner of coverings? " and that now I had all these to a sufficient
quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a
manner as to live without my un, when my ammunition was
spent: so that I had a tolerab e view of subsisting without
any want as long as I lived; for I considered from the begin-
ning how I woul provide for the accidents that might happen,
and for the time that was to come, even not onl after my
ammunition should be spent, but even after my ealth and
strength should decay.

I confess I had not then entertained ariy notion of my am-
munition being destroyed at one blast-- mean, my powder
being blown up by lightning ; and this made the thought of
it surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I
observed just now.

And now, being about to enter into a melanchol relation of
a scene of silent life, such, erha s, as was never card of in
the world before, I shall tagse it rom its beginning, and con-
tinue it in its order. V It was, by my account, the 80th of Sep-
tember, when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot
upon this horrid island ; when the sun being to us in its autum-
nal equinox, was almost just over my head: for I reckoned
myself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees
twenty-two minutes north of the line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for
want of books, and en, and ink, and should even forget the
Sabbath-day from t 1e workin -days ; but to prevent this,
I cut it with my knife upon a arge post, in capital letters ;
and making it into a reat cross, I set it up on the shore where
I first landed, viz., " came on shore here on the 30th of Sep-
tember, 1659."

Upon the sides of this square post I out every day a notch
with my knife, and eve sevent notch was as long again as
the rest, and every first ay of the month as long again as that
long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly,
and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next lace, we are to observe that, among the many
thin s which brought from the ship in the several vo ages
whic , as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several t ings
of less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted
setting down before ; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper;
severa parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's
keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical instru:
ments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation;
all which I huddled together, whether I might want them
or no; also I found three very good Bibles, which came to me
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among
my thin s; some Portuguese books also; and, among them,
two or t ree Po ish prayer-books, and several other books;
all which I care ully secured. And I must not forget that
we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent
history I must have occasion to say something in its place, for
I carried both the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he
jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a
trusty servant to me many years; Iwanted nothing that he
could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to
me ; I on] wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could
not do. s I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper,
and I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show that
while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but after that
was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink by any
means that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these,
ink was one : as also a spade, pick-ax, and shovel, to dig orROBINSON 0317803. 5 1

remove the earth ; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I
soon learned to want that without much difiiculty.

This want of tools made every work Idid go on heavily;
and it was near a whole year before I had entirelljy finished my
little pale, or surrounded habitation. The p' es or stakes,
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in
briu ing home ; so that I s ent sometimes two days in cutting
and firinging home one 0 those posts, and a third day in
driving it into the ground ; for which purpose I got a heavy
piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myse f of one of
the iron crows; which, however, though found it, yet made
driving those osts or piles very laborious and tedious work.
But what need) I have been concerned at the tediousness of
anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in?
nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at
least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to
seek for food, which I did, more or less, every day.

I now began to consider seriousl m condition, and the
circumstances I was reduced to ; an I rew up the state of
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that
were to come after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
afflicting my mind: and as my reason he an now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myse f as well as I could,
and to set the good against the evil, that I mi ht have some-
thing to distinguish my case from worse, and stated it very
impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comfort I enjoyed,
against the miseries I sufiered, thus :

EVIL.

I am cast upon a horrible, desolate
island; void of all hope of recovery.

I am singled out and se arated. as it
were. from all the world, to a miserable.

I am divided (rom mankind a solitary ;
one banished from human society.

I have no clothes to cover me.

I am without any defense, or means to
resist any violence of man or beast.

Ihave no soul to speekio or relieve me.

Upon the whole, here was

GOOD.

But I am alive; and not drowned. as
all my ship's company was.

But I am singled out. too. from all the
ship's crew, to be spared from death;
an He that miraculously saved me from
death can deliver me from this condition.

But I am not starved and perishiug on
a barren place, adordin uo sustenance.

But I am in a hot c Imate, where if I
had clothes, I could hardly wear them.

But I am cast on an island where I see
no wild beasts to hurt me. as I saw on the
coast of Africa; and what if I had been
shi wrecked there i

at God wonderfully sent the ship in
near enough to the shore, that I have got
out so many I: things as will
either suppl my wants or enable me a:
supply myse l', even as long as I live.

an undoubted testimony that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but
there was something negative, or something positive, to be
thankful for in it : and let this stand as a direction, from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this
world--that we may always find in it something to comfort
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and evil,
on the credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a_little to relish my con-
dition, and giving over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy
a ship; I say, giving over these things, I began to apply my-
self to accommodate my way of living, and to make things as
eas to me as I could. .

thave already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts
and cables ; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a
kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside: and after some time (I think it was a year and a
half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched
or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could
get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the
year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
this ale, and into the cave which I ad made behind me.
But must observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap
of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took u all
my place ; I had no room to turn myself : so I set myse f to
enlarge my cave, and worked farther into the earth; for it
was a loose, sandy rock, which ryielded easily to the labor I
bestowed on it: and so when found I was pretty safe as
to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand, into
the rock ; and then turning to the right again, worked uite
out, and made me a door to come out on the outside 0 my
pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and re ress, as it was a. back
way to my tent and to my storehouse, ut gave me room to
stow my goods. '

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table ; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few com-
forts I had in the world; I could not write, or eat, or do
several things with so much pleasure without a table.

So I went to work ; and here I must needs observe that as
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by
stating and squaring everything by reason, and by making
the most rational judgment of things, every man may be, in
time, master of ever mechanic art. I had never handled
a tool in my life; an yet in time my labor, application, and
contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made
abundance of things, even without tools; and some with no
more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labor.
For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to
cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat
on either side with my axe till I had brought it to be as thin
as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true,
by this method I could make but one board out of a whole
tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more
than I had for the prodigious deal of time and labor which it
took me up to make a plank or board ; but my time and labor
was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as
another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place ; and this I did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship. But when
I had wrought out some boards as above, I made large shelves,
of the breadth of a foot and an half, one over another, all
along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-
work on ; and, in a word, to separate everything at large into
their places, that I might come easily at them ; also I knocked
pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang my guns and all
things that would hang up: so that had my cave been to be
seen, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary things ;
and I had everything so ready at my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and especially
to find my stock of all necessaries so great.

And now it was when I began to keep a journal of ever
day's em loyment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too muc
hurry, and not onl an hurry as to labor, but in too much dis-
composure of min ; and my journal would have been full of
many dull things ; for example, I must have said thus :

"September 30.--After I had got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliver-
ance, having first vomited, with the reat quanity of salt
water which was gotten into m stomac , and recovering my-
self a little, I ran about the s ore wringing my hands and
beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and
cryin out was undone, undone! till, tired and faint, I was
force to lie down on the ground for repose, but durst not
sleep, for fear of being devoured."
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet I could not for-
bear getting 11 to the top of a little mountain, and looking
out to sea, in opes of seeing a ship : then fancy at a vast
distance I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and
then, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it
quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began, I say, to keep my journal ; of which I shall here give
you the co y (though in it will be told all these particulars
over againi', as long as it lasted ; for at last, having no more
ink, I was forced to leave it off.

THE JOURNAL.

September 30, 1659.--I, poor. miserable Robinson Crusoe,
being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the ofiin ,
came on shore on this drama], unfortunate island, which
called "The Island of Despair" ; all the rest of the ship's
com any being drowned, and myself almost dead.

lthe rest of the day I spent in afflicting m self at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to; viz., I ad neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to ; and in despair
of any relief, saw nothing but death before me ; either that I
should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or
starved to death for want of food. At the approach of ni ht
I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soun y,
though it rained all night.

October l.--In the morning I saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on
shore again, much nearer the island; which, as it was some
comfort, on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, and not
broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on
board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my
relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss
of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least, that they would
not have been all drowned, as they were ; and that, had the
men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of
the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other part
of the world. I spent great part of this day in erplexing
myself on these things ; but, at length, seeing the ship almost
dry, I went uplpn the sand as near as I could, and then swam
on board. T 's day also it continued raining, though with
no wind at all.

Mom the lat of October to the EMA--All these days en.
tirely spent in many several voyages to get all I could out of
the shi , which I brought on shore, every tide 0f flood, upon
rafts. uoh rain also, in those days, though with some in-
tervals of fair weather; but it seems this was the rainy
season.

October 24.---I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got
upon it ; but being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was
out.

October 25.--It rained all night and all day, with some
gusts of wind; during which time,the ship broke in pieces,
the wind blowing a little harder than before, and was no
more to be seen, exce t the wreck of her, and that only at low
water. I spent this ay in covering and securing the goods
which I saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

October 26.--I walked about the shore almost all day, to
find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to
secure myself from any attack in the night, either from wild
beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place,
under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment,
which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifica-
tion, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and with-
out with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked ve hard in can 'ng
all my goods to my new habitation, thoug some part 0 the
time it rained exceeding hard.

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to seek for some food, and discover the country;
w en I killed a she- oat, and her kid followed me home,
which I afterwards kil ed also, because it would not feed.

November l.--I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there
for the first night ; making it as large as I could, with stakes
driven in to swin my hammock upon.

1Vovember 2.-- set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed
a fence round me, a little within the place I had marked out
for my fortification. '

November 3.--I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the after-
noon went to work to make me a table.

November 4.--This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of
diversion ; viz.,every morning I walked out with my gun for
two or three hours, if it did not rain; then emplo ed myself
to work till about eleven o'clock; then ate what I ad to live
on ; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive hot : and then, in the evening, to work again.
The working part of this day and the next Were wholly
employed in making this table, for I was yet but a very sorry
workman, though time and necessit made me a complete
natural mechanic soon after, as I be ieve they would do any
one else.

Nbvember 5.--This da I went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a w' dcat; her skin pretty soft, but her
flesh good for nothing ; every creature I killed, I took off the
skins and preserved them., Comin back by the seashore, I
saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which did not understand ; but
was surprised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they
were, got into the sea and escaped me for that time.

1Vovember 6.--After my morning walk, I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking;
nor was it long before I learned to mend it.

November 7.---Now it be an to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, an part of the 12th (for the 11th
was Sunday according to my reckoning), I took wholly up to
make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable
shape, but never to please me; and even in the making I
pulled it to pieces several times.

Note--I soon neglected keeping Sundays; for, omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.

November 13.~----This day it rained, which refreshed me ex--
ceedingly, and cooled the earth : but it was accompanied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully,
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger.

November 14, 15, l6.---These three days I spent in making
little square chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound,
or two pounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder
in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another
as possible. On one of these three days I killed a large bird
that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.

November l7.---This day I began to dig behind my tent into
the rock, to make room for my further convenieucy.

Nam--Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work; viz.,
a pickax, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I desistcd
from my work, and bega to consider how to supply that want,
and make me some too 3. As for the pickax, I made use of the
iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy; but the
next thing was a shove , or spade; this was so absolutely nec-
essary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it;
but what kind of one to make I knew not.

November 18.--The next day, in searching the woods, I found
a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call
the iron tree, for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great
labor, and almost spoiling my ax, I cut a piece, and brought it
home, with difficulty enough, for it was exceedin heavy. The
excessive hardness of the wood, and having on otier way, made
me a long while upon this machine, for I worked it efiectually
by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade; the
handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the board
part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last
me so long; however, it served well enough for the uses which
I had occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe,
made after that fashion, or so lon making.

I was still deficient, for I wante a basket, or a wheelbarrow.
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such
things as twigs that would bend to-make wicker-ware--at least,
none yet found out; and as to the wheelbarrow, I fancied I
could make all but the wheel; but that I had no notion of;
neither did I know how to go about it ; besides, I had no possi-
ble way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the
wheel to run in ; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away
the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like
a hod, which the laborers carry mortar in, when they serve the
bricklayers. This was not so dificult to me as the makin the
shovel ; and yet this and the shovel, and the attempt Which I
made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than
four days, I mean always exceptin my morning's walk with
my gun, which I seldom failed, an very seldom failed also of
brilr'ilging home something fit to eat.

ovember 28.--My other work having stood still, because of
my making these tools, when they were finished I went on.
and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I
spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.

Note--During all this time I worked to make this room, or
cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for a
lodging, I kept to the tent; except that sometimes, in the wet
season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep my.
self dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles, in the form of- rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of
trees, like a thatch.

December 10.--I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large)
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one si e
so much that, in short,it frighted me, and not without reason,
too; for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-
digger. Upon this disasterI had a great deal of work to do
over again,for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which
was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I
mi ht be sure no more would come down.

ecember 11.--This day I went to work with it accordingly,
and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with
two pieces of board across over each post; this I finished the
next day, and setting more posts up with boards, in about a
week more I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in
rows, served me for partitions to part elf my house.

December 17.--From this day to the 20th I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the osts, to hang everything up that
could be hung up ; and now began to be in some order within
doors.

December 20.--Now I carried everything into the cave, and
began to furnish my house, and set up some ieces of board like
a dresser, to order my victuals upon ; but oard began to be
ver scarce with me; also I made me another table.

ecember 24.--Much rain all night and all day; no stirring
out.

December 25.--Rain all day.

December 26.--No rain, and the earth much cooler than be-
fore, and pleasanter.

December 27.--Killed a young goat, and lamed another so
that I catehed it, and led it home in a string ; when I had it
at home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.

1V. B.--I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew
well and as strong as ever; but by nursing itso long it grew
tame and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not go
away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought of
breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot were all spent.

December 28, 29, 30, 31.--Great heats and no breeze, so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food ;
this timeI spent in putting all my things in order within doors.
January 1,--Very hot still : but I went abroad early and late
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the
center of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceedingly shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to
try if I could not bring m dog tohunt them down.

January 2.--Accor ing y, the next day I went outwith my
dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for the
all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too we] ,
for he would not come near them.

January 3.---I began my fence, or wall ; which, being still
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make
veg thick and strong.

. B.--This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the Journal ; it is sufficient to observe thatI
was no less time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it
was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a
half-circle, from one place in the rock to another place, about
ei ht ards from it, the door of the cave being in the center
be iin it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many
days, nay, sometimes weeks together ; but I thought I should
never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; and it is
scarce credible what inexpressible labor everything was done
with, especially the brin ing piles out of the woods, and driv-
ing them into the groun ; forI made them much bigger than
I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside doubled-fenced
with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that,
if any people were to come on shore there, they would not per-
ceive any thing like a habitation ; and it was very well I did
so, .as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable oc-
casron.

During this time I made rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent
discoveries in these walks of something or other to my ad-
vantage ; particularly I founda kind of wild pigeons, wluch
build, not as woodpigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the holes of rocks ; and taking some young ones, I endeavored
to breed them up tame, and did so ; but when they grew older
they flew all' away, which perhaps was at first for want of feed-
ing them, for I had nothing to give them ; however, I fre-
quently found their nests, and got their young ones, which
were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it
was impossible for me to make ; as, indeed, as to some of them
it was : for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.
I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one of them, though I
spent many weeks about it ; I could neither put in the heads,
nor join the staves so true to one another as to make them
hold water ; so I gave that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles ; so that
as soon as it was dark, which was generall by seven o'clock,
I was obliged to go to bed. I remember-e the him of bees-
wax with which I made candles in my African a venture ;
but I had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me
light, though not a clear, steady light like a candle. In the mid-
dle of all my labors it happened that, rummaging my things, I
found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled
with corn for the feeding of poultry--not for this voyage, but
before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. What
little remainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured
by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust;
and being willing to have the bag for some other use (I think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning,
or some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of it on one
side of my fortification, under the rock.

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned
that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of anything, and
not so much as remembering that I had thrown anything there,
when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few
stalks of something green shooting upon the ground, which I
fancied might be some plant I had not seen ; but I was sur-
prised, and perfectly astonished when, after a little longer
time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European--nay,
as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of my thoughts on this occasion ; I had hitherto acted upon
no religious foundation at all ; indeed,I had very few notions
of religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any-
thing that had befallen me, otherwise than a chance, or, as we
lightly say, what leases God, without so much as inquiring
into the end of rovidence in these things, or his order in
governing events in the world. But after I saw barley grow
there in aclimate which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me
strangel , and I began to suggest that God had miraculously
caused t is grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and
that it was so directed purely for my sustenance in that wild,
miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of Nature
should happen 11 on my account ; and this was the more strange
to me, because saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks
of rice, and which I knew because I had seen it grow in Africa,
when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but not doubting but that there was more in
the place, went all over that part of the island where I had
been before, peering in every corner and under every rock, to
see for more of it, but I could not find any. At last it occurred
to my thoughts that I had shaken the bag of chickens' meat
out in that place ; and the wonder began to cease ; and I must
confess, my religious thankfulness to God's providence began
to abate too, upon the discovering. that all this was nothing
but what was common ; though I ought to have been as thank-
ful for so strange and unforeseen providence, as if it had been
miraculous ; for it was really the work of Providence as to me,
that should order or ap oint that ten or twelve grains of corn
should remain unspoile , when the rats had destroyed all the
rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also that I
should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in
the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately ; whereas,
if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time it had been
burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, on may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of une ; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time,
to have some quantity, sufiicient to supply me with bread.
But it was not till the fourth year that would allow myself
the least rain of this corn to eat, and even then but spar-
ingly, as? shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost all
that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time ;
for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came
up at all, at least not as it would have done ; of which in its
p ace.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz.,
to make me bread, or rather food ; for I found ways to cook
it up without baking, though I did that also after some time.

But to return to my Journal:

I worked excessive hard these three or four months, to get
my wall done ; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, contriv-
ing to go into it, not by a door, but over a wall, b a ladder,
that there mi ht be no sign on the outside of my abitation.

April 16.-- finished the ladder ; so I went up the ladder to
the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on the
inside : this was a complete inclosure to me; for within I
had room enough,'and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost
had all my labors overthrown at once, and myself killed.
The case was thus: As I was busy in the inside of it, behind
my tent, Just in the entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightene with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed ; for,
all on a sudden, I found the earth came tumbling down from
the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my
head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked
in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared; but thought
nothing of what really was the cause, only thinking that the
top of my cave was fallen in, as some of it had done before ;
and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forwards to my
ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over
my wall for fear of the pieces of the bill, which I expected
might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped down
upon the firm ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible
earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three times at
about eight minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would
have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed
to have stood upon the earth ; and a great piece of the top of
the rock, which stood about half a mile from me, next the sea,
fell down with such aterrible noise as I never heard in all my
life. I p'erceived also the very sea was put into a violent
motion y it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the
like, or discoursed with an one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupefied ; and t no motion of the earth made my
stomach sick like one that was tossed at sea ; but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me
from the stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror,
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent
and all my household goods, and burying all at once; and
this sunk my very soul within me a second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage ; and yet I had not heart
enough to get over my wall again, for fear of being buried
alive, but still eat upon the ground, greatly cast down and
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I had
not the least serious religious thought ; nothing but the com-
mon " Lord, have mercy upon me l" and when it was over,
that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it grew
cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that, the wind arose
by little and little, so that in lesslthan half an hour it blew a
most dreadful hurricane of wind ; the sea was, all on a sud-
den, covered with foam and froth; the shore was covered
with the breach of the water ; the trees were torn up by the
roots; and a terrible storm it was. This held about three
hours and then began to abate ; and then in two hours more
it was calm, and began to rain very hard. All this while I
sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected ; when
on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and
rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave
again. With this thought, m spirits began to revive; and
the rain also helpin to persua e me, I went in and sat down
in my tent; but t e rain was so violent that my tent was
ready to be beaten down with it ; and I was forced to o in-
to my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for ear it
should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a
new work, viz., to cut a hole through my new fortifications,
like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave some time,
and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I
began to be more com osed. And now to support my spirits,
which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small sup of rum ; which, however, I did then and
always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when
that was gone. It continued raining all that night, and great
part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but my
mind being more composed, I began to think of what I had
best to do ; concluding, that if the island was subject to
these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave,
but I must consider of building me some little but in an open
place which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here,
and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men; for 1
concluded if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one
time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to move my tent from the
place where it now stood, which was just under the hanging
preci ice of the hill ; and which, if it should be shaken again,
woul certainly fall upon my tent ; and I spent the two next
days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where
and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being swal-
lowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet ; and yet
the apprehensions of lying abroad without any fence were
almost equal to it: but still, when I looked about, and saw
how ever thing was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I
was, and row safe from danger, it made me loath to remove. In
the mean time, it occurred to me that it would require a vast
deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to
run the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for my-
self, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this
resolutionI composed myself for a time, and resolved that I
would 0 to work with all speed to build me awall with piles
and cabdes,etc., in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it,
when it was finished ; but that I would venture to stay where
I was till it was finished, and fit to remove to. This was the
21st.

April 22.--The next morning I began to consider of means
to put this resolve in execution; but I was at a great loss
about my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of
hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the
Indians) ; but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
wood, they were all full of notches, and dull ; and though I
had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.
This caused me as much thought as a statesman would have
bestowed upon a grand point of politics, orjudge upon the life
and death of a man. At length, I contrived a wheel with a
string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands
at ibert .

NotalI had not seen any such thing in England, or at least
not to take notice how it was done, though I have observed
it was very common there ; besides that, my grindstone was
very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week's
work to bring it to perfection.

April 28, 29.--These two whole days I took up in grinding my
toollls, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very
we .

April 80,--Having perceived my bread had been low a great
while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one
biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart ve'ry heavy.

May 1.--In the morning, looking towards the seaside, the
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a cask ; when I came to it, Ifound
a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the
ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and look-
ing towards the wreck itself,Ithought it seemed to lie hi her
out of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel w rich
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gun-
powder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked
as hard as a stone : however, I rolled it farther on shore for the
present, and went on upon the sand, as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship, to look for more.

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely re-
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand,
was heaved up at least six feet, and the stern, which was
broken to pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the
sea soon after I had left rummaging of her, was tossed, as it
were, up, and cast on one side ; and the sand was thrown so
high on that side next the stern, that whereas there was a great
place of water before, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the
earthquake ; and as by this violence the ship was more broken
open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore,
which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water
rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of remov-
ing my habitation and I busied myself mi htily, that day espe-
cially, in searching whether I could ma 'e any way into the
ship ; but I found nothin was to be expected of that kind, for
that all the inside of the s ip was choked up with sand. How-
ever, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to
pull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding
that everything I could get from her would be of some use or
other to me.

May 3.~--I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam
through, which held some of the upper part or quarterdeck
together, and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the
sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest ; but
the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time.

flfay 4.--I went a-lishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going
to leave olf, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a
long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no books; yet I fre-
quently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all
which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.

.May 5.--Worked on the wreck ; cut another beam asunder,
and brought three great fire planks 03 from the decks, which
I tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide of
flood came on.

May 6.--W'orkcd on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron-work ; worked very hard, and
came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it
over.

May 7.--Went to the wreck again, with an intent not to
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broken itself
down, the beams being cut; that several ieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the ho d lay so open that
I could see into it ; but it was almost full of water and sand.

May 8.--Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
or sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck
for next day. _

May 9.----Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt also
a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to
move.

May 10, 11, 12, 18, 14.-----VVent every day to the wreck;
and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or planks,
and two or three hundredweight of iron.

May 15.--I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a
piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other ; but as it lay about a foot and
a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.

May 16.--It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed
so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide
prevented me going to the wreck that day.

May 17.--I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore,
at a great distance, near two miles 01f me, but resolved to see
what they were, and found they were pieces of the head, but
too heavy for me to bring away.

May 24.--Every day, to this day, I worked "on the wreck;
and with hard labor I loosened some things so much with the
crow that the first flowing tide several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests ; but the wind blowing from the
shore nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and
a hogshead which had some Brazil ork in it ; but the
salt water and the sand had spoiled it. continued this work
every day to the 15th of June, exce t the time necessar to
get food, which I always appointed? during this art 0 my
employment, to be when the tide was up, that might be
ready when it was ebbed out ; and by this time I had gotten
timber, and lank, and iron-work>> enounrh to have built a good
boat, if I ha known how; and also I ot, at several times,
and in several pieces, near one hundre weight of the sheet
lead. ~

June 16.--Going down to the seaside, I found a large tor-
toise, or turtle. This was the firstI had seen, which, it seems,
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place or the
scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other side of the
island,I might have had hundreds of them every day, as I
ffiund afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for
t em.

June 17.--I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in herthree-
score eggs ; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most
savory and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had
no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrible

lace.
P June 18.--Rained all the day, and I stayed within. I
thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was something
chilly, which I knew was not usual in that latitude.

June ISL--Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had
been cold.

June 20.--No rest all night ; violent pains in my head, and
feverish.

June 21.--Very ill ; frighted almost to death with the ap-
prehensions of my sad condition--to be sick, and no help :

rayed to God, for the first time since the storm ofi of Hull,
gut scarce knew what I said or why ; my thoughts being all
confused. '

June 22.--A little better ; but under dreadful apprehensions
of sickness.

June 23.--Very had again; cold and shivering, and then a
violent headache.

June 24,--Much better.

June 25.--An ague very violent : the fit held me seven
hours ; cold fit, and hot with faint sweats after it.

June 26.--Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak; however, I killed a she-
goat, and with much difliculty got it home, and broiled some
of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.

June 27.--'1'he ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day,
and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst ;
but so weak I had no strength to stand up, or to get myself
any water to drink. Frayed to God again, but was light-
headed ; and when I was not, I was so i norant that I knew
not what to say ; only I lay and cried, " 0rd, look upon me !
Lord, pity me ! Lord, have mercy upon me i" I suppose Idid
nothing else for two or three hours ; till the fit wearin of, I
fell aslee , and did not awake till far in the night. V hen I
awoke, found myself much refreshed, but weak, and ex-
ceeding thirsty; however, as I had no water in my whole
habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to slee
again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream :
thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of
my wall, whereI sat when the storm blew after the earth-
quake, and that I saw a man desend from a great black cloud,
in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground : he was
all over as bright as a flame, so that could but just bear to
look towards him: his countenance was most inexpressibly
dreadful, impossible for words to describe ; when he stepped
upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,
just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air
looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes
of fire. He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forwards towards me with a long spear or weapon in
his hand to kill me ; and when he came to a rising ground, at
some distance, he spoke to me--or I heard a voice so terrible
that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All that I can
say I understood was this :--" Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to re entance now thou shalt die ;"--at
which words, I thought e lifted up the spear that was in his
hand to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this ter-
rible vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even
dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible to de-
scribe the impression that remained upon my mind when I
awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had received
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by
an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wicked-
n. as, and a constant conversation with none but such as were,
like in self, wickedaud profane to the last (le ree. I do not
remember that I had, in all that time, one t ought that so
much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or
inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways: but a cer-
tain stupidity of soul without desire of good, or conscience
of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me 3 and I was all that the
most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our
common sailors can be sup used to be--not having the least
sense, either of the fear of 0d in dangers, or of thankfulness
to God in deliverances.

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will
be the more easily believed when I shall add, that through all
the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I
never had so much as once thought of its being the hand of
God, or that it was a just punishment for my sins--my re-
bellious behavior against m father--or my present sins,
which were great--or so muc as a punishment for the gen-
eral course of my wicked life. "Him I was on the desperate
expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had so much
as one thought of what would become of me, or one wish to
God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from
voracious creatures as cruel savages ; but I was merely
thoughtless of God or a Providence--I acted like a mere
brute, from the rinciples of nature, and by the dictates of
common sense on y, and indeed hardly that. When I was de-
livered and taken up at sea by the Portugal captain, well used,
and dealt justly and honorably with, as well as charitably, I
had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts. When, again,
I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on
this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a
judgment. I only said to myself often, that I was an unfort-
unate dog, and born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all m
ship's crew drawned, and myself spared, I was surprised, witi
a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, whlch, had the
grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thankful-
ness ; but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight of
iioy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the
east reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of the Hand
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be pre-
served when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why
Providence had been thus merciful to me. Even just the
same common sort of joy which seamen generally have, after
they have ot safe ashore from a shipwreck, all which they
drown in t e next bowl of punch and forget almost as soon
as it is over: and all the rest of my life was like it. Even
when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible
of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of
the reach of human kind, out of all ho e of relief, or prospect
of redemption, as soon as I saw a proba ility of living, and that
I should not starve and erish for hunger, all the sense of my
aflliction were off ; and I began to be very easy; applied my-
self to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and
was far enouoh from being afflicted at my condition, as a judg-
ment from lfeaven, or as the hand of God against me: these
were thoughts which very seldom entered into my head.

The growin up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had
at first some {little influence upon me, and began to affect
me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something
miraculous in it ; but as soon as ever that part of the thought
was removed, all the impression which was raised from it
wore 03 also, as I have noted already. Even the earthquake,
though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more
immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone di-
rects such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but
the impression it had made went of also. I had no more
sense of God or his judgment--much less of the present
affliction of my circumstances being from his hand--than if I
had been in the most prosperous condition of life. But now,
when I began to be Sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries
of death came to place itself before me ; when my spirits be-
gan to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and na-
ture was exhausted with the violence of the fever, con-
science, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began
to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had so
evidentl , by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of
God to ay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me
in so vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed me
from the second or third day of m distemper; and in the
violence, as well of the fever as of t e dreadful reproaches of
my conscience, extorted some words from me like praying to
God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended
with desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of mere
fright and distress. My thoughts were confused, the con-
victions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such
a miserable condition raised vapors into my head with the
mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul,I knew
not what my tongue might express. But it was rather excla-
mation, such as, "Lord, what a miserable creature am I l If I
should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and what
will become of me?" Then, the tears burst out of my eyes,
and I could say no more for a good while. In this interval, the
good advice of my father came to my mind, and presently his
prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story,
viz., that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist me
in my recovery. " Now," said I aloud, "my dear father's
words are come to ass; God's justice has overtaken me, and
I have none to be p or hear me. I rejected the voice of
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or sta-
tion of life wherein I might have been ha py and easy; but I
would neither see it in self, nor learn to know the blessin of
it from my parents. left them to mourn over my fo ly;
and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it. I re-
fused their help and assistance, who would have lifted me into
the world, and would have made everything easy to me; and
now I have difficulties to struggle with too great for even
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no com-
fort, no advice." lhen I cried out, "Lord, be my help, for I
am in great distress." This was the first prayer, if might
call it so, that I had made for many years. But I return
to my Journal.

June 28.---Having been somewhat refreshed with the slee
I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up ; and thoug
the fri ht and terror of my dream was very great, yet I'con-
sideref that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when I should be ill ; and the first thing I did,
I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it u on
my table, in reach of my bed; and to take oi the chil or
a uish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
ogrum into it, and mixed them together. Then I got me a iece
of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but coul eat
very little ; I walked about, but was very weak, and withal very
sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable condition,
dreading the return of my distemper the next da . At night,
I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, w ich I roasted
in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the shell, and this was the
first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, even as I
could remember, in my whole life.

After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak
that I could hardly carry the gun, for I never went out With-
out that ; so I went out but a little way, and sat down upon
the ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before
me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some thoughts
such as these occurred to me: What is the earth and sea, of
which I have seen so much? Whence is it produced? And
what am I, and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal? Whence are we ? Sure we are all made by some
secret Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky.
And who is that? Then it followed most naturally, It is God
that has made it all. Well, but then, it came on strongl , if
God has made all these things, he guides and governs, tiem
all, and all things that concern them ; for the Bein that
could make all things must certainly have power to gui e and
direct them. If so,nothing can happen in the great circuit of
his works, either without his knowledge or appointment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition ; and if noth-
ing happens without his appointment, he has appointed all this
to befall me. Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested upon me with
the greater force, that it must needs be that God had appointed
all this to befall me; that I was brought to this miserable cir-
cumstance by his direction, he having the sole power, not of
me only, but of ever thing that happened in the world. Im-
mediately it followe , Why has Go done this to me ? What
have I done to be thus used ? My conscience presently checked
me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed, and methou ht
it spoke to me like a voice, "VVretch l dost thou ask w rat
thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life,
and ask thyself, what thou hast not done? Ask, why is it
that thou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not
drowned in Yarmouth Roads ? killed in the fight, when the
ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war? devoured by the
wild beasts 06 the coast of Africa 'P or drowned here, when all
the crew erished but thyself ? Dost t/wu ask, What have I
done ? " was struck dumb with these reflections, as one aston-
ished, and had not a word to sa ,--no, not to answer to my-
self,----but rose up pensive and sa , walked back to my retreat,
and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed;
but my thou lits were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination]
to sleep : so sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for
it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehensionsof the return of
my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought,
that the Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost
all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of
the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was
green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body. Iopened the chest,
and found what I looked for, viz., the tobacco ; and as the
few books I had saved la there too, I took out one of the
Bibles which I mentioned efore, and which to this time I had
not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into. I
say I took it. out, and brought both that and the tobacco with
me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not,
as to my distemper, or whether it was cod for it or no ; but
I tried several experiments with it, as if was resolved it should
heal one way or other. I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed
it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first, almost stupefied my
brain, the tobacco beingrgreen and strong, and that I had not
been much used to it. hen I took some and steeped it an hour
or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay
down ; and, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held
my nose close over the smoke of it as lon as I could bear it, as
well for the heat as the virtue of it, an I held it almost to
suffocation. In the interval of this operation,I took up the
Bible and began to read ; but my head was too much disturbed
with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time ; only,
having opened the book casually, the words first that occurred
to me were these, " Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These words
were very apt to my case, and made some impression upon my
thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as
they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered, the word had
no sound, as I may say, to me, the thing was so remote, so im-
possible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as
the children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to
eat, "Can God s read a table in the wilderness?" so I began
to say, "Can God himself deliver me from this place?" And
as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, this
prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the
words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon
them very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I
said, dozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep : so I left
my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in
the night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I did
what I never had done in all my life ; I kneeled down, and
prayed to God to fulfill the promise to me, that if I called upon
iim in the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After m

broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in whic
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the
tobacco, that indeed I could scarcely get it down ; immediately
upon this I went to bed; and I found presently it flew up into
my head violently ; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no
more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock
in the afternoon the next day: nay, to this hour I am partly
of opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and til
almost three the day after; for otherwxse, I know not how I
should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as
it appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it
by crossing and re-crossing the line, I should have lost more
than one day ; but in m account it was lost, and I never knew
which way. Be that, owever, one way or other, when I
awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my 3 irits
livel and cheerful ; when I got up I was stronger than {was
the ay before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry ; and,
in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better. This was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad
with m gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a
sea-fow or two, something like a brand goose, and brought
them home ; but was not very forward to eat them; so I eat
some more of the' turtle's eggs, which were ver good. This
evening I renewed the medicine, which I ha supposed did
me good the day before, viz., the tobacco steeped in rum;
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of
the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke ; however, I was not
so well the next day, which was the let of July, as I ho ed I
should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, ut it
was not much.

July 2.--I renewed the medicine all three ways ; and dosed
(Iii-Well: with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I

an

July 3.--I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not
recover my full strength for some weeks after. \Vhile I was
thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon
this Scri ture, "I wi deliver thee ;" and the impossibility
of my de 'verance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it ; but as I was discouraging myself with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon
my eliverance from the main afiliction that I disregarded
the deliverance I had received, and I was, as it were, made to
ask m self such uestions as these, viz., Have I not been de-
livere , and won erfully too, from sickness? from the most
distressed condition that could be, and that was so frightful to
me? and what notice had I taken of it? Had I done my
part? God had delivered me, but I had not glorified him;
that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as
a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance?
This touched my heart very much ; and immediately I
kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery
from my sickness.

July 4.--In the morning I took the Bible ; and beginning
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and im-
posed upon myself to read a while every morning and every
night; not tying myself to the number of chapters, but as
long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after
I set seriously to this work, till I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.
The im ression of my dream revived; and the words, "All
these t ings have not brought thee to repentance," ran
seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God
to give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the
ver day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words :
" e is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and
to give remission." I threw down the book; and with my
heart as well as my hands lifted u to heaven, in a kind of
ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, '.' esus, thou Son of David !
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour ! give me repentance ! "
This was the first time I could say, in the true sense of the
words, that I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with a
sense of my condition, and with a true Scri ture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the ord of God; and
from this time,I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
"Call on me, and I will deliver thee, " in a difierent sense
from what I had ever done before 3 for then I had no notion
of anything being called deliverance, but my being delivered
from the captivity I was in: for though I was indeed at large
in the place, yet the island was certain] a prison to me, and
that in the worst sense in the world. ut now I learned to
take it in another sense : now I looked back upon my past life
with such horror, and m sins appeared so dreadfu , that my
soul sought nothing of 0d but deliverance from the load of
guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life,
it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be delivered
from it, or think of it ; it was all of no consideration, in com-
parison of this. And I added this part here, to hint to who-
ever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of
things, they will find deliverance from sin amueh greater
blessiu than deliverance Mom aflliction.

But, eaving this part, I return to my Journal :

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my
thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture
and praying to God, to thingsmf a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of ;
also, my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself to
furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my
wa of living as re ular as I could.

l'zrom the 4th of uly to the 14th, I was chiefly employed
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little
at a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a
fit of sickness ; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was,
and to what weakness I was reduced. The application which
I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never
cured an ague before ; neither can I recommend it to any one
to practice, by this experiment; and though it did carry of
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me'; for I had fre-
quent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time ; I
learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health
that could be, especially in those rains which came attended
with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which
came in a dry season was always most accompanied with such
storms, so I found this rain was much more dangerous than
the rain which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months;
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me ; and I firmly believed that no human
sha e had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured
my abitation, as I thought, fully to my mind,d had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to
see what other productions I might find, which yet I knew
nothing of.

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more partic-
ular surve of the island itself. I went up the creek first,
where, as hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found,
after I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow
any higher; and that it was no more than a little brook of
running water, and very fresh and good ; but this being the
dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it ; at
least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be per-
ceived. 0n the banks of this brook, I found many pleasant
savannas of meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass;
and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds,
where the water, as it might be supposed, never overflowed I
found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great
and very strong stalk ; there were divers other plants, which I
had no notion of or understanding about, and might, perhaps,
have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I
searched for the cassava root, which the Indians in all that
climate make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw
large lants of aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw
severa su ar-canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation im-
perfect. contented myself with these discoveries for this
time, and came back, musin with myself what course I might
take to know the virtue an goodness of any of the fruits of
plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no con.
clusion ; for, in short, I had made so little observation while
I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants of the
field ; at least, very little that might serve me to any purpose
now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and
after going something further than I had gone the day before,
I found the brook and savannas cease, and the 'country became
more woody than before. In this part I found different fruits,
and particularly I found melons upon the ground, in great
abundance; and grapes upon the trees ; the vines had spread
indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just
now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surpris-
ing discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was
warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remember-
in that, when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes
kil ed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by
throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent
use for these grapes ; and that was to cure or dry them in the
sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which
I thou ht would he, as indeed they were, as wholesome and as
agreea le to eat, when no grapes might be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habi-
tation, which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say,
I had lain from home. In the night, I took my first contrivance,
and got up into a tree, where I slept well ; and the next morn-
inrr proceeded upon my discovery, traveling nearly four_miles,
asaI might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due
north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the coun-
try seemed to descend to the west ; and a little spring of fresh
water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the
other way, that is, due east ; and the country appeared so fresh,
so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure,
or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden. I
descended a little on the side of that delicious valley, surveving
it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with other afilict-
ing thoughts, to think that this was all my own ; that I was king
and lord 'of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of pos-
session ; and, if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance
as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here
abundance of cocoa trees, orange. and lemon and citron trees ;
but all wild, and few bearing any fruit, at least not then. How-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to
eat, but very wholesome ; and I mixed their juice afterwards
with water, which made it very wholesome ; and very cool and
refreshing. I found now I had business enough to gather and
carry home ; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which
I knew was approaching. In order to do this, I gathered a great
heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place ; and taking
a few of each with me, I traveled homeward, and resolved to
come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make to
carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in
this journey, I came home so I must now call my tent and my
cave) ; but before I got tluther, the grapes were spoiled ; the
richness of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having broken
them and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing ;
as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was sur rised
when, coming to my leap of grapes, which were so I'lCI and
fine when I gathered them, I found them all spread abroad,
trodden to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there,
and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there
were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this;
but what they were I knew not. However, as I found there
was no layin them up on heaps, and no car ing them away in
a sack, but tiat one way they would be estroyed, and the
other way they would be crushed with their own wei ht, I took
another course ; for I gathered a large quantity of t no gra )es,
and hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that t Icy
might cure and dry in the sun ; and as for the limes and lemons,
I carried as man back as I could well stand under.

When I came ome from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure'the fruitfulness of that valley and the pleasant-
ness of the situation ; the security from storm on that side of
the water, and the wood ; and concluded that I had pitched
upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst art
0 the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider 0 re-
moving my habitation, and to look out for a place equally safe
as where now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruit-
ful art of the island.

is thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond
of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place temptin me;
but when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that was
now by the seaside, where it was at least ossible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage ; an that the same ill
fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same lace; and though it was scarce probable
that any such things ould ever happen, yet to inclose myself
among the hills and woods in the center of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, and to render such an afiair not only
impro able, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not b
any means to remove. However, I was so enamored wit
this place that I s ent much of my time there for the whole
remaining art of t 1e month of July ; and though, in on second
thoughts, resolved as above not to remove, yet I uilt me a
little kind of abower, and surrounded it at a distance with a
strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked, and filled between with brushwood; and here I
lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together, al-
ways going over it with a ladder as before ; so that I fancied
now I had my country house and my seacoast house; and this
work took me up to the beginning of Aumist.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my
labor, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first
habitation ; for though I had made me a tent like the other,
with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August, I found
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were
excellent good raisins of the sun ; so I began to take them
down from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for
the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I had
lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two
hundred large bunches at them. No sooner had I taken them
all down, and carried mostvof them home to my cave, but it
began to rain; and from hence, which was the 14th of August,
it rained, more or less, ever day till the middle of October,
and sometimes so violently t at I could not stir out of my cave
for several days.

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my
family; I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats,
who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and
I heard no more tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she
came home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because, though I had killed
a wildcat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a
quite difierent kind from our European cats; but the youna
cats were the same kind of house-breed as the old one ; an
both my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But
from these three cats I afterwards came to be so pestered with
cats that I was forced to kill them like vermin or wild
beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so
that I could not stir,and was now very careful not to be much
wet. In this confinement, I be an to be straitened for food;
but venturing out twice, I one ay killed a goat; and the last
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great mis-
fortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything), and two or
three of the turtle's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked
dail two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees
wor ed it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my
fence or wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed
myself before, I was in a perfect inclosure; whereas now, I
thought, I lay exposed, and yet I could not perceive that there
was any living t ring to fear; the biggest creature that I had
yet seen u on the island being a goat.

Septem er 30.--I was now come to the unhappy anniversary
of m landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found
I ha been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept
this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart for religious exercise,
prostratiug myself on the ground with the most serious

umiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his
righteous judgment upon me, and prayin to him to have
mercy on me through Jesus Christ ; and Ilaving not tasted
the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down
of the sun, I then ate abiscuit-cakc and abunch of grapes, and
went to bed, finishing the day as I began it. ' I had all this
time observed no Sabbath-day ; for as at first I had no sense of '
religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to
distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary
for the Sabbathday, and so did not really know what any of
the days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I
found I had been there a year : so Idivided it into weeks, and
set apart every seventh day foraSabbath ; though I found at
the end of my account I had lost a day or two in my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I contented
myself to use it more sparing] , and to write down only the
most remarkable events of my ife, without continuing a daily
memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to a pear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provi e for
them according] ; but I bought all my experience before I
had it, and this {am going to relate was one of the most dis-
couraging experiments that I made at all.

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley
and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I
thought, of themselves ; and believe there were about thirty
stalks of rice and about twenty of barley ; and now I thou ht
it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in is
southern'position, going from me. Accordingly, I du up a.
siece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spa e, and

ividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to .my thoughts that I would not
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper
time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leavmg
about a handful of each. It was a great comfort to me
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of that I sowed this
time came to anything ; for the dry months following, the
earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no
moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till the
wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been
newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which Ieasily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of
ground to make another trial in, andIdug up a piece of ground
near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in Feb-
ruary,a little before the vernal equinox ; and this having the
rainy months of March and April to water it, sprang 11p very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but having part of
the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had got, I had
but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amountingto
above half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment I was
made master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper
season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times and
two harvests every car. While this corn was growing I made
a little discovery, w rich was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to settle, which
was about the month of November, I made a visit up the coun-
try to my bower, where, though I had not been some months
I found all things just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge thatI had made was not only firm and entire, but the
stakes which' I had cut off of some trees that grew thereabouts
were all shot out and grown with long branches,as much asa
willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head.
I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow
as much alike as I could ; and it is scarcely credible how beauti-
ful a figure they grew into in three years ; so that though the
hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter,
yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it,
and it was a complete shade, suflicient to lodge under all the
dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more stakes
and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall
(I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did ; and placing
the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards distance
from my first fence, they grew present] , and were at first a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwar s served for a defense
also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found new that the seasons of the year might generally
be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into
the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally
thus :

The half of Februar , the whole of March, and the half of
A ril--rainy, the sun eing then on or near the equinox.

he half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and
fihe half of August--dry, the sun being then to the north of the
ne.

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half
of October--rainy, the sun being then come back.

The half of October, the whole of November, December,
and January, and the half of February--dry, the sun being
then to the south of the line.

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the
winds happened to blow, but this was the general observation
I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill conse-
quence of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish my-
self with prov1sions beforehand, that I might not be obliged
to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible durin
the wet months. In this time I found much employment, an
very suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion of
many thin s which I had no way to furnish myself with but
by hard la or and constant application ; articularly, I tried
many ways to make myself a asket, but a l the twigs I could
get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do noth-.
mg. It proved of excellent advantage to me now that, when I
was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing ata basket-
maker's, in the town where my father lived, to see them make
their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very ofli-
cious to help, and a great observer of the manner how the
worked those things, and sometimes lent a hand, I had by this
means so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind that
the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew
mi ht possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers
in ngland, and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day
I went to my country house, as called it, an cutting some of
the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire ; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a
hatchet to cut down a quantit , which I soon found, for there
was a great lenty of them. I'hese I set up to dry, within my
circle or he ges, and when they were fit for use, I carried
them to my cave; and here, during the next season, I em-
ployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many

askets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as
I had occasion; and though I did not finish them very hand-
somely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my pur-
pose; and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without
them; and as my wickerware decayed, I made more, es e-
cially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in,instead of sac s,
when I should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and emplo ed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possi le, how to sup-
ply two wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that was
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles--some of the common size, and others
which were case-bottles, square, for the holding of water,
spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything in,
exce t a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and
whic was too big for such uses as I desired it for--viz, to
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second
thing I rain would have had was a. tobacco-pipe, but it was
impossible for me to make one ; however, I found a contriv-
ance for that, too, at last. I employed myself in planting my
second row of stakes or piles, and in this wickerwork, all the
summer or dry season, when another business took me up
more time than it could be ima ined I could spare.

I mentioned before that I ha a great mind to see the whole
island, and that I had traveled up the brook, and so on to
where I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to
the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved to
travel quite across to the seashore on that side; so, taking
my an, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of
pow er and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a
great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my
journey. 'When I had passed the vale where my bower stood,
as above, I came within view of the sea to the west, and it
bein a very clear day, fairly descried land--whether an
islan or a continent I could not tell ; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the \V. to the W.S.W'., at a very great dis-
tance ; by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off.

fcould not tell what part of the world this might be, other-
wise than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as
I concluded, by all my observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, if
I should have landed, I had been in a worse condition than I
was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered
ever thing for the best ; I say I quieted my mind with this,
and eft afliicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered that
if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time
or other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but
if not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and the Brazils, which were indeed the worst of savages; for
they are cannibals, and fail not to murder and devour all the
human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward.
I found that side of the island where I now was much pleasanter
than mine--the open savanna fields sweet,| adorned with
flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw <<abun-
dance of parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible,
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did,
after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked itlreposed in my hut with my family.

down with a stick, andhaving recovered it, I brought it home ;
but it was some years before I could make him speak ; how-
ever, at last, I taught him to call me by my name very famil-
iarl . But the accident that followed, though it be a trifle,
wil be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in
the low ground hares (as I thought them to be and foxes ;but
they differed greatly from all the other kinds had met with,
nor could I satisf myself to eat them, thou h I killed several.
But I had no nee to be venturous, for I ha no want of food,
and of that which was very good, too, especially these three
sorts, viz., goats, pi eons, and turtle, or tortoise, which, added
to my grapes, Lea enhall Market could not have furnished a
table better than I, in proportion to the company ; and thou h
In case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thali-
fu ness that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but
had rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never traveled in this journe above two miles outright in
a day, or thereabouts ; but I too so many turns and returns
to see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough
to the place where I resolved to sit down for all night; and
then I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself
with a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from one
tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at me
without waking me. As soon as Icame to the seashore I was
surprised to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side
of the island, for here, indeed, the shore was covered with in-
numerable turtles, whereas on the other side I had found but
three in a car and a half. Here was also an infinite number
of fowls 0 many kinds, some of which I had not seen before,
and many of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the
names of, except those called penguins. .

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was ve sparing
of my powder and shot, and therefore had more min to kill a
she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on; and thou h
there were many goats here, more than on the other side of t 1e
island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than When I was on the hills.

I confess this side of the countr was much pleasanter than
mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as
I was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me, and I
seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey,
and from home. However, I traveled along the shore of the
sea toward the cast, I suppose about twelve miles, and then set-
ting up a at pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I
would 0 ome again, and that the next journey I took should
be on t e other side of the island east from my dwelling, and
so round till I came to my post again, of which in its lace.

I took another way to come back than that I went, t inkin
I could easily keep all the island so much in my view that
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country;
butI found m self mistaken, for, belng come about two or
three miles, I ound myself descended into a very large valley,
but so surrounded with hills, and those bills covered With wood,
that I could not see which was my way by any direction but
that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the posi-
tion of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to my
further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or
four days while I was in this valley, and not bein able to see
the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortable, an at last was
obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, and come back
the same wa I went: and then, by easy journeys, I turned
homeward, t e weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, am-
munition, hatchet, and other things, very heav .

In this journey my dog surprised a young id, and seized
upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, can ht it, and saved
it alive from the do . I had a great mind to ring it home if
I could, for I had 0 ten been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raisea breed of tame oats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot shou d be
spent. I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string,
which I made of some rope-yam which I always carried about
me, Iled him along, though with some difiiculty, till I came to
my bower, and there I inclosed him and left him, for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above
a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This
little wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had
been so unpleasant to me that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and
it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I re-
solved I would never go a great way from' it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after
my lon journey; during which, most of the time was taken
up in t e weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who
began now to be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well ac-
quainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kidCauses Ax>> ms Funk--Page 86.
which I had ent in within my little circle, and resolved to go
and fetch it ome, or ive it some food; accordingly I went,
and found it where I eft it, for indeed it could not get out,
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw them over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before,
to lead it away ; but it was so tame with being hungry, thatI
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog ; and
as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,
and so fond, that it became from that time one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island,
having now been there two years, and no more rospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowled ments of the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary con ition was at-
tended with, and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that God
had been pleased todiscover to me that it was possible I might
be more happy in this solitary condition than I should have
been in a liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the
world ; that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of
my solitary state, and the want of human society, by his pres-
ence, and the communication of his grace to my soul ; sup-
porting, oomforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
providence here, and hope for his eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibl to feel how much more
happy the life I now led was, wit all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days ; and now having chan ed both my sor-
rows and my joys, my very desires altere , m affections
changed their gusts, and my delights were perfect y new from
what they were at first coming, or, indeed, for the two years

ast.
P Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for
viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart
would die within me,to think of the woods, the mountains,
the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner, locked up with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited
wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a
storm and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child ;
sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together ; and this was still worse
to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by
words, it would go off, and the grief having exhausted itself
would abate.

But now I bean to exercise myself with new thoughts. I
daily read the Word of God, and applied all the comforts of
it to my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened
the Bible upon these words, " I will never leave thee, nor for-
sake thee." Immediately it occurred that these words were
to me; why else should they be directed in such a manner,
just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition,
as one forsaken of God and man ? " Well, then," said I, "if
God does not forsake-me, of what ill consequence can it be,
or what matters it, though the world should all forsake me,
seeing on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should
lose the favor and blessing of God, there would be no com-
parison in the loss ?"

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it
was possible for me to be more happ in this forsaken, sol-
itary condition, than it was probable should ever have been
in any other particular state in the world; and with this
thought I was oing to give thanks to God for bringing me
to this place. know not what it was, but something shocked
in mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.
" ow canst thou become such a hypocrite," said I, even
aiidibly, "to pretend to be thankful for a condition, which,
however thou mayest endeavor to be contented with, thou
wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?" So I
stopped there ; but though I could not say I thanked God for
being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for o ening
my eyes, by whatever afflicting pi-ovidences, to see the ormer
condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and
repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul
Within me blessed God for directing my friend in En land,
without any order of mine, to pack it up amon my goo s, and
for assisting me afterwards to save it out of t e wreck of the

shi .

films, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year ;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so par-
ticular an account of my works this year as the first ; yet in
general it may be observed that I was very seldom idle, but
having regularly divided my time according to several daily
employmeiits that were before me, such as, first, my duty to
God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set
a art some time for, thrice every day; secondly, the going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took up three
hours in every morning, when it did not ram; thirdly, the
ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
caught for my supply : these took up great part of the day ;
also, it is to be cousi ered, that in the middle of the day, when
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great
to stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all
the time I could be supposed to work in, with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working,
and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in
the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labor, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work ; the man hours
which for want of tools, want of help, and want of ski! , every-
thing I did took up out of my time : for example, I was full
two-and-forty days in making a board for 2. Ion shelf, which
I wanted in my cave ; whereas two sawyers, With their tools
and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree
in half a day.

My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be
cut down, because my board was-to be a broad one. This tree
I was three days a-cutting down, and two more cutting off the
boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of
it into chips till it began to be light enough to move ; then I
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board
from end to end; then tnrnin that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the p ank to be about three inches
thick, and smooth on both Sides. Any one may iiudgejhc
labor of my hands in such a piece of work; but abor and
patience carried me through that, and many other things ; I
only observe this in particular, to show the reason wh so much
of my time went away with so little work, viz., that w at might
be a little to be done with help and tools, was avast labor and
required a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But
notwithstanding this, with patience and labor I went through
many things, and indeed everything that my circumstances
made necessar to me to do, as will up car by what follows.

I was now, in the months of November and December, ex-
pecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had ma-
nured or dug up for them was not great ; for, as I observed, m
seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck, for
had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season : but now
my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was
in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts,
which it was scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first, the
goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, which, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as
it came up, and eat it so close that it could get no time to
shoot u into stalk. _

This saw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil, and the
more, because it required a great deal of speed ; the creatures
dail spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land was but
sma , suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about
three weeks' time ; and shootin some of the creatures in the
daytime, I set my dog to guar it in the night, tying him up
to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night
long; so in a litt e time the enemies forsook the place, and
the corn grew' very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in
the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it
was in the ear; for oing along by the place to see how it
throve, I saw my litt e crop surrounded with fowls, of I know
not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I
should be gone. I immediate] let fly among them, for I
always had my gun with me. had no sooner shot, but there
rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from
among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes ; that I should be starved, and
never be able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not
tell ; however, I resolved not to lose my corn. if possible,
though I should watch it night and day. In the first lace, I
went among it to see what damage was already done, and found
they had s oiled a ood deal of it ; but that as it was et too
green for t em, the oss was not so great, but the remain er was
likely to be a good crop, if it could be saved.

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved it
to be so ; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner
out of their si ht, but they dro ped down one by one into the
corn again. was so provoke thatI could not have patience
to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain that they
eat now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me, in the con-
se uence ; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and
kil ed three of them. This was what I wished for; so I took
them up, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in Eng-
land, v1z., hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It is
impossible, to imagine almost that this should have had such an
efiect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at the
corn, but, in short, they forsook all that art of the island, and
I could never see abird near the place as ong as m scarecrows
hung there. This I was very glad of, you may e sure, and
about the latter end of December, which was our second har-
vest of the (year, I reaped my com.

I was 89. 1y put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down,
and all I con (1 do was to make one, as well as I could, out of
one of my broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the
arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I
had no great diflicu ty to cut it down ; in short, I reaped it in
my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it awa
in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out wit
my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found that
out of my half-peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and

'above two bushels and a half of barley ; that is to say, by my
guess, for I had no measure at that time.

However, this was a eat encouragement to me, and I fore-
saw that in time it won d please God to supply me with bread ;
and yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to
grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and
part it ; nor, if made into meal how to make bread of it ; and
If how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it ; these things
being added to my desire of having a ood quantity for store,
and to secure a constant supply, I reso ved not to taste any of
this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season ;
and, in the mean time, to employ all my study and hours of
working to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.

It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. It
is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little things
necessary in par-oviding, producing, curing, dressing, making,
and finishing t is one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to
my daily discouragement and was made more and more sensible
of it every hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-
corn which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed
to a surprise.

First, I had no plow to turn up the earth ; no spade or shovel
to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden
spade, as I observed before ; but this did my work but in a
wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days to
make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only were out the sooner,
but made my work the harder, and made it be performed much
worse. However, this I here with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the
performance. When the corn was sown, Ihad no barrow, but
was forced to go over it myself, and dranr a great heavy bough
of a tree over it to scratch it, as it may he called, rather than
rake or harrow it. When it was growing, or grown, I have
observed already how many things wanted to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from
the chafl', and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves
to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven
to bake it in; and all these things I did without, as shall be
observed; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and ad-
vantage to me too. But this, as I said, made everything labori-
ous and tedious to me ; but that there was no help for ; neither
was my time so much loss to me, because, as I divided it, a certain
part of it was every day appointed to these works; and as I
ad resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater
quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself
wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself With utensils
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for mak-
m%the corn, when I had it fit for my use. '
at first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I
had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which, when it
was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and re-
quired double labor to work with it. However, I went through
that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced
them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of
that wood which I had set before, which I knew would grow ;
so that, in one year's time, I knew I should have a quick or
livinghednre, that would want but little repair. This work was
not so littie as to take me up less than three months, because
great part of that time was of the wet season, when I could not
go abroad. Within-door, that is when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employmentin the following occupations--
always observing that all the while I was at work I diverted
myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak ;
andI uickly learnt him to know his own name, and at last to
speak it out pretty loud, " Poll," which was the first word I
ever heard spoken in the island by any month but my own.
This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands,
as follows: viz., I had long studied, by some means or other,
to make myself some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted
sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However, con-
sidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could
find out any cla , I might botch up some such pot as might,
beingldried by t Ie sun, be hard enough and strong enough to
bear andling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required
to be kept so ; and as this was necessary in preparingcorn, meal,
etc., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some
as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what
should be ut into them.

It woul make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste ; what
odd, misshapen, ugly things I made ; how many of them fell
in, and how many fell out--the clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own weight ; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of the sun, being set out too hastil ; and how many fell
to pieces with only removing, as well be ore as after they were
dried; and, in a word, how, after having labored hard to find
the clay--to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work
it--I could not make above two large earthen ugly things (I
cannot call them jars) in about two months' labor.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two great
wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that
they might not break ; and as between the pot and the basket
there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and
barley straw'; and these two pots being to stand always dry,
I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when
the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yet I made several smaller things with better success; such as

ittle round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any-
thing my hand turned to ; and the heat of the sun baked them
strangely hard

But all this would not answer my end, which was tolget an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire ; which
none of these could do. It happened after some time, making
a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it
out after I had done with it I found a broken piece of one of
my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone,
and red as atile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said
to myself that certainly they might be made to burn whole, 1f
they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire so as to make it
burn , me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some
lead to do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two
or three pots, in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood
all round it, with a great hea of embers under them. I plied
the fire with fresh fuel roun the outside, and upon the to ,
till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and o -
served that they did not crack at all ; when I saw them clear
red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till
I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ;
for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the
violence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I had
gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to
abate of the red color, and watching them all night, that I
might notxlet the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three
very good (I will not say handsome pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as eoul be desired, and one of
them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort
of earthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to the
shapes of them they were very indifferent, as any one may sup-
pose, when I had no way of making them but as the children
make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies that never
learned to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever e ual to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that wou d bear
the fire ; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold
before I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil
me some meat, which it did admirably well ; and with a piece
of a kid I made some very ood broth, though I wanted oat-
meal and several other ingredients requisite to make it as good
as I would have had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or
beat some corn in ; 'for as to the mill, there was no thought of
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To
supply this want I was at a great loss ; for, of all the trades in
the world, I was as perfeetl unqualified for a stone-cutter as for
any whatever; neither ha I any tools to go about it with. I
spent many a day to find out a great stone bi enough to cut hol-
low, and make fit fora mortar, and could fin none at all, except
what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or
cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness
sufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which would
neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the
com without filling it with sand So, after a great deal of
time lost in searchm for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved
to look out a great b ock of hard wood, which I found indeed
much easier ; and getting~one as big as I had strength to stir,
I rounded it and formed it on the outside with m ax and
hatchet, and then, with the help of fire and infinite la or, made
a hollow place in it,as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes.
After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or heater, of the wood
called the iron-wood ; and this I pre ared and laid by against
I had my next crop of corn, whichlI roposed to myself to
grind, or rather pound my corn or mea , to make my bread.

My next difliculty was to make a sieve, or scarce, to dress
mg meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk; without
w ich I did not see it ossible I could have an bread. This
was a most difficult thm , so much as but to t ink on, for to
be sure I had nothing like the necessary things to make it
with; I mean fine thm canvas, or stuff, to scarce the meal
through. And here I was at a full stop for many months;
nor did I really know what to do. Linen I had none left but
what was mere rags; I had oats' hair, but neither knew I
how to weave or spin it; and ad I known how, here were no
tools to work with. All the remedy that I found for this was,
that at last I did remember I had, among the seamen's clothes
which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico
or muslin; and with some pieces of these I made three small
sieves, but proper enough for the work ; and thus I made
shift for a good many years; howI did afterwards, I shall
show in its place.

The bakin part was the next thing to be considered, and
how I shoul make bread when I came to have corn; for,
first, I had no yeast ; as to that part, as there was no sup ly-
ing the want, so I did not concern myself much about it. at
for an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I found out
an experiment for that also, which was this: I made some
earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about
two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I
burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by;
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon.the
hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own
making and burning also ; but I should not call them
square.

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers,
or live coals, I drew them forward upon the hearth, so as to
cover it all over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was
very hot ; then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my
loaf or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot upon them,
drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in
and add to the heat ; and thus, as well as in the best ovep in
the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became, in little
time, a good pastry-cook into the bargain ; for I made in -
self several cakes and puddings of the rice; indeed I ma e
no pies, neither had I anything to ut into them, supposing I
had, except the flesh either of few 3 or goats.

It need not be wondered at if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here ; for, it is to be
observed that, in the intervals of these things, I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage ; for I reaped my corn in
its season, and carried it home as well as I cou d, and laid it up
in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out,
for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it
with. .

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger; I wanted a lace to lay it
u in, for the increase of the corn now yieldedJ me so much
t at I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice
as much, or more ; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to
use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great
while; also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufiicient
for me a whole year, and to sow but once a ear.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty ushels of barley
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so
I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year thatI
sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully pro-
vide me with bread.

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure in
thoughts ran many times u on the prospect of land whichI
had seen from the other si e of the island; and I was not
without secret wishes that I was on shore there, fancyin that,
seeing the mainland, and a inhabited country, I mig t find
some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at
last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of
savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far
worse than the lions and tigers of Africa: that if I once came
into their ower I should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of eing killed, and perhaps of being eaten ; for I had
heard that the poo le of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals,
or men-eaters andII knew by the latitude that I could not be far
of from that shore 1 That suppose they were not cannibals,yetCIWSOE Burma H13 Cons AND hawk--1'11" 116.
they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their
hands had been served, even when they had been ten or
twenty to ether--much more I, that was but one, and could
make litte or no defense; all these things, I say, which I
ought to have considered well of, and I did cast up in my
thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehensions
at first, and my head ran mightily upon the thought of get-
tinlg over to that shore.

ow, I wished for my boy Xury, and the longboat with
the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thou-
sand miles on the coast of Africa: but this was in vain : then
I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I
have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in the
storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first, but not quite, and was turned, by the force of
the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against the
high ridge of beachy, rou h sands, but no water about her as
before. If I had had ban 3 to have refitted her, and to have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done well
enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her
easily enough ; but I might have easily foreseen that I could no
more turn her and set her upri ht upon her bottom than I could
remove the island ; however, went to the wood, and cut levers
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to try what
I could do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her
down, I might easily repair the dama e she had received, and
she would be a very good boat, and might go to sea in her
very easily

I spare no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it; at last, finding
it impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again,
or to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the
water; so I was forced to give it over; and yet, though I
gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for
the main increased rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not pos-
sible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of
those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say,with-
out hands--viz, of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only
thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely wit
my thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the Negroes or ndians; but
not at all considering the particular inconveniences which I
lay under more than the ndians did, viz., want of hands to
move it into the water when it was made--a difficulty much
harder for me to surmount than all the consequences of want
of tools could be to them. For what was it to me, that when
I had chosen a vast tree in the wood, I might with great trou-
ble cut it down, if after I might be able with my tools to how
and dub the outside into the pro _ r shape of a boat, and burn
or cut out the inside to make it ollow, so as to make a boat
of it--if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the water?

One would have thought I could not have had the least re-
flection upon my mind of my circumstances while I was makin
this boat, but I should have immediately thought how I shoulfi
get it into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that I never once considere how
should get it ofi the land ; and it was really, in its own nature,
more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than
about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat
in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did, who had any of his senses awake. I leased myself
with the design without determining whether was ever able
to undertake it ; not but that the difliculty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I lint a stop to my inquiries into
it, by this foolish answer which gave myself : " Let me first
make it; I warrant I shall find some way or other to get it
along when it is done."

This was amost preposterous method ; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar tree.
I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the
building the Temple at Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven
inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet; after which
it lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was
not without infinite labor that I felled this tree. I was twenty
days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen
more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading
head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with my
ax and hatchet, and inexpressible labor ; after this, it cost me
a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something
like the bottom of aboat, that it might swim upright as it ought
to do. It cost me near three months more to clear the inside,
and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it ; this I did,
indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint
of hard labor, till I had brought it to be a very handsome peri-
agua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and
consequent] big enough to have carried me and all my car 0.

When I ad gone through this work, I was extremely e-
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I
saw a canoe or a periagua, that was made of one tree, in my
life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure--for
there remained nothing but to get it into the water ; and had I
gotten it into the water, I make no question but I should have
begun the maddest voya e, and the most unlikely to be per-
formed, that ever was un ertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me ; though
they cost infinite labor too. It lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more ; but the first inconvenience was,
it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this dis-
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth,
and so make a declivity. This I began, and it cost me a ro-
di ious deal of pains (but who grudge pains that have t eir
de iverance in view '1') ; but when this was worked through, and
this difficulty managed, it was still much at one, for I could no
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I meas-
ured the distance of the ground, and resolved to cut a dock or
canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not
bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work ;
and when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it
was to be dug, how broad, how the stufi was to be thrownout,
I found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but
my own-,- it must have been ten or twelve years before I could
have gone through with it ; for the shore lay so high that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep ; so
at length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt
over also.

This grieVed me heartily; and now I saw, though too late,
the folly of beginnin a work before we count the cost, and
befgre we judge rig tly of our own strength to go through
wit it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and
with as much comfort as ever before; for, by a constant study
and serious application of the Word of God, and b the assist-
ance of his grace, I gained a difi'erent knowledge rom what I
had before. I entertained difierent notions of thin s. I
looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which had
nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, nodesires
about : in a word, I had nothin indeed to do with it, nor was
ever likely to have. So I thong t it looked, as we may perhaps
look upon it hereafter, viz., as a lace I had lived in, ut was
come out of it ; and well might say, as Father Abraham to
Dives, " Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed."

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of
the world here ; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had
all I was now ca able of enjoying ; I was lord of the whole
manor ; or, if I p eased, I might call myself king or emperor
over the whole country which I had possession of. There were
no rivals ; I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or
command with me. I might have raised ship-ladings of corn,
but I had no use for it; so I lot as little grow as I thou ht
enough for my occasion. I had tortoises or turtles enough, ut
now and then one was as much as I could put to any use. I had
timber enough to have builtafleet of ships ; and I had grapes
enou h to have made wine, or to have cured into raisms, to
have oaded that fleet when it had been built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable : I had
enough to eat and to supply my wants, and what was all the
rest to me? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the do
must eat it, or the vermin ; if I sowed more com than I can]
eat, it must be spoiled ; the trees that I cut down were lying
to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them than
for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me,
upon just reflection, that all t e good things of this world are
no further good to us than the are for our use ; and that,
whatever we may heap up indee to give others, we may enjoy
as much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous, grip-
ing miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of
covetousness, if he had been in my case; for I possessed in-
finitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room
for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they
were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use to me. I had, as
I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorr , use-
less stufi' lay I I had no manner of business for it; and often
thought with myself that I would have given a handful of it
for a gross of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to grind my
corn ; nay, I would have given it all for six enny-worth of
turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a andful of one
and beans and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the cast
advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew moldy with the damp of the cave in the wet seasons ;
and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the
same case, they had been of no manner of value to me, because
of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in it-
self than it was at first and much easier to my mind, as well as
to my body. I fre uently sat down to meat with thankful-
ness, and admired t e hand of God's providence, which had
thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned to look more
upon the bright side of m condition, and less upon the dark
side, and to consider what enjoyed rather than whatI wanted ;
and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts that I can-
not express them ; and which I take notice of here, to put those
discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfort-
ably what God has given them, because they see and covet
something that he has not given them. All our discontents
about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want
of thankfulness for what we have.

. Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless
would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as
mine was ; and this was, to compare my present condition
with whatI at first ex ected it would be ; nay, with what it
would certainly have een, if the good provrdence of God
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to
the shore, where I not onl could come at her, but could bring
what I got out of her to t e shore, for my relief and comfort;
without which, I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for de-
fense, and unpowder and shot for getting my food.

Ispent w ole hours, I ma say whole da s, in representin
to myself, in the most live ycolors, how must have acte
if I had got nothing out of the ship. How I could not have so
much as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it
was long before I found any of them, I must have erished
first; that I should have lived, if I had not perishe , like a
mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by an
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the fies
from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw
it with my teeth, and all it with my claws, like a beast.

. These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition,
with all its hardships and misfortunes ; and this part also I
cannot but recommend to the reflection of these who are a t,
in their misery, to say, " Is any affliction like mine?" et
them consider how, much worse the cases of some people are,
2nd their case might have been, if Providence had thought
t.

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort.
my mind with ho es; and this was comparing my present sit-
uation with what had deserved, and had therefore reason to
expect from the hand of Providence. Ihad lived a dreadful
life, erfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God.
Ih been well instructed by father and mother ; neitherhad
they been wantin to me, in their early endeavors to infuse a
religious awe of 0d into my mind, a sense of my duty, and
what the nature and end of my being required of me. But
alas! falling early into the seafaring life, which, of all lives, is
the most destitute of the fear of (10d, though his terrors are
always before them ; I say, falling early into the seafarin life,
and Into seafaring company, all that little sense of re igion
which Ien'tertained was laughed outof me by my messmates;
by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death,
which grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all
manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what
was like myse , or to hear anything of what was good, or tended
towards it.

So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliv--
erances I enjo ed--such as my escape from Sallee ; my being
taken up by t e Portu uese master of the ship; my being

lanted so well in the razils; my receiving the cargo from

n land, and the like--I never once had the words, " Thank
Go l" so much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the
greatest distress had I so much thought as to pra to him, or
so much as to say, "Lord, have mercy upon me ! ' no, not to
mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blas-
pheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months
as I have already observed, on the account of my Wicked and
hardened life past ; and when I looked about me, and considered
what articular providences had attended me since my coming
into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me--
had not only punished me less than my ini uity had deserved,
but had so plentifully provided for me--tiis gave me reat
hopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God ha yet
mercies in store for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not onl to
resignation to the will of God in the present disposition o my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con-
dition ; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to com-
lain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins. That
{enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have ex-
pected in that place. That I ought never more to re ine at
my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks or that
daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought. That I ought to consider I had been fed even by a
miracle, even as great as that of feeding Eli'ah by ravens ; nay,
by a long series of miracles. And that could hardly have
named a place in the uninhabited part of the world where I
could have been cast more to my advantage ; a place where,
as I had no society, which was my aflliction on one hand, so I
found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten
my life ; no venomous creatures or poisonous, which I might
have fed on to my hurt ; no savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a
life of mere another ; and I wanted nothing to make it a life
of comfort, ut to be able to make my sense of God's goodness
to me, and care over me in this condition, be in daily conso-
lation ; and after I made a just improvement 0 these things,
I went away, and was no more sad. I had now been here so
long, that many things which I brought on shore for my help
were either quite gone, or very much wasted and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a
very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little,
till it was so ale, it scarce left an appearance of black upon
the paper. long as it lasted made use of it to minute
down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me ; and first, by casting up times past, I remem-
bered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the vari-
ous providences which befell me, and which, if I had been
superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I
might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal
of curiosit .

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee
man-of-war, and made a slave ; the same da of the ear that
I escaped out of the wreck of that shi in armout Roads,
that same day of the year afterwards made my escape from
Sallee in a boat ; the same day of the year I was born on, viz.
the 20th of September, the same day I had my life so miracu-
lously saved twent -six years after, when I was cast on shore
in this island ; so t at my wicked life and solitary life began
both on a da .

The next thing to myinkbeing wasted, was that of my bread,
I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship ; this I had
husbanded to the last degree, allowing in self but one cake of
bread a day for above a year; and yet was quite without
bread for a ear before I got any corn of my own ; and great
reason I hady to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting
it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes too, began to decay mightily ; as to linen, I had
had none 3. good w ile, except some checkered shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully
preserved ; because many times I could bear no other clothes on

ut a shirt: and it wasa very reat help to me that I had,
among all the men's clothes of t c ship, almost three dozen of
shirts. There were also several thick watch--coats of the sea-
menls which were left behind, but they were too hot to wear:
and though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that
there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked--
no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor
could I abide the thoughts of it, though I was all alone. One
reason why I could not go naked was, I could not bear the
heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes
on ; nay, the very heat fre uentl blistered my skin ; whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itse f ma e some motion, and whistling
under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more
could I everbring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without
a cap or a hat ; the heat of the sun, beatin with such violence
as it does in that place, would give me the eadache resently,
by dartin so directly on my head, without a cap or at on, so
that I cou d not bear it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would
presently go away.

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order ; I had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to
try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
w ich I had by me, and with such other materials as I had ; so
I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed, batching, for I made
most piteons work of it. However, I made shift to make two
or three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry
shift indeed till afterwards.

. I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
thatI killed,I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of
them were so dry and hard that the were fit for little, but
others, it seems, were very useful. The first thing I made of
these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside'I had much laborto make me a canoe.
I'm/w "1'70"".5'04'.
to shoot of the rain ; and this I erformed so well, that after,
I made me a suit of clothes who ly of those skins--that is to
say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both
loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep
me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were
wretcheilty made ; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse
tailor. owever, they were such as I made a very good shift
with, and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair
of the waistcoat and cap beingi outermost, I was kept very dry.

After this, I spent a reat eal of time and pains to make an
umbrella. I was indee in great want of one, and had a great
mind to make one. I had seen them made in the Brazils, where
they are very useful in the great heats which are there, and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being
nearer the equinox ;besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,
it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the
heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while be-
fore I could make anything likely to hold ; nay, after I thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to
my mind. But at last I made one that answered indifferently
well ; the main difficulty I found was to make it to let down.
I could make it spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw
in, it would not be portable for me any way but just over my
head, which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made
one to answer. I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so
that it cast off the rain like a pent-house and kept of the sun
so effectually that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather
with reater advantage than I could before in the coolest, and
when had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under my
arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed by resi ning to the will of God, and throwing my-
self wholly upon t 1e disposal of his rovidence. This ma e my
life better than sociable, for when be an to regret the want
of conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus conversin
mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I may sa wit
even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was not etter
than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?

I cannot say that, after this for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the
same posture and place, just as before. The chief thin I was
employed in, besides my yearly labor of lanting my bar ey and
rice, and curing my raisins--of both w ich I always kept up
just enough to have sufficient stock of the year's provision be-
forehand--I say, besides this yearly labor, and my daily labor
of going out with my gun, I had one labor to make me a canoe,
which at last I finished ; so that, by digging a canal to it of
six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek,
almost half a mile. .As for the first, which was so vastly big,
as I made it without considering beforehand, as I ought to do,
how I should be able to launch it, so, never being able to bring
it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let
it he where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser
the next time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not get
a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not get
the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, of near
half a mile, et, as I saw it was practicable at last, I nevergave
it over ; an though I was near two years about it, yet I never
grudged my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at
last.

However, thou h my little periagua was finished, yet the size
of it was not at aliganswerable to the design which I had in view
when I made the first; I mean of venturing over to the term
firma, where it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and
now I thought no more of it. As I had a boat, my next design
was to make a tour round the island ; for as I had been on the
other side in one place, crossing, as I have already described it,
over the land, so the discoveries I made in that journey made
me very ea er to see other parts of the coast ; and now I
had a boat, thought of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do everything with dis-
cretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat,
and made a sail to it out of some of the piecesof the ship's sails
which la in store, and of which I had a great store by me.
Having tted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she
would sail very well ; then I made little lockers, or boxes, at
each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, ammunition,
etc., into, to be kept dr , either from rain or the spray of the,
sea; and a little, long, ollow place I cut in the inside of the
boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down
over it, to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbre la also in a step at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off of me,
like an awning. And thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea ; but never went far out, nor far from the
creek. At last, being eager to view the circumference of in
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour ; and accordingly I
victualcd my shi for the voyage, utting in two dozen of

earthen pot full (if plarch'ed 'rice(a food I ate a great deal of), a
little bottle of rum, alf a goat, and powder with shot for kill-
ing more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I men-
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I
took, one to lie upon and the other to cover me in the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or
my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this v0 3 e,
and I found it much longer than I expected ; for thong fine
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east
side of it, I found a great le ge of rocks lie out about two
leagues-into sea, some above water, some under it ; and be ond
that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more so that was
oblviged to go a rest way out to sea to double that point.

hen I rst iscovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
obli e me to go out to sea; and, above all, doubting how I
shou d get back again ; so I came to an anchor; for I had made
a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which
I at out of the ship. _
aving secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing u a hill, which seemed to overlook that point where
I saw the ull extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong and, indeed, a most furious current, which ran
to the east, and even came close to the point ; and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger,
that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the
strength of it, and not be able to make the island again. And,
indeed, had I not get first upon this hill, I believe it would have
been so ; for there was the same current on the other side of
the island, only that it set olf at a farther distance, and I saw
there wasa strong eddy under the shore ; so I had nothing to
do but to get out of the first current, and I should presently be
in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the cur-
rent, made a great breach of the sea upon the point ; so that
it was not safe for me to kee too close to the shore for the
breach, nor to go too far off, ecause of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over-
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured. But I am a warning-
piece to all rash and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I come
to the point, when I was not even my boat's length from the
shore, but I found myself in a oreat depth of water, and a cur-
rent like the sluice of a mill. it carried my boat along with it
with such violence that all I could do could not. keep her so
much as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me farther
and farther out from the edd , which was on my left hand.
There was no wind stirring to iielp me, and all that I could do
with my paddles signified nothing. And now I began to give
myself over for lost ; for, as the current was on both sides of
the island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they must join
again, and then I was irreeoverable gone ; nor did I see any

ossibility of avoiding it ; so that I had no prospect before me
but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but
of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found atortoise on the
shore, as bi almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the
boat; and had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one
of my earthen pots; but what was all this to being driven into
the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no main-
land or island, for a thousand leagues at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make the most miserable condition that mankind could be in
worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island as
the most leasant place in the world, and all the ha piness my
heart could wish for was to be there again. I stretched out In
hands to it, with eager wishes. "0 happy desert ! " said ,
" I shall never see thee more. 0 miserable creature ! whither
am Igoing ? " Then I reproached myself with my unthankful
temper, and how I had rep'ined at my solitary condition ; and
now what would I give to be on shore there again ! Thus, we
never see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to
us b its contraries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but
by the want of it. It is scarcely possible to imagine the con-
sternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved island
(for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost
two lea ues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it
again. owever, I worked hard till, indeed, my strength was
almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the north-
ward--that is, towards the side of the current which the eddy
lay on--as possibly as I could ; when about noon, as the sun
passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in
my face, s ringing up from the S.S.E. This cheered my heart
a little, an especially when, in about half an hour more, it blew
a pretty small, gentle gale. By this time, I had got at a fright-
ful distance from the island ; and had the least cloudyorhazy
weather intervened, I had been undone another way, too ; for
I had no compass on board, and should never have known how
to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost sight
of it. But the weather continuing clear, I applied myself toCnusos Muss A Jounxsn--Pnge 107.
get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing- away to
the north as much as possible, to get out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some al-
teration of the current was near ; for where the current was so
stron the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear,I
foun the current abate ; and resently I found to the east, at
about half a mile, a breach of tEe sea upon some rocks. These
rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the main
stress of it ran away more southerl , leaving the rocks to the
northeast, so the other returned by t e repulse of the rock, and
made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the northwest,
with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to
murder them, or who have been in such extremities, may guess
what my present surprise of jo was, and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this e dy; and the Wind also fresh-
ening, how gladly I 3 read my sail to it, running cheerftu
pefore the wind, an with a strong tide or eddy under-

oot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again,
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more towards
the northward than the current lay which carried me away at
first; so that when I came near the island, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of
the island, op osite to that which I went out from. _

When I ha made somethinar more than a league of way by
help of this current or eddy, found it was spent, and saved
me no farther. However, I found that being between two
great currents, viz., that on the south side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the north, which lay about two leagues
on the other side ; I say, between these two, in the wake of the
island, I found the water at least still, and running no way;
and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I ke t on steerin
directly for the island, though not making such resh way as
did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about
aleague of the island, I found the point of the rocks which oc-
casioned this disaster stretchin out, as is described before, to
the southward, and casting 01f t e current more southerly, had,
of course, made another eddy to the north ; and this I found
very strong, but directly setting the wa my course lay, which
was due west, but almost full north. owever, having a fresh
gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting northwest; and in
about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it
bein smooth water, I soon got to land.

hen I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks
for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my
deliverance by my boat ; and refreshing myselfwith such things
as I had, Ibrou ht my boat close to the shore, in alittle cove that
I had spied un er some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being
quite spent with the labor and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat ! I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the case,
to think of attempting it b the way I went out; and what
might be at the other side I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures. So I resolved
on the next morning to make my way westward along the shore,
and to see if there was no creek where Imight layup my frig-
ate in safety so as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very
good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it
came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very con-
venient harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put in,
and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look
about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I traveled on foot to that shore; so,
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for
it was exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was com-
fortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and
I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found every-
thing standing asI left it; for I always kept it in good order,
being, as I said before, my country-house.

I ot over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my imbs, for I was ver weary, and fell asleep. But judge

on, if you can, that rea mg story, what a surprise I must have

een in when I was awake out of my sleep by a voice, calling
me bymy name several times. " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe !
poor R0 in Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
are you? Where have you been?"

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing or
paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and walking
the latter art, that I did not awake thoroughly; and dozing
between 3 eeping and waking, thought I dreamed that some-
body spoke to me ; but as the voice continued to repent, " Robin
Crusoe! Robin Crusoe l" at last I be an to awake more er-
fectly, and was at first dreadfully frig toned, and starts upCRUSUB AND 1113 Immat--Pngc 111.
in the utmost consternation. But no sooner were my eyes open,
but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, andim-
mediately knew that it was he that spoke to me ; for just in
such a bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach
him ; and he had learned it so perfectly that he would sit
upon m finger, and lay his bill close to in face, and cry " Poor
Robin rusoe ! Where are you? Where ave you been ? How
came you here ?" and such things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that in-
deed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could
compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature got
thither; and then, how he should just kce about the place,
and nowhere else ; but as I was well satis ed it could be no-
body but honest Poll, I got over it ; and holding out my hand,
and callin him by his name, " Poll," the sociable creature came
to me, am? sat u on m thumb, as he used to do, and continued
talkin to me, " oor bin Crusoe '1' and how did I come here?
and w ere had I been?" just as if he had been overjoyed to
see me again ; and soI carried him home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and
had enough to do for man days, to sit still, and reflect upon
the danger I had been in. would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island; but I knew not
how it was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of
the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there
was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and
my very blood run chill, but to think of it ; and as to the other
side of the island, I did not know how it might be there. But
supposing the current ran with the same force a ainst the shore
at t 9 east as it passed by it on the other, I mi t run the same
risk 'of being driven down the stream, and carried by the island,
as I had been before of being carried away from it. So with
these thoughts I contented myself to be without any boat,
though it had been the product of so many months' labor to make
it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of m temper, I remained near a year;
lived a very sedate, retired li e, as you may well suppose ; and my
thoughts being very much composed as to my condition, and
fully comforted in resi ing myself to the dispositions of Provi-
dence, I thought I livedIi-ea 1y very happily in all things, except
that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to ; and I
believe I should, upon occasion, have made a very good carpen-
ter, especially considering how few tools I had.
Besides this,Iarrived at an unex ected erfection in myearth-
enware, and contrived well enoug i to ma e them with a wheel,
which I found infinitely easier and better ; because I made
things round and shaped, which before were filthy things indeed
to look on. But I think I was never more vain of my own per-
formance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than for
my being able to make a tobacco-pipe ; and though it was a
very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red,
like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would
draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had
been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in the ship,
but I forget them at first, not thinking that t ere was tobacco
in the island ; and afterwards, when I searched the ship again,
I could not come at any pipes.

In my wiekerware also I improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me ;
though not very handsome, yet the were such as were very
handy and convenient for layimr tiings up in, or fetching
things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I coul
hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it in ieces,
and bring it home in a basket : and thelike by a turtle ; could
cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh,
which was enough for me, and bring them home in a basket,
and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets were
my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon
as it was dry, and cured ; and kept it in great baskets, instead
of a granary.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerabl ;
and this was a want which it was impossible for me to supp? ,
and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should
have no more owder ; that is to sa , how I should do to kill
any goats. I ad, as I observed in t e third year of my being
here, kept ayoung kid, and bred her up tame ; I was in hopes
of getting a he'kid : but I could not by any means bring it to
pass, till my kid grew to be an old goat ; and as I could never
find in my heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age.

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and as
I have said, my ammunition growing low, I let myself to study
some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could
not catch some of them alive; and particularly, I wanted a
she-goat great with young. To this purpose, I made snares to
hamper them ; and believe they were more than once taken
in them ; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
always found them broken, and my hait devoured. At length,
I resolved to try a pitfall: so I dug several large pits in the
earth, in places where I had observed the goats used to feed,
and over these pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too,
with a great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears
of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap ; and I could
easily erceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the
corn, {gr I could see the marks of their feet. At length, I set
three traps in one night, and going the next morning, I found
them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was
very discouraging. However, I altered my traps; and, not to
trouble you With articulars, going one morning to see my trap?
I found in one 0 them a lar e old he-goat ; and in one of t e
others three kids, a male an two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he
was so fierce,I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say,
to go about to bring him away alive, which was whatI wanted.
I could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end ; so I even let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been frighted out of his wits; but I had
forgot then what I learned afterwards, that hunger will tame
a lion. If I had let him sta there three or four da s without
food, and then have carried im some water to drin , and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids ;
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at
that time: then I went to the three kids, and taking them one
by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some diffi-
culty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be
tame. And now I found that if I e ected to supply myself
with goats' flesh, when I had no pow er or shot left, breeding
some n tame was my only way; when, perha s, I might have
them a out my house like a flock of sheep. ut, then, it oc'
curred to me t at I must keep the tame from the wild, or else
they would always run wild when they grew up ; and the onl
way for this was to have some inclosed piece of ground, we 1
fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them up so eEect-
ually, that those within might not break out, or those without
break in. g

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as
I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first piece
of work was to find out a proper piece of ground ; viz., where
there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them
to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for
all these, being a plain, open piece of meadow land, or savanna
(as our people call it in the western colonies), which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was ver
woody ; I say, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell
them I began by inclosing of this piece of ground in such a
manner, that m hedge or pale must have been at least two
miles about. or was the madness of it so great as to the com-
pass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough
to do it in ; but I did not consider that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass as if they had had the whole island,
and I should have so much room to chase them in that I should
never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me ; so I presently stopped
short, and, for the first beginning, I resolved to inclose a piece
of about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock'increased,
I could add more ground to my inclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first

iece ; and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the

est part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible,
to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them
out of my hand ; so that, after my inclosure was finished, and
I let them loose, the would follow me up and down, bleating
after me for a hand ul of com.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years
more I had three-and~forty, besides several that I took and
killed for my food ; and after that, I inclosed five several pieces
of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into,
to take them as I wanted them, and gates out of one piece of
ground into another.

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too--a thing which indeed in
my beginning I did not so much as think of, and which, when
it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise;
for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two
of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of
it, so I, that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw but-
ter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and
cheese at last, and never. wants it afterwards. How merci-
fully can our Creator treat his creatures, even in those condi-
tions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction !
How can he sweeten the bitterest (providences, and give us
cause to praise him for dungeons an prisons! What a table
was here spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing
at first but to perish for hunger.

It would have made a Store smile to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island ; I had the lives of all my
subjects at absolute command ; I could hang, draw, give life
and liberty and take it away, and no rebels among all my sub-
jects. Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, at-
tended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favorite,
was the only person permitted to talk to me ; my dog, who was
now grown very 01 and crazy, and had found no species to
multiply his kind upon, sat always at my ri ht hand; and two
cats, one on one side the table, and one on t e other, expecting
now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favor.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore
at first, for they were both of them dead, and had been interred
near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I preserved tame; whereas the rest ran wild in the
woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last ; for they
would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at
last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many;
at length the left me. With this attendance and in this plenti-
ful manner lived ; neither could I be said to want anything
but society ; and of that, in some time after this, I was likely
to have too much.

I was somethin impatient, as I have observed, to have the
use of my boat, t ough very loath to run any more hazard;
and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about
the island, and at other times I sat myself down contented
enough without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island where, as I have
said, in my last ramble, I went u the hill to see how the shore
lay, and how the current set, that might see what I had to do ;
this inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I
resolved to travel thither by land; and followin the edge of
the shore, I did so ; but had' any one in Englan met such a
man as I was, it must either have frighted them, or raised a
great deal of lauo-hter : and asI frequently stood still to look
at myself, I could, not but smile at the notion of my traveling
through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a dress.
Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows :

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's skin, with a
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as
to shoot the rain off from running into my neck ; nothing being
so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the
clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down
to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed
breeches of the same ; the breeches were made of the skin of
an old he- oat, whose hair hung down such a length on either
side, that, ' e pantaloons, it reached to the middle of m legs.
Stockin and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair 0 some-
things, scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap
over in legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of
a most arbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew to-
gether with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and
in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on
the other. had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder ; and at the end
of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's
skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot.
At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and
over my head a great clumsy, ugly, goat-skin umbrella, but
which, after all, was the most necessary thin I had about me
next to my gun. As for my face, the color 0 it was really not
so mulatto-llke as one might expect from a man notvat all care-
ful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox.
My heard I had once sufiered to row till it was about a quar-
ter of a yard long ; but as I had fireth scissors and razors suf<<
ficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper
li , which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometau
w iskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee, for
the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did ; of these
moustaehios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough
to hang my hat u on them, but they were of a length and shape
monstrous enoug , and such as in England would have passed
for frightful.

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few
to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I
say no more to that part. In this kind of dress I went my new
journey, and was out five or six days. I traveled first along
the seashore, directly to the place w ere I first brought my boat
to an anchor to et up upon the rocks ; and having no boat now
to take care of,Iwent over the land a nearer way to the same
height thatI was upon before, when, looking forward to the

oint of the rock which lay out, and which I was obliged to

ouble with my boat, as Isaid above, I was surprised to see the
sea all smooth and quiet--no ripplin , no motion, no current,
any more there than in other places. was at astrange loss to
understand this, and resolved to spend some time in the observ-
ing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned
it; but I was resently convinced how it was, viz., that the
tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current
of waters from some great river on the shore, must be the oc-
casion of this current ; and that according as the wind blew
more forcibly from the west or from the north, this current
came near, or went farther from the shore ; for, waiting there-
abouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as be-
fore, only that it ran farther elf, being near half a league from
the shore, whereas in my case it set close u on the shore, and
hurried me in my canoe alongwith it, which at another time it
would not have done.

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but
to observe the ebbing and the flowin of the tide, and I might
very easily brin my boat about the island again; but when I
began to think a out putting it in practice, I had such terror up-
on m spirits at the remembrance of the dan er I had been in,
that could not think of it again with any patience ; but, on the
contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe,
though more laborious--and this was, that I would build, or
rather make me another periagua or canoe ; and so have one for
one side of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two
plantations in the island; one my little fortification or tent,
with the wall about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me,
which by this time I had enlarged into several apartments, or
caves, one within another. One of these, which was the driest
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification,
that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all
filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have given an ac-
count, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of pro-
vision, especially my corn, some in the ear, out off short from
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least ap-
pearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land,
which I ke t duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly
yielded me t eir harvest in its season; and whenever I had
occasion for more com, I had more land adjoining, as fit as
that.

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a toler-
able plantation there also ; for first, I had my little bower, as
I called it, which I kept in repair--that is to say, I kept the
hedge, which circled it in, constantly fitted u to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the insi e; I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but were
now grown very firm and tall, always so cut, that they mi ht
spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more a reea le
shade, which they did eifectually to my mind. In t e mid-
dle of this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a
sail spread over poles set up for that purpose, and which
never wanted an repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a squa or couch, with the skins of the creatures I
had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved ;
and a great watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cattle, that is
to say, my goats ; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of

ains to fence and inclose this ground, I was so anxious to see
it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I
never left - off till, with infinite labor, I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one
another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scarce room to put a hand through between them; which
afterwards, when those stakes grew, as the all did in the next
rainy season, made the inclosure strong ike a wall--indeed
stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary
for my comfortable support; for Iconsidered the keeping upa
breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a livm g mag-
azine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived
in this place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping
them in my reach de ended entirely upon my perfecting my
inclosures to such a e ree that I might be sure of keeping
them together; which, y this method, indeed, I so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had
planted them so very thick I was forced to pull some of them
up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I rin-
cipally depended on for my winter store of raisins, and w ich
I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet ; and, indeed, they were
not aoreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and
refreshing to the ast degree.

As this was also half-way between in other habitation and
the place where I had laid up my boat, generally stayed and
lay ere in my way thither, for I used frequently to visit my
boat ; and I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in
very good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert my.
self, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, scarcely ever
above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehen-
sive of being hurried out of my knowledie again by the cur-
rents or winds, or any other accident. at now I come to a
new scene of my life.

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I
was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I
stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an a parition.
I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear notlhing, nor
see anything ; I went up to a risin ground, to look farther;
I went up the shore, and down the s ore, but it was all one : I
could_see no other impression but that one. I went to it again
to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not be
my fancy; but there was no room for tha.'t;-for there was ex-
actly the print of a foot--toes, heel, and every part of a foot.
How it came thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine.
But after innumerable fluttering thoughts like a man perfectly
confused and out of himself, I came home to my fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to
the last degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps,
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at
a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to describe how
many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented
things to me in ; how many wild ideas were formed every
moment in my fancy, and what strange unacccouutable whim-
seys came into my thoughts by the wa .

When I came to my castle (for so _thinkI called it ever
after this), I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went
over by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in
the rock, which I called a door,I cannot remember ; for never
frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.

I had no slee that night; the farther I was from the occa-
sion of my frig t, the greater my apprehensions were, which
is something contrary to the nature of such things, and espe-
cially to the usual ractice of all creatures in fear; but I was
so embarrassed wit my own frightful ideas of the thing, that
I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to in self, even
though I was now a great way ofi it. Sometimes fancied it
must be the devil; and reason joined in with me upon this
supposition : for how should any other thing in human sha e
come into the place ? Where was the vessel that broug t
them? What marks were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come there ? But then to
think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a
place, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but
to leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for no
purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it--this was
an amazement the other way. I considered that the devil
mi ht have found out abundance of other ways to have terri-
iie me than this of the simple rint of a foot ; that as I lived
quite on the other side of the is and, he would never have been
so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou-
sand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand
too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would
have defaced entirel . All this seemed inconsistent with the
thing itself, and wit all the notions we usually entertain of
the subtlety of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of
all ap rebensions of its being the devil ; and I presently con-
cluded) then, that it must be some more dangerous creature ;
viz., that it must be some of the savages of the mainland
over against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes,
and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had
made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away
again to sea; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this
desolate island as I would have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was
very thankful in my thought, that I was so happy as not to be
thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by
which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me.Manx.

Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their
having found my boat, and that there were people here ; and
that, if so, I should certainly have them come againin greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen that they
should not find me, yet they would find my inclosure, destro
all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and
should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope ; all that
former confidence in God, which was founded upon such
wonderful experience as I had had of his goodness, now van-
ished ; as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto, could not

reserve by his power the provision which he had made for me
by his goodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that
would not sow any more corn one year than would just serve
me till the next season, as if no accident could intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground ; and
this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future
to have two or three years' corn beforehand, so that, whatever
mi ht come, I might not perish for want of bread.
ow strange a checkerwork of Providence is the life of
man ! and by what secret differing springs are the afi'ections
hurried about, as differing circumstances present ! To-day
we love what to-morrow we hate; to--day we seek what to-
morrow we shun ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear,
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exemp-
lified in me at this time in the most lively manner imaginable ;
for I, whose only afiiiction was, that I seemed banished from
human society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the bound-
less ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I
call silent life ; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not
worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear amongst
the rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own
species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to
life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the
supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I
should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or
silent appearance of a man having set his foot on the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life ; and it aiforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recovered my first surprise, I considered that this was
the station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of
God had determined for me ; that as I could not foresee what
the end of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to
dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an
undoubted right by creation to govern and dispose of me ab-
solute] as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who
had 0 ended him, had likewise a judicial ri ht to condemn me
to what punishment he thought fit; and t at it was my part
to submit to hear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him. I then reflected that God, who was not on] righteous,
bnt omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to punis l and afilict
me, so he was able to deliver me ; that if he did not think fit
to do it, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso-
lutel and entirely to his will ; and, on the other hand, it was
my duty also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to at-
tend the dictates and directions of his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say weeks and months ; and one particular effect of my co -
tations on this occasion I cannot omit ; viz., one morning ear y,
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger
from the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me
very much; upon which those words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts : " Call upon me in the day of trouble : I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this, risin
cheerfully out of bed, my heart was not only comforted, but
was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for de-
liverance : when I had done pra 'ng, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first wor s that presented to me were,
" Wait on the Lord ; be of good courage), and he shall
strengthen thy heart : wait, I say, on the rd." It is im-
possible to express the comfort this gave me, and in return I
thankfully lai down the book, and was no more sad; at least,
not on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflec-
tions, it came into my thoughts one day,that all this might be
a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the
print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat ;
this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade my-
self it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing else but my own
foot ; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as
well as Iwas going that way to the boat? Again I considered
also, that I could by no means tell for certain where I had trod,
and where I had not ; and that if, at last, this was only the
print of my own foot, I had played the part of those fools who
try to make stories of s ecters and apparitions, and then are
themselves frighted at t rem more than anybody else.

Now I began to take courage, and to cop abroad again, for
I had not stirred out of my castle for t lree da s and ni hts,
so that I began to starve for provision ; for had litt e or
nothing within doors but some barley-cakes and water. Then
I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usu-
ally was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were
in reat pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed,
1t afimost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartenmg myself, therefore, with the belief that this was
nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and so I might
be truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to o abroad
again, and went to my country-house to milk my floc ;but to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my
basket, and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thou ht I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been atel most terribly frighted ; and so, indeed, I had. How-
ever, as went down thus two or three days, and having seen
nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was
really nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I could not
persuade myself fully of t is till I should go down to the shore
again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it b my own,
and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that mi ht be
assured it was my own foot. But when I came to the p ace--
first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat,
I could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts; sec~
ondly, when came to measure the mark with my own foot, I
found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things
filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapors
again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one
in an ague ; and I went home again, filled with the belief that
some man or men had been on shore there ; or, in short, that
the island was inhabited, and Imight be surprised before I was
aware ; and what course to take for my security I knew not.
Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed
with fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which
reason offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to
myself was, to throw down my inclosures, and turn all my tame
cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find them
and then frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like
booty; then the sim 1e thing of digging up my two cornfields,
that theymightnot fibd such a grain there, and still be prompted
to fre uent the island ; then to demolish m bower and tent,
that trey might not see any vestiges of abitation, and be
rgmpted to look farther, in order to find out the persons in-
a itin .

Thesg were the subjects of the first night's cogitations, after I
was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so
overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head wasfull of
vapors as above. Thus, fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes ;
and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the
evil which we are anxious about ; but, which was worse than
all this, I had not that relief in this trouble, from the resignation
I used to practice, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,
like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were
upon him, but that God had forsaken him ; for I did not now
take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my
distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done before,
for my defense and deliverance ; which if I had done, I had at
least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise,
and perhaps carried through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night;
but in the morning I fell asleep ; and aving by the amusement
of my mind been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted,
I slept very soundly, and awaked much better composed than
I had ever been before. And now I began to think sedately ;
and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that this
island (which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no
farther from the mainland than as I had seen) was not so
entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that although there
were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, et that there
might sometimes come boats 05 from the shore, w 0 either with
desi n, or perhaps never but when the were driven by cross
win 3, mig t come to this place ; that had lived here fifteen
years now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure of
any people yet ; and that, if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they
could, seeintr they had never thought fit to fix here upon any
occasion to this time ; that the most I could suggest any danger
from was, from any casual accidental landinty of straggling
people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven

ither, were here against their wills ; so they made no stay
here, but went off again,with all possible speed, seldom staying
one night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the
tides and daylight back again ; and that, therefore, I had
nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should
see any savages land upon the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said,
came out beyond where my ortiflcation joined to the rock.
Upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted adouble
row of trees about twelve ears before, of which I made men-
tion ; these trees having een planted so thick before, there
wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that they
should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon fin-
ished. So that I had now a double wall ; and m outer wall
was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, an everything
I could think of to make it strong, having in it seven little holes,
about as bi as I might ut my arm out at. In the inside of
this, I thic ened my wal to about ten feet thick, continually
bringing earth out of my cave, and layin it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it ; and throu h t e seven holes I con-
trived to plant the muskets, of which took notice that I got
seven on shore out of the shi ; these I say, I planted like my
cannon, and fitted them into rames, that held them like a car-
riage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes'
time. This wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and
yet never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall,
for a great way every way, as full wit stakes or sticks of the
osier-like wood, which I found so a t to grow, as they could
well stand ; insomuch that I believe might set in near twenty
thousand of them, leavingla pretty large space between them
and my wall, that I might ave room to see an enemy, and they
might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer wall.

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five
or six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling grown
so monstrous thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly im-
passable ; and no man, of what kind soever, would ever imagine
that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As
for the way which I proposed to myself to go in or out (for I
left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to
place another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were
taken down, no man living could come down to me without
mischiefing himself; and .if they had come down, they were
still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human rudence could suggest
for my own preservation ; and it will Es seen, at len th, that
the were not altogether withoutjust reason ; though foresaw
not ing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doin , I was not altogether careless of my
other afiairs ; for I ha a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a present supply to me up-
on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without
the expense of powder an shot, but also abated the fatigue of
m hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the
a vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over
a am.

gFor this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of
but two ways to preserve them : one was to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night ; and the other was to inclose two or three
little bits of land, remote one frbm one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young oats in each place ; so that if any disaster happened to
the doc in general, I might be able to raise them agam with a
little trouble and time: and this, though it would require a
good deal of time and labor, Ithought was the most rational
design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island ; and I pitched upon one which was as pri-
vate indeed as my heart could wish ; it was a little damp was
of ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, w rere,
as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavor-
ing to come back that way from the eastern part of the island.
Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so sur-
rounded with woods, that it was almost an inelosure by
Nature; at least, it did not want near so much labor to make
it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground;
and, in less than a month's time, I had so fenced it round that
my flock, or herd, call it which you please, which were not so
wrld now as at first they might be su posed to be, were well
enough secured in it. So, without any urther dela , I removed
ten she-goats, and two lie-goats, to t nis piece; an , when the
were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it
as secure as the other 3 which, however I did at more leisure,
and it took me u more time by a great deal.

All this labor was at the expense of, purely from my ap-
prehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot which

had seen: for, as yet, I had never seen an human creature
come near the island; and I had now live two years under
this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfort-
able than it was before, as may well be imagined b any who
know what it is to live in the constant snare of t 1e fear of
man. And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the dis-
composure of my mind had too great inqn-essions also upon the
religious part of my thoughts ; for the dread and terror of fall-Tm: Foownux'r ox THE Sam--Page 1:56.
in into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my
spirits that I seldom found myself in a due temper for applica-
tion to my Maker ; at least, not with the sedate calmness and
resignation of soul which I was wont to do ; I rather prayed to
God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded
with danger, and in expectation even night of being murdered
and devoured before morning ; and must testify, from my ex-
perience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love and aflec-
tion, is much the more proper frame for rayer than that of
terror and discomposure ; and that under t e dread of mischief
impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of
the duty of praying to God than he is for repentance on a sick
bed ; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the others do
the body : and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily
be as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater;
praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the

o .

Blit to go on : after I had thus secured one art of my little
living stock, I went about the whole islan , searching for
another private place to make such another deposit ; when,
wandering more to the west point of the island than I had ever
done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a' boat upon
the sea, at a great distance. I had found aperspective lass
or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved out 0 our
ship, but I had it not about me ; and this was so remote that
I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till
my eyes were not able to hold to look any lonoer: whether it
was a boat or not, I do not know; but as Idescended from
the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I re-
solvlfd to go no more out without a perspective glass in my

oc et.

p When I was come down the hill to the end of the island,
where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such
a strange thing in the island as I imagined ; and, but that it
was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of the
island where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more fre uent than for the canoes
from the main, when they happene to be a little too far out
at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbor:
likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to
this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being
all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ;of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above,
being the S.W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded
and amazed ; nor it is possible for me to ex ress the horror of
my mind, at seein the shore spread with s ulls, hands, feet,
and other bones 0 human bodies ; and particularly, I observed
a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in
the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches
had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of
their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things that I
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a
long while : all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of
the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of
often, yet I never had so near a view of before ; in short, I
turned away n1 face from the horrid spectacle ; m stomach

rew sick, and was just at the point 0 fainting, w en nature

ischarged the disorder from my stomach ; and having vomited
with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved,but could not
bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the hill again
with all the speed I could, and walked on towar 3 my own hab-
itation.

When I came alittle out of that part ofthe island, I stood
still awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up
with the utmost afi'ection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears
in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a art
of the worl where I was distinguished from such drea ful
creatures as these ; and that, though I had esteemed my pres-
ent condition very miserable, had yet given me so many com-
forts in it that I had still more to ive thanks for than to com-
plain of z and this, above all, that had, even in this miserable
condition, been comforted with the knowledge of himself, and
the hope of his blessing: which was afelicit more than suffi-
ciently e uivalent to all the misery which had suffered, or
could su er.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of m circum-
stances than ever I was before : for I observed t at these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
get; erhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any~
thin ere ; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered,
woo y part of it, without finding anything to their purpose.
I knew had been here almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of human creature there before ; and I might
be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was now, If I
did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of 00-
casion to do ; it being my only business to keep myself entirely
concealed where I was, unless I found abetter sort of creatures
than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet I entertained
such an abhorrence of the save e wretches that I have been
speaking of, and of the wretche inhuman custom of their de-
vourin and eating one another up, that I continued pensive
and sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two
years after this : when I say my own circle, I mean by it my
three plantations,viz., my castle, my country-seat'(which I called
my bower), and my inclosure in the woods : nor did I look after
this for any other use than as an inclosure for my cats ; for
the aversion which nature gave me to these hellis wretches
was such that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the
devil himself, nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in
all this time, but began rather to think of making me another;
for I could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring
the other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with
some of those creature's at sea ; in which case, ifI had happened
to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been
In lot.

yI'ime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them ; and I began to live just in the
same com sed manner as before, only with this difference,
that I use more caution, and kept my eyes more about me
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them ; and particularly, I was more cautious in firing my gun,
lest any of t em, being on the island, should happen to hear it;
and it was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I had
furnished myself with a tame breed of oats, and that I had
no need to hunt any more about the woo s, or shoot at them ;
and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before : so that for two ears after this,
I believe I never fired my gun once 03, thong I never went
out without it; and which was more, as I had saved three
pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or
at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I
likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had
out of the ship, and made me a belt to put it on also ; so that
I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the
particular of two istols, and a great broadsword hanging at
my side in a belt, ut without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time I seemed,
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm
sedate way of living. All these things tended to show me,
more and more, how ar my condition was from being miserable,
compared to some others; nay to many other particulars of
life, which it might have pleased God to have made my lot.
It put me u on reflecting how little repining there would be
among man ind at any condition of life, if people would rather
compare their condition with those that are worse, in order to
be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which
are better, to assist their murmuriiigs and complainin s.

As in my present condition- there were not real y many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights
I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I
had been in for my own preservation, had taken 01f the edge
of my invention for mly own conveniences ; and I had dropped
a good design, which had once bent my thoughts u on, and
that was to try if I could not make some of my bar ey into
malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. T iis was really
a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the sim-
plicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want of
several things necessary to the making my beer, that it would
be impossible for me to supply ; as, first, casks to preserve it
in, which wasathing that, as have observed already, I could
never compass ; no, though I spent not many days, but weeks,
nay months, in attemptiniit, but to no purpose. In the next
place, I had no hops to ma e it keep, no yeast to make it work,
no copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet had not all these
things intervened--I mean, the frights and terrors I was in
about the savages--I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought
it to pass, too ; for I seldom gave anything over without ac-
complishing it, when I once had it in my head euougli to begin
it. But my invention now ran quite another way ; for, night
and da , I could think of nothing but how I might destroy
some 0 these monsters in their cruel, blood entertainment ;
and, if possible, save the victim they slioul bring hither to
destro . It would take up a lar er volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set own all the oontrivances I
hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the de-
stroying these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to
prevent their coming hither any more : but all was abortive ;
nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it myself ; and what could one man do among them,
when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together
with their darts, or their bows and arrows, With which they
could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun ?

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gun-
powder, which, when they kindled their fire, would conse-

uently take fire, and blow up all that was near it: but as, in
t e first place, I should be unwilling to waste so much powder
upon them, my store being now within the uantity of one
barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going 0 at any certain
time, when it might surprise them and, at best, that it would
do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright
them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place : so I
laid it aside; and then proposed that I would place myself in
ambush in some convenient place with mg three guns all double
loaded, and in the middle of their bloo y ceremony let fly at
them. when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or
three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my
three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there
were twenty, I should kill them all. This fancy leased my
thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it t rat I often
dreamed of it, and sometimes, that I was just going to let fly
at them in my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination,
that I emplo ed myself several days to find out roper places
to put mysel in ambuscade, as I said, to watch or them, and
I went frequently to the place itself, which was now rown
more familiar to me ; but while my mind was thus fille with
thoughts of revenge and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty
of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the
place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring
one another, abetted my malice. Well, at length I found a
place in the side of the hill, where I was satisfied I might se-
curely wait till Isaw any of their boats coming ; and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey
myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which there
was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and there I
mi ht sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my
ful aim at their heads when they were so close together as
that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot,
or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first
shot. In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design ; and ac-
cordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-
piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each,
and four or five smaller bullets, about the size of istol bullets ;
and the fowling-piece I loaded with near a han ful of swan-
shot of the largest size; I also loaded in pistols with about
four bullets each ; and in this posture, we?! provided with am-
munition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for
my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my
imagination at it in practice, I continually made my tour every
morning to t 1e top of the hill, which was from my castle, as
I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over
towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard duty, afterI had for
two or three months constantly kept my watch, but came al-
ways back without any discovery ; there having not, in all that
time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore,
but on the whole ocean, as far as my eyes or glass could reach
every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so
long also I ke t up the vigor of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be a l the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous
an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for
an ofiense which I had not at all entered into a. discussion of in
my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first fired by
the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people
of that country ; who, it seems, had been suffered by Provi~
dence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other
guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions;
and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had been so for some
ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful cus-
toms, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven,
and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of
the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far
every morning in vain, so my 0 irrion of the action itself began
to alter ; and began, with coo er and calmer thoughts, to con-
.sider what I was going to engage in ; what authority or call I
had to retend to be jud e and executioner upon these men as
crimina s, whom Heaven ad thought fit, for so man ages, to
suffer, an unished, to go on, and to be, as it were, t e execu-
tioners 0 his judgments, one upon another ; how far these
people were offenders against me, and what ri ht I had to en-
gage in the quarrel of that blood which they she promiscuously
upon one another. I debated this very often with myself
thus : "How do I know what God himself judges in this par-
ticular case ? It is certain these people do not commit this as a
crime ; it is not against their own conscience reproving, or
their light reproaching them ; they do not know it to be an of--
fense, and then commit it in defiance of Divine justice, as we
do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no morea
crime to kill acaptive taken in war than we do to kill an ox ;
or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton."
When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that
I was certainly in the wron in it; that these peo 1e were not
murderers, in the sense that had before condemne them in my
thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle ; or more fre-
quently, u on many occasions, put whole troops of men to the
sword, wit out giving uarter, though they threw down their
arms and submitted. n the next place, it occurred to me, that
albeit the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing to me. These people had done
me no injury ; that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary,
for my immediate preservation, to fall upon them, something
might be said for it: but that I was yet out of their power,
and they really had no knowledge of me, and consequently no
design upon me ; and, therefore, it could not be just for me
to fall u on them. That this would justify the conduct of the
Spaniard; in all their barbarities practiced in America, where
they destroyed millions of these peo le; who, however they
were idolators and barbarians, and ha several bloody and bar-
barous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies
to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people;
and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with
the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards
themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian nations in
Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural iece of
cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and suc as for
which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful
and terrible to all people of humanity or of Christian compas-
sion ; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for
the rodu'ct of a race of men who were without principles of
ten erness, or the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which
is reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a ause, and to a kind
of a full stop : and I be an, by little andp little, to be 03 my
design, and to conclude had taken wrong measures in in
resolution to attack the savages ; and that it was not my bus1~
ness to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me ; and
this it was my business, if possible, to prevent ; but that, if I
were discovered and attacked by them, then I knew my duty.
0n the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was
the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy
myself ; for, unless I was sure to kill ever one that not only
should be on shore at that time, but that s ould ever come on
shore afterwards, if but One of them esca ed to tell their coun-
try-people what had happened, they wo d come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should
only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at present,
I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded
that I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one way or
other, to concern myself in this afiair; that my business was,
by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, and
not to leave the least sign for them to uess by that there
were angiving creatures upon the islan --I mean of human
shape. ligion joined in with- this prudential resolution ;
and I was convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out
of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the
destruction of innocent creatures--I mean innocent as to me.
As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had
nothing to do with them ; these were national punishments, to
make a just retribution for national ofl'enses, and to bring pub-
lic 'udgment upon those who offend in a public manner, by
suc ways as best please God. This appeared soclear to me
now, that nothing was agreater satisfaction to me than that I
had not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much rea-
son to believe would have been noless a sin than that of willful
murder, if I had committed it ; and I gave most humble thanks,
on my knees, to God, that he had thus delivered me from blood-
guiltmess ; beseeching him to grant me the protection of his
providence, that I might not fall into the hands of the barbari-
ans, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had
a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defense of my own
life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this;
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling u on these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up t e hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or toknow whether
any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might not
be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or
be provoked by any advantage that might present itself, to fall
11 on them : on] this I did ; I went and removed my boat,
w rich I had on t e other side of the island, and carried it down
to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little
cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew,
by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would
not, come with their boats upon any account whatever. With
my boat I carried away everything thatI had left there belong-
ing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, viz.,
a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an
anchor, but which indeed could not be called either anchor or
grapnel ; however, it was the best I could make of its kind :
all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow
for discovery, or any ap earance of any boat, or of any habi-
tation upon the island. esides this, I kept myself, as I said,
more retired than ever, and seldom went from m cell, except
upon my constant em loyment, viz., to milk my 5 e-goats, and
manage my little lion in the wood, which, as it was quite on
the other part of the island, was out of danger; for certain it
is that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any thoughts of findin anything here, and
consequently never wandered off from t e coast, and I doubt
not but they mi ht have been several times on shore after my
apprehensions 0 them had made me cautious, as well as before.
In eed, I looked back with some horror u on the thou hts of
what my condition would have been, if had choppe upon
them and been discovered before that ; when, naked, and un-
armed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with
small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the
island to see what I could get ; what a surprise should I have
been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had in-
stead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them
pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their running, no possi-

ility of my escaping them ! The thoughts of this sometimes
sunk myvery soul Within me, and distressed my mind so much
that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have
done, and how I should not only have been unable to resist
them, but even should not have had resence of mind enough
to do what I might have done ; muc less what now, after so
much consideration and preparation, I might be able to do.
Indeed, after serious thinking of these things I would be ve
melancholy, and sometimes, it would last a great while : but
resolved it all, at last, into thankfulness to that Providence
which had delivered me from so man unseen dangers, and had
kept me from those mischiefs which could have no way been
the agent in delivering myself from, because I had not the least
notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposmon of
its being possible.

This renewed a contemplation which often had come into
my thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the
merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through
in this life ; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know
nothing of it ;'how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it),
a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that way, a
secret hint shall direct us this way when we intended to go that
way : nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps busi-
ness, has called us to go the other way, yet a strange impres-
sion upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by
we know not what ower, shall overrule us to go this way;
and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that way which
we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought to
have gone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these,
and many like reflections,I afterwards made it a certain rule
with me, that_wheneverI found those secret hints or pressings
of mind, to doing or not doing anythin that presented, or go-
ing this way or that way, I never faile to obe the secret dic-
tate ; though I knew no other reason for it t an that such a
pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my mind. I could give
many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of
my life, but more especiall in the latter part of my inhabiting
this unhappy island; besi es many occasions which it is very
likely I might have taken notice of if I had seen with the same
eyes then that I see with now. But it is never too late to be
wise ; and I cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even
though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret intima-
tions of Providence, let them come from what invisible intel-
ligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot
account for ; but certainly they are a proof of the converse of
spirits, and a secret communication between those embodied
and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never be with-
stood ; of which I shall have occasion to give some ve re-
markable instances in the remainder of my solitary resi ence
in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in,
and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all in-
vention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my fu-
ture accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of
my safety more now upon hands than that of my'food. I
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear
the noise I should make should be heard ; much less would I
fire a gun for the same reason ; and, above all, I was intoler-
ably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible
at a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this
reason, I removed that part of my business which required
fire, such as buming of ots and pipes, etc., into my new apart-
ment in the woods: where, after I had been some time, I
found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in
the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare sa ,
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so har y
as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant
reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was
cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;
and before I go on I must observe the reason of my making
this charcoal, which was thus : I was afraid of making a
smoke about my habitation, as I said before ; and yet I could
not live there without baking my bread, cooking my meat,
etc.; so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England, under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal ;
and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry
home and perform the other services for which fire was want-
in , without danger of smoke. But this is by the bye.
"gliile I was cuttin down some wood here, I perceived that,
behind a very thic branch of low brushwood or underwood,
there was a kind of hollow place : I was curious to look in it ;
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was
pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright
in it, and erhaps another with me : but I must confess to you
that I ma e more haste out than I did in, when looking farther
into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad
shining eyes of some creature--whether devil or man I knew
not--which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the
cave's mouth shining direct] in, and makin the reflection.
However, after some ause, recovered myse ,and began to
call myself a thousan fools, and to think that he that was
afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in a
island all alone ; and that I might well think there was noth-
ing in this cave that was more fri htful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I too up a firebrand, and m I
rushed again, With the stick flaming in my hand : I had not
gone three ste s in, before I was almost as much frightened
as before ; ford heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in
some pain, and it was followed-by a broken noise, as of words
half expressed, and then a dee sigh again. I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with sue a surprise that it ut me into
a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my hea , I will not
answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off. But
still plucking up my 3 irits as well as I could, and encourag-
ing myself a little wit considering that the power and pres-
ence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I
stepped forward again, and by the dim light of the firebrand,
holding it up a little over my head, I saw 1 ing on the ground
a monstrous, frightful old lie- oat, just ma ing his will, as we
say, and gasping for life, and ying indeed of mere old a e. I
stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and e es-
sayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself ; and I
thought With myself he might even lie there ; for if he had
frightened me, so he would certainly fri ht any of the savages,
if any one of them should be so har y as to come in there
while he had any life in him. .

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was but very small, that is
to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner
of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having ever been
employed in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed
also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went
in farther, but was so low that it required me to cree upon
my hands and knees to 0 into it, and whither it went knew
not ; so, having no caud e, I gave it over for that time, but re-
solved to come again the next day provided with candles and
a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles
now of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using
sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of
a weed like nettles) ; and going into this low place I was ob-
liged to creep upon all-fours, as I have said, almost ten yards
-----which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough,
considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what
was beyond it. When I had got through the strait, I found
the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet 3 but never
was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it
was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave;
the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my
two candles. What it was in the rock--whether diamonds, or
any other precious stones, or gold--which I rather supposed it
to be--I knew not. The place I was in was a most delightful
cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry
and level, andhad a sort of a'small loose gravel upon it, so that
there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof ; the. only difli-
eulty in it was the entrance--which, however, as it was a place
of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought was :i
convenience--so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and
resolved,without any delay, to bring some of those things which
I was most anxious about to this place ! particularly, I re-
solved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my
spare arms ; viz., two fowling-pieces--for I had three in all--
and three muskets~for of them I had eight in all ; so I kept
in my castle only five, which stood ready mounted like pieces
of cannon on my outmost defense, and were ready also to take
out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing
my ammunition, I ha pened to open the barrel of powder
which I took 11 out o the sea, and which had been wet, and
I found that t e water had penetrated about three or four
inches into the powder on every side, which caking and grow-
ing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell, so
that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the cen--
ter of the cask; and this was a very agreeable discovery to
me at that time ; so I carried all away thither, never keeping
above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle,
for fear of a surprise of any kind ; I also carried thither all
the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them ; for I persuaded myself, while I was
here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could
never find me out--or if they did, they would not venture to
attack me here. The old goat whom I found expiring died in
the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this dis-
covery ; and I found it much easier to dig a great hole there,
and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him
out; so I interred him there, to prevent ofiense to my nose.

I was now in the twenty-third year of residence in this island,
and was so naturalized to the place and the manner of living,
that, could I but have en'oyed the certainty that no savages
would come to the place to isturb me, I could lave been content
to have capitulated for s ending the rest of my time there, even
to the last moment, uni had laid me down and died, like the
old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions
and amusements, which made the time Ease more pleasantly
with me a great deal than it did before ; rst, I had taught my
Poll, as I noted before, to speak ; and he did it so familiarly,
and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant
to me, and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years.
How Iona he might have lived afterwards I know not, though
I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hun-
dred years. Perhaps some of my Polls may be alive there
still, calling after poor Robinson Crusoe to this day; I wish
no Englishman the ill-luck to come there and hear them ; but if
he did he would certainly believe it was the devil. My dog was
a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen
years of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my
cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that
I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them
from devouring me and all I had; but, at length, when the old
ones I brou ht with me were gone, and after some time con-
tinually drivmg them from me, and letting them have no pro-
vision with me, the all ran wild into the woods, except two
or three favorites, w 'ch I kept tame, and whose young, when
they had any, I always drowned ; and these were part of my
family. Besides these I always kept two or three household
kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand ; and I had
two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call
" Robin Crusoe," but none like my first ; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I
had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew not, that
I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings ; and the little
stakes which I had planted before my castle-wall being now
grown up to a good thick rove, these fowls all lived among
these low trees, and bred t Jere, which was very agreeable to
me ; so that, as I said above, Ibegan to be ver well contented
with the life I led, if I could have been secure from the dread
of the savages. But it was otherwise directed ; and it may
not be amiss for all people who shall meet with m story to make
this just observation from it ;viz., how frequent y, in the course
of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun,and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is
oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which
alone we can be raised again from the afiiiction we are fallen
into. I could give many examples of this in the course of my
unaccountable ife, but In nothing was it more particularly re-
markable than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary
residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when,
' oing out pretty early in the 'morning, even before it was
thorough daylig t, I was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles
towards the end of the island where I had observed some
savages had been, as before, and not on the other side, but, to
my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be
surprised ; and et I had no more peace within, from the appre-
hensions I had t at if these savages, in rambling over the island,
should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and
improvements, they would immediately conclude that there
were people in the place, and would then never rest till they had
found me out. In this extremity I went back directly to my
castle, pulled up the ladder after me, having made all things
without look as wild and natural as I could.

Then} pre ared myself within, putting myself in a posture
of defense; loaded all my cannon, as I called them--that is
to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new forti-
fication, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the last gasp--not forgetting seriously to commend myself to
the Divine rotection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
me out of t ie hands of the barbarians. And in this posture I
continued about two hours, and began to be impatient for
intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sit-
ting a while longer and musing what I should do in this case,
I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer ; so set~
ting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a
flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill,
and pullin out my perspective-glass, which I had taken on
purpose, IIaid me down flat ou_my belly on the ground, and

egan to look for the place. I presently found there were no
less than-nine naked savages Sitting round a small fire they
had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress
some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had
brought with them, whether alive or dead I could not know.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed
to me to wait the return of the flood to go away again. It is
not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, es-
pecially seeing t iem come on m side of the island, and so near
me, too; but when I consider-e their coming must be always
with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more
sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with
safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not on
shore before ; and having made this observation, I went abroad
about my harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made
to the westward, I saw. them all take boat and row (or paddle,
as we call it) away. I should have observed, that for an hour
or morabefore they went 0E they were dancin , and I could
easily discern their postures and gestures by my gfiass. I could
not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were
stark naked, and had not the least covering it on them ; but
whether they were men or women I could not istinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great
sword b my side, without a scabbard, and with all the speed
I was able to make went away to the hill where I had discovered
the first appearance of all ; and as soon as I got thither, which
was not less than two hours for I could not go apace, being
so loaded with arms as I was), perceived there had been three
canoes more of savages at that lace; and, lookintr out farther
I saw they were all at sea toget er, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, going down
to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal
work they had been about had left behind it, viz., the blood,
the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and de-
voured by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was
so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to pre-
meditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them
be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that
the visits which they made thus to this island were not very
frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of
them came on shore there again--that is to say, I neither saw
them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all that time ; for
as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad,
at least not so far: yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming upon
me by surprise--from whence I observe that the expectation
of evil is more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is
no room to shake off that expectation or those ap rehensions

During all this time I was in the murdering umor, and
3 cut most of my hours, which should have been better em-
p oyed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them
the very next time I should see them--especially if they should
be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties ; nor
did I consider at all that if I killed one party--suppose ten or
a dozen--I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I should be, at
length, no less a. murderer than they were in being man-
eaters--and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in
great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should
one day or other fall into the hands of these merciless crea-
tures 3 and if I did at' any time venture abroad, it was not with-
out looking around me with the greatest care and caution im-
aginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy
it was that I had provided a tame flock, or herd, of goats ; for
I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that
side of the island where they usually came, lest I should
alarm the savages ; and if they had fled from me now, I was
sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three hun-
dred canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew what
to expect. However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found
them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might
have been there once or twice, but either they made no stay,
or at least I did not hear them ; but, in the month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year,
I had a very strange encounter with them; of which in its
lace.
p The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months interval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed
always frightful dreams, an often started out of my sleep in
the night. - In the day, great troubles overwhelmed my mind ;
and in the night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, and
of the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But to
waive all this for a while. It was in the middle of May, on
the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calender
would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it
was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm
of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder,
and a very foul night it was after it. I knew not what was
the particular occasion of it; but as I was reading the Bible,
and taken up with very serious thoughts about in present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as thought,
fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before ; for the notions this
put into my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started
up in the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clap ed
my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it a ter
me ; and, mounting it the second time, got to the top of the
hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen fora
second gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard ;
and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea
where I was driven out with the current in my boat. I im-
mediatelyeconsidered that this must be some ship in distress,
and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in com-
any, and fired these for si nals of distress, and to obtain help.
had the presence of mind, at that minute, to think: that
though I could not help them, it might be they might help
me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at
hand, and, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon
the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely ; and though
the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out, so that I was
certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must need
see it, and no doubt they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed
up, I heard another an, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. slied my fire all night long, till daybreak ;
and when it was bro'a day, and the air cleared up, I saw some-
thin at a great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether
a sai or a hull I could not distinguish--no, not with my glass;
the distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy
also--at least, it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that
it did not move ; so I presently concluded that it was a ship
at anchor ; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied,
I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of
the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been carried away
with the current; and getting up there, the weather by this
time being perfect] clear, I could plainly see, to my great
sorrow, the wreck o a ship, east awa in the night upon those
concealed rocks which I found when "was outin my boat ; and
which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and
made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of
my recovering from the most des erate, hopeless condition that
ever I had been in in all my 1i e. Thus, what is one man's
safety is another man's destruction ; for it seems these men,
whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven u on them in the
night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E. .E. Had they
seen the island, as I must necessarily sup ose they did not, they
must, as I thought, have endeavored to have saved themselves
on shore by the help of their boat ; but their firing 01? their
guns for help, especially when they'saw, as I imagined, my tire,

lled me With many thoughts. irst, I imagined that upon
seeing my light, they might have put themselves into their
boat, and endeavored to make the shore ; but that the sea run-
ning very high, they might have been cast away. Other times,
I imagined t at they might have lost their boat before, as might
be the case many ways ; as particularly, by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to stave, or
take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard
with their own hands. Other times, I imagined they had some
other ship orships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they made, had taken them up and carried them 03. Other
times, I fancied the were all gone OK to sea in their boat, and
being carried away y the current that I had been formerly in,
were carried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing
but misery and perishing ; and that, perhaps, they might by
this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat
one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition
I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of
the poor men, and pity them ; which had still this good effect
upon my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give
thanks to God, who ha so happily and comfortably provided
for me in my desolate condition ; and that of two ships' com-
panies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here again
to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts
us into any condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but
we may see something or other to be thankful for, and may see
others in worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly
was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see
room to suppose any of them were saved ; nothing could make
it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all
perish there, except the possibility only of their being taken
up) by another ship in company ; and this was but mere pos-
si ility indeed, for I saw not the least signal or appearance of
any such thing. I cannot expilain, by any possible energy of
words, \vhata strange longing felt in my soul upon this si ht,
breaking out sometimes thus : " Oh, that there had been at
one or two, nay, or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to have
escaped to me, that I might but have one com anion, one fel-
low-creature, to have spoken to me and to ave eonversed
with 1" In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so
earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my fellow-crea-
tures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.

There are some secret moving sprin s in the affections, which,
when they are set a-going by some 0 ject in view, or, though
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of
imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity,
to such violent, ea er embracings of the object, that the absence
of it is insupporta le. Such were these earnest wishiugs that
but one man had been saved. I believe I repeated the words,
"Oh, that it had been but one l" a thousand times; and my
desires were so moved by it that when I spoke the words my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers would press the
palms of my hands, so that if I had had any soft thing in my
hand, I would have crushed it involuntarily ; and my teeth in
my head would strike together, and set against one another so
strong, that for some time I could not part them again. Let
the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner
of them. All I can say of them is to describe the fact, which
was even surprising to me, when I found it, thou h I knew
not from what it should proceed ; it was, doubtless, t 1e efiect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realiz-
ing the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-
Christians would have been to me. But it was not to be ; either
their fate, or mine, or both, forbade it, for till the last year of
my being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship or no ; and had only the afliiction, some da s
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the
end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had no
clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat,a pair of open-knead linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; nothing to direct me so much
as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pock-
ets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe--the last was
to me of ten times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something
on board that might be useful to me. But that did not alto-
gether press me so much as the possibility that there might be
yet someliving creature on board, whose life I might not only
save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last
degree ; and this thought clung so to my heart that I could not
be quiet night or day, but I must. venture out in my boat on
board this wreck ; and committing the rest to God's providence,
I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it
could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible di-
rection, and that I should be wantingtom self if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I rastened back to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a reat pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle
of rum for I had still a great deal of that left), and a basket
of raisins ; and thus loading myself with everything necessary,
I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, got her
afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more. My second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the
umbrella to setpp over my head for a shade, another large pot
full of fresh water, and about two dozen of small loaves, or
barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's-milk,
and a cheese ; all which, with great labor and sweat,I brought
to my boat ; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out,
and, rowing or paddlin the canoe along the shore, came at last
to the utmost point of t e island on the northeast side. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or
not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
stantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which
were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard
I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for I
foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I
should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of
my reach, or sight of the island again ; and that then, as my
boat was but small if any little gale of wind should rise, I should
be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed m mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise; and having )auled my boat into a little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat down upon a rising
bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and de-
sire about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could per-
ceive that the tide was turned, and the flood came on ; upon
which, my going was impracticable for so man hours. Upon
this, presently it occurred to me that I shonl go 11 to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if could,
how the sets of the tide, or currents lay, when the flood came
in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I
might not expect to be driven another way home, with the
same ra idity of the currents. This thought was no sooner in
my hea than I cast my eye upon a little bill, which sufficiently
overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear
view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was
to'guide myself in my return. Here I found that as the cur-
rent of ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so
the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north
side ; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north
of the island in my return, and I should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next
morning, to set out with the first of the tide; and re osing
myself for the night in my canoe, under the great watc -coat
I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a little out to sea,
full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which
set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate ; and yet
(lid not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done
before, so as to take from me all government of the boat ; but
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, at a great
rate,d|rectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came
up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which,
by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between
two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her were beaten to
pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the
rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast and fore-
mast were brought by the board--that is to say, broken short
off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow ap-

eared firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon

er, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ; and, as soon
as I called him, jum ed into the sea to come to me. I took
him into the boat, ut found him almost dead with hunger
and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured
it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in
the snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water,
with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst him~
self. After this I went on board; but the first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle, of
the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded,
as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it bein in
a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over er,
that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with
the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had
been under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in
the ship that had life; nor any goods, that I could see, but
what were spoiled by the water. here were some casks of lig-
uor, whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in
the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see ;
but the were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests,
which believe belonged to some of the seamen; and I got
two of them into the boat, without examining what was in
them. Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart
broken ad, I am persuaded I might have made a g: od voyage;
for,b what I found in these two chests, Ihad room to su pose
the slip had a great deal of wealth on board ; and, if may
guess from the course she steered, she must have been bound
from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south art
of America, beyond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the ulf
of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a
great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody;
but what became of the crew I then knew not.

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much dif-
ficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a great
powder born, with about four pounds of powder in it; as for
the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but
took the powder-horn. I tooka fire-shovel and tongs, which I
wanted extremely 5 as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this cargo, and the
dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again ; and
the same evening, about an hour within ni ht, I reached the
island a ain, weary and fatigued to the last egree. I reposed
that nig t in the boat ; and in the morning I resolved to har-
bor what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my
castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore,
and began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I
found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the
Brazils; and, in a word, not at all good : but when I came to
open the chests, I found several things of great use to me ; for
example, I found in one afine case of bottles, of an extraordinary
kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and ver good ; the
bottles held about three pints each, and were tippe with silver.
I found two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fast-
ened also on the to that the salt water had not hurt them ;
and two more of tlie same, which the water had spoiled. I
found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me ;
and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and
colored neckcloths ; the former were also very welcome, being
exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides
this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found there three
great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred

ieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six

oubloons of gold, and some small bars or wed es of go (i ; I sup-
pose they minrht all weigh near a pound. n the other chest
were some cIothes, but of little value ; but, by the circum-
stances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate ; though
there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed
powder, in'three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their
fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little
by this voyage that was of any use to me ; for as to the money,
I had no manner of occasion for it : it was to me as the dirt
under my feet, and I would have given it all for three or four
pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things I greatly
wanted, but had none on my feet for many years. I had, indeed,

0t two air of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two

rowne men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair
more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me ;
but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or ser-
vice, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in
this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no
gold. I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other,
which seemed to belong to some oflicer. Well, however, I
lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had
done that before which I had brought from our own ship ; but
it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship
had not come to my share ; for I am satisfied I mi ht have
loaded my canoe several times over with money ; w ich, if I
had ever escaped to England, would have lain here safe enough
till I might have come again and fetched it.

Having now brought all my things on shore and secured
them, I went back to :11 boat, and rowed or paddled her along
the shore to her old har or where I laid her up, and made the
best of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything
safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my
old fashion, and take care of my family affairs ; and for a while
I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used
to be,l'ooked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much ;' and
if, at any time, I did stir with an freedom, it was always to
the east part of the island, where was pretty well satisfied the
savages never came, and where I could go without so man pre-
cautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I a ways
carried with me if I went the other way. I lived in this con-
dition near two years more; but my unlucky head, that was
always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable,
was all these two years filled with projects and desrgns, how,if
it were ossible, I might get away from this island ; for some-
time I was for making another voya e to the wreck, thou h
my reason told me that there was not ing left there worth tie
hazard of my voyage ; sometimes for a ramble one way, some-
times another ; and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that
I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound
anywhere, I knew not whither. I have been in all my circum-
stances, a memento to those who are touched with the general
plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their
miseries flow ; I mean that of not being satisfied with the
station wherein God and Nature hath laced them: for, not
to look back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent
advice of my father, the 0 position to which was, as I may call
it, my original sin, my su sequent mistakes of the same kind
had been the means of my coming into this miserable condition ;
for had that Providence, which-so happil seated me at the
Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, and I
could have been contented to have gone on gradually, Imight
have been by this time,I mean in the time of my bein in this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the razils;
nay,I am persuaded that by the improvements I had made
in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should prob-
ably have made if I had remained, I might have been worth a
hundred thousand moidores : and what business had I to leave
a settled fortune, a well-stocked lantation, improving and in-
creasing, to turn supercargo to uinea to fetch negroes, when
patience and time would have so increased our stock at home,
that we could have bought them at our own door from those
whose business it was to fetch them? and though it had cost
us something more, yet the difference of that price was by no
means worth saving at so great a hazard. But as this is ordi-
narily the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the folly of it
is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought
experience of time ; so it was with me now ; and et so deep
had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I can] not satisfy
myself in m station, but was continually oring upon the means
and possibi ity of my escape from this iiace ; and that I may,
with the greater pleasure to the reader, ring on the remaining
part of my story, it may not be improper to give some account
of my first conceptions on the subiect of this foolish scheme for
my escape, and how, and upon w lat foundation, I acted.

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late
voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under
water, as usual, and my condition restored to what it was be-
fore. I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer ; for I had no more use for it than the In-
dians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island
of solitude. I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very
well in health, had no am, no distemper, no uneasiness of body
nor any uneasiness otP mind more than ordinary, but could b
no means'close my eyes, that is so as to sleep ; no, not a win
all night long, otherwise than as follows : It is impossible and
needless to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that
whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain--the
memory--in this night's time. I ran over the whole history of
my life in miniature, or b abridgment, as I may call it, to my
coming to this island, an also of that part of my life since I
came to this island. In my reflections upon the state of my
case since I came on shore on this island, I was comparing the
happy posture of m afiairs in the first years of m abitation
here, With the life ofy anxiety, fear, and care which had lived in
ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand ; not that I
did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the
while, and might havebeen several hundreds of them at times
on shore there, but I had never known it, and was incapable
of any apprehensions about it; my satisfaction was perfect,
though my danger was the same, and I was as happy in not
knowing my danger as if I had never really been exposed to it.
This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable reflec-
tions, and particularly this one : How infinitely good that rov-
idence is which has provided, in its government of man ind,
such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things;
and though he walks in the mi st of so many thousand dangers,
the sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract his
mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having
the events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing
of the dangers which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I
came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for
so many years in this very island, and how I had walked
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquil-
lity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill,a great
tree, or the casual . pproach of night, had been between me
and the worst kind 0 destruction, viz., that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me
with the same view as I would on a goat or a turtle ; and have
thought it'no more crime to kill and devour me than I did of
a pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, if I
shou (1 say I was not sincerely thankful to my great reserver,
to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with great hu-
milit , all these unknown deliverances were due, and without
whic I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless
hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched crea-
tures, I mean the savages, and how it came to pass, in the world,
that the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his
creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so much be-
low even brutality itself, as to devour its own kind ; but as this
ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred
to me to inquire, what part of the world these wretches lived
in? how far off the coast was from whence they came? what
they ventured over so far from home for ? what kind of boats
they had ? and why I might not order myself and my busi-
ness so, that I might be as able to go overt ithcr,as they were
to come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I went thither; what would be-
come of me if I fell into the hands of these savages ; or how
I should escape them if they attacked me ; no, nor so much as
how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be at-
tacked by some or other of them, without any possibility of
delivering myself: and if I should not fall into their hands,
what I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my
course ; none of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in
my way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of
my passing over in my boat to the mainlan . I looked upon
my present condition as the most miserable that could pos-
sibly be ; that I was not able to throw myself into anything
but death, that could be called worse; and if I reached the
shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I
might coast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came
to some inhabited country, and where I might find some re-
lief ; and, after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian
ship that might take me in; and if the worst came to the
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these
miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a dis-
turbed mind, an impatient temper, made, as it were, desperate
by the long continuance of my troubles, and the disappoint-
ments I had met with in the wreck I had been on board of,
and where I had been so near the obtaining what I so earn-
estly longed for, namely, somebody to speak to, and to learn
some knowledge of the place where I was, and of the robable
means of my deliverance. I sayI was agitated w olly by
these thoughts; all my calm of mind, in my resignation to
Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of
Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were, no
power to turn my thoughts to anything but the project of a
voyage to the main, which came upon me with such force,
and guch an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be re-
sists .

When this had a itated my thoughts for two hours or more,
with such violence t at it set my very blood into a ferment, and
my pulse heat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extra-
ordinary fervor of my mind about it, Nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of it, threw me
into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should have
dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to it ; but
I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning, as usual,
from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven
savages, coming to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in order to eat
him ; when, on a sudden, the savage t at the were going to
kill jumped away, and ran for his life ; then thou ht, in my
sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove efore my
fortification, to hide himself 3 and that I, seeing him alone, and
not perceiving that the others sought him that wa , showed
myself to him, and, smiling upon him, encouraged im; that
he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him;
upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up it, and
carried him into my cave, and he became my servant ; and
that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, " Now I
may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve
me as apilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for
provisions, and whither not to go for fear of bein devoured ;
what laces to venture into and what to escape." waked with
this t ought ; and was under such inexpressible impressions
of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the dis-
appomtments which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding
that it was no more than a dream, were equally extravagant the
other way, and threw me into a ood dejection of spirits.
Upon this, however, I made t is conclusion ; that my only
way to go about an attempt for an escape was, if possible, to get
a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be one
of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten, and
should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were at-
tended with this diflieulty, that it was impossible to effect this
without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them
all ; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had eatly scrupled the
lawfulness of it to me; and my heart trem led at the thoughts
of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance.
I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me a ainst
this, they being the same mentioned before; but-though had
other reasons to offer now--viz., that those men were enemies
to my life, and would devour me if they could ; that it was self-
preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from
this death of a life, and was acting in my own defense as much
as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say,
though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of sheddin
human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, an
such as I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great
while. However, at last, after many secret disputes with my-
self, and after great perplexities about it (for all these argu-
ments, one way and another, struggled in my head along time),
the eager prevailing desire of de iverance at length mastered
all the rest ; and I resolved, if possible, to et one of these
savages into my hands, cost what it would. y next thing was
to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to
resolve on; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for
it, 501 resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event ; taking such
measures as the opportunity should present, let be what would be.

With these resolutionsin my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily
tired of it ; for it was above a year and a half that I waited ;
and for a great part of that time went out to the west end, and
to the southwest corner of the island almost every day, to look
for canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging,
and began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that it did
in this case (as it had done some time before wear ofi the edge
of my desire to the thing ; but the longer it seemed to be de-
layed, the more eager I was for it ; in a word, I was not at first
so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being
seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides,
I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages,
if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do
whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their bein able
at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great while t at I
pleased myself with this affair; but nothin still presented ; all
my fancies and schemes came to nothing, or no savages came
near me for a great while.

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and
by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing,
for want of an occasion to put them in execution), I was sur-
prised one morning early by seeing no less than five canoes all
on shore together on my side the island, and the eople who
belonged to them all landed and out of my sight. be number
of them broke all my measures ; for seeing so many, and know-
ing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed ; so lay
still in my castle, erplexed and discomforte . However,I ut
myself into all t e same postures for an attack that I ad
formerly provided, and was just read for action, if anything
had presented. Having waited a good while, listenin to hear
if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, set my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of '
the hill, by my two stages, as usual ; standiu so, however, that
my head did not appear above the hill, so t at they could not
perceive me b any means. Here I observed, by the help of my
perspective g ass, that they were no less than thirty in number ;
that they had a fire kindled, and that the had meat dressed.
How they had cooked it, I knew not, or w rat it was ; but they
were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures
and figures, their own way, round the fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my per-
spective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where,
it seems, the were laid by, and were now brought out for the
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fall ; being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way ;and two or three others were at work im-
mediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other
victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready
for him. In that very moment, this oor wretch, seeing him-
self a little at liberty, and unbound, Igature inspired him with
hopes of life and he started away from them, and ran with in-
credible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me ; I mean
towards that part of the coast where m habitation was. I was
dreadfully frightened, that I must ac nowledge, when I per-
ceived him run my way ; and especially when, as I thou ht, I
saw him pursued by the whole body ; and now I expecteg that
part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would cer-
tainly take shelterin my grove ; but I could not de end, by any
means, u on my dream, that the other savages won d not pursue
him thit er, and find him there. However, I kept my station,
and my spirits began to recover when I found that there was
not above three men that followed him ; and still more was en-
couraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceeding] in
running, and gained ground on them ; so that, if he could at
hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away
from them all.

There was, between them and m castle, the creek, which I
mentioned often in the first part 0 my story, where I landed
my cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must
necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there ;
but when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing
of it, though the tide was then up ; but, lunging in, swam
through in about thirty strokes, or thereaiouts, landed, and
ran With exceeding stren th and swiftness. When the three

ersons came to the creek found that two of them could swim,

at the third could not, and that, standin on the other side,
'he looked at the others, but went no fart er, and soon after
went softly back again ; which, as it happened, was very well
for him in the end. I observed that the two who swam were
yet more than twice as long swimming over the creek than the
fellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon
my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to
get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant ; and
that I was plainly called by Providence to save this oor crea-
ture's life. Iimmediately ran down the ladder with a [possible

expedition, fetched m two guns, for they were both at the
foot of the ladder, as observed before, and getting up again
with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards
the sea ; and having a very short cut, and all down hill, clap'd
myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hal-
looing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first
perhaps as much frightened at me as at them ; but I beckoned
with my hand to him to come back ; and, in the mean time, I
slowly advanced towards the two that followed ; then rushin

at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stoc

of 111 piece. I was 10th to fire, because I would not have the
rest ear; thou h at that distance it would not have been
easil heard, an being out of sight of the smoke, too, they
won (1 not have known what to make of it. Having knocked
this fellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he
had been fri htened, and I advanced towards him; but as I
came nearer, perceived presently he had a bow and arrow,
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then obliged to
shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot.
The oor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both is enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so
frightened with the fire and noise of my piece that he stood
stock still, and neither came forward nor went Backward,
though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on.
I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which
he easily understood, and came a little way; then stopped
again, and then a little farther, and stopped again ; and I could
then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken
prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies
were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, and gave him all
the signs of encoura ement that I could think of ; and he came
nearer and nearer, neeling down every ten or twelve steps,
in token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still
nearer ; at length, he came close to me ; and then he'kneeled
down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the
ground, and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head ;
this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave forever.
I took him u , and made much of him, and encouraged him
all I could. gut there was more work to do yet; for I per-
ceived the savage whom I had knocked down was not killed,
but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself. So
I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he was not
dead; upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I
could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear ; for they were the first sound of a man's voice that I
had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years.
But there was no time for such reflections now; the savage
who was knocked down recovered himself so faras to sit up
u on the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be
a raid; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at
the man, as if I would shoot him ; upon this In savage, for so
I call him now, made a motion to me to lend im my sword,
which hung naked in a belt b my side, which I did. He no
sooner had it, but he runs to is enemy, and at one blow out
ofi his head as cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have
done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for
one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life
before, except their own wooden swords : however, it seems,
as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even
cut of heads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow
too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign
of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with abund-
ance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down, with
the head of the savage thathe had killed just before me. But
that which astonished him most, was to know how I killed the
other Indian so far 03 ; so pointing to him, he made signs to
me to let him go to him ; and I bade him go, as well as I could.
When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at
him, turning him first on one side, then on the other; looked
at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was just in
his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of
blood had followed ; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making
si us to him that more might come after them.

pon this he made signs to me that he should bury them
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if the fol-
lowed; and so I made s1 us to him again to do so. He ell to
work ; and in an instant e had scra ed a hole in the sand with
his hands, big enough to bury the rst in, and then dragged
him into it, and covered him ; and did so by the other also ; I
believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then
calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but uite
awa to my cave, on the farther part of the island; so did
not et my dream come to pass in that part, that he came into
my grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of
raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in great distress for from his running; and having re-Tn: Sums Manse A Smx or Suuulssxux.--l'uge 159.
freshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep,
showing him a place where I had laid some rice straw, and a
blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ;
so the poor creature 1a down, and went to sleep. .

He was a comely, andsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall and well shaped ;
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very
good countenance, nota fierce and surly as ect, but seemed to

ave something very manly in his face ; an yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of a European in his countenance, too,
especially when he smiled. His hair was long and black, not
curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a
great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The color
of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny ; and et not
an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and ir in-
ians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright kin of
a dun olive-color, that had in it something very agreeable,
though not very easy to describe. His face was round and
plum ; his nose sma I, not flat like the negroes; a ver good
mout , thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as w its as
No .

Xfyter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour,
he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for I had
been milking my goats, which I had in the inclosure just by :
when he espied me, he came runnin to me, laying himself
down again upon the ground, with a the possible signs of an
humble, thankful disposition, making a reat many antic ges-
tures to show it. At last he lays his head flat uponthe ground,
close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he
had done before ; and after this, made all the signs to me of
subjection, servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me
know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood
him in many things, and let him know I was ver well pleased
with him. In a little time I began to speak to him, and teach
him to speak to me ; and, first, I let him know his name should
be FRIDAY, which was the day I saved his life ; I called him so
for the memory of the time. Ilikewise taught him to say
Master, and then let him know that was to be my name ; I like-
wise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the meaning
of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him
see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it ; and gave
him a cake of bread to do the like, which he quick] complied
with, and made signs that it was very good forhim. kept there
with him all that night; but, as soon as it was day, I beckoned
to him to come with me, and let him know I would give him
some clothes ; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked. As we went- by the place where he had buried the two
men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks
that he had made to find them again, making Signs to me that
we should dig them up again and eat them. At this I ap-
peared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I
would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand
to him to come awa , which he did immediately, with great
submission. I then ed him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I looked, and
saw plainly the place where they had been, but no appearance
of them or their canoes; so that it was plain they were gone,
and had left their two comrades behind them, without any search
after them.

Buthas not content with this discovery ; but, having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man
Friday with me, givin him the sword in his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his bac , which I found he could use very dex-
terously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two for my-
self ; and away we marched to the place where these creatures
had been--for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence
of them. When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the
spectacle ; indeed, it was a dreadful sight ; at least it was so to
me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered
with human bones, the ground dyed with the blood, and great
pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and
scorched; and, in short,.all the tokens of the triumphant feast
they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies.
I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and
Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought over
four risoners to feast u on ; that three of them were eaten up
and t at he, pointing to imself, was the fourth; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next king, of whose
subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a
great number of risoners; all which were carried to several
places by those w 0 had taken them in the fight, in order to

east upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon those
they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and make
a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday
had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was
stilla cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor-
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of
it, that he durst not discover it--for I had, by some means, let
him know that I would kill him if he offered it.

When he had done this we came back to our castle, and
there I fell to work for my man Friday ; and, first of all, I gave
him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gun-
ner's c est I mentioned, whichI found in the wreck, and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well; and then I made
him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill would allow (for
I was now rown a tolerably good tailor) ; and I gave him 3.
ca which made of hare's skin, very convenient, and fashion-
ab e enough, and thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably
well, and was mighty well leased to see himself almost as
well clothed as his master. t is true, he went awkwardly in
these clothes at first; wearing the drawers was very awkward
to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and
the inside of his arms--but a little easin them where he com-
plained they hurt him, and using himselfto them, at length he
took to them very well.

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I
began to consider where I should lodge him ; and, that I
might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
made a little tent for him in the vacant lace between my two
fortifications, in the inside of the last, an in the outside of the
first. As there was a door or entrance there into 111 cave, I
made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it o boards,
and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance ; and,
causing the door to open in the inside, Ibarred it up in the
night, taking in my ladders, too; so that Frida could no way
come at me in the inside of my innermost wal , without mak-
ing so much noise in getting over that it must needs awaken
me ; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the
lill ; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead
of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the
rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or
place which was left to go in or out b the ladder, I had
placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it ha been attempted on
the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have
fallen down and made a great noise ; as to weapons, Itook
them all into my side every night. But I needed none of all
this precaution; for never man had a more faithful, loving,
sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions,
sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged ; his
very afiections were tied to me like those of a child to a
father; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for
saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever : the many testi-
monies he gaye me of this put it out of doubt, and soon con-
vinced me that I needed no precautions for my safety on his
account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God in his Providence,
and in the government of the works of his hands, to take from
so great a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the
same reason, the same affections ; the same sentiments of kind-
ness and obligation ; the same passions and resentments of
wrongs; the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all
the capacities of doing cod and receiving good, that he has
given to us ; and that w ien he pleases to ofl'er them occasions
of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply
them to the ri ht uses for which they were bestowed than we
are. This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting,
as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we make of
all these, even though we have these powers enlightened by
the great lamp of instruction, the spirit of God, and b the
knowledge of his word added to our understandin ; an why
it has pleased God to hide the like. saving knowle ge from so
many millions of souls, who, if I might 'udge by this oor sav-
age, would make a much better use of it than we di . From
hence, I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty
of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of so
arbitrary a dis osition of things, that should hide that sight
from some, an reveal it to others, and yet expect a little dut
from both ; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with
this conclusion: first, That we did not know. by what light
and law these should be condemned; but that as God was
necessarily, and, by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and
just, so it could not be; but if these creatures were all sen-
tenced to absence from himself, it was on account of sinning
against that light, which, as the Scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and b such rules as their conscience would ac-
knowledge to be Just, thou h the foundation was not discov-
ered to us ; and, secondlyfll'hat still, as we are all the cla in
the hand of the Potter, no vessel could say to him, "Why ast
thou formed me thus?"

But to return to my new companion : I was greatly delighted
with him, and made it m business to teach him eve thing
that was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpfu ; butCnusor: INSTRUCTS FRIDAY TO MAKE HIMSELF IIEI.PPUI..--Pnge163.
especially to make him speak, and understand me when I
spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever was ; and par-
ticularly was so merr , so constantly diligent, and so pleased
when he could but un erstand me, or make me understand him,
that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my
life began to be so easy that I began to say to myself, that could
I but have been safe from more sava es, I cared not if I was
never to remove from the place while lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle,
I thou ht that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid
way 0 feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach,
I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with me
one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill
a kid out of my own flock, and brin it home and dress it;
but as I was going, I saw a she-goat ying down in the shade,
and two young ki s sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday.
"Hold," said , "stand still' ; and made signs to him not to
stir ; immediately I presented my piece, shot and killed one of
the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed,
seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could
imagine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised; trembled,
and shook, and looked so amazed that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I
had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether he
was not wounded ; and, as I found resently, thought I was
resolved to kill him : for he came and kneeled down to me, and,
embracing my knees, said a great many things I did not under-
stand ; but I could easily see the meaning wasto pray me not
to kill him.

I soon found a wa to convince him that I would do him no
harm ; and taking im up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the ki which had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did : and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again. By and by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon
a tree within shot ; so, to let Friday understand a little what
I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I
say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground
under the parrot, to et him see I would make it fall, made
him understand thatI would shoot and kill that bird ; accord-
ingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the
parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, notwith-
standing all I had said to him; and I found he was the more
amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the gun,
but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death
and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or
anything near or far ofi ; and the astonishment this created in
him was such as could not wear off for a long time ; and I be-
lieve, if I would have let him, he would have worshiped me
and m gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so much as
touch it for several days after ; but he would speak to it and
talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by himself ;
which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to
kill him. Well after his astonishment was a little over at this,
I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which
he did, but stayed some time; for the parrot, not being finite
dead, had fluttered awaya good distance from the lace w rere
she fell : however, he found her, took her up, and ran ht her
to me; and as I had perceived his ignorance about t e un
before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, an to
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark
that might present; but nothin more ofiered at that time:
so I brought home the kid, an the same evenin I took the
skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and havmg a ot fit
for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the lies, and
made some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some,
I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked
it very well; but that which was strangest to him was to see
me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt was
not good to eat; and putting a little into his own month, he
seemed to nauseate it and would 5 it and sputter at it, washin
his mouth with fresh water after it ; on the other hand, I too
some meat into my month without salt, and I pretended to
spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done at the
salt ; but it would not do ; he would never care for salt with
his meat, or in his broth ; at least, not for a great while, and
then but a very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was re-
solved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the
kid ; this I did by hanging it before the fire on a strin , as I
had seen many peo le do in England, setting two poles up,
one on each srde o the fire, and one across on the top, and
tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn eon-
tinually. This Friday admired very much ; but when he came
to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well
he liked it, that I could not but understand him ; and at last
he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh
an ' more, which I was very glad to hear.

e next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before ;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of ; for after that, I let him see me make
my bread, and bake it, too : and in a little time Frida
was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it
myself.

I be an now to consider that having two mouths to feed
inste of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger quantity of corn than used'to do; so I marked
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same man~
ner as before, in which Friday worked not only very willingl
and very hard, but did it very cheerfully ; and I told him what it
was for; that it was for corn to make more bread, because he
was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and my-
self too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me
know that he thought I had much more labor upon me on his
account, than I had for myself ; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of
every place I had to send him to, and talk a great deal to me;
so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my tongue
again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before;
that is to say about speech. Besides the pleasure of talking
to him, I had a sin ular satisfaction in the fellow himself:
his simple, unfei ne honesty appeared to me more and more
every da , and I egan really to ove the creature ; and on his
side I befieve he loved me more than it was possible for him
ever to love anything before.

I had a mind onceto try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again ; and having taught him English so
well that he could answer -me almost any question, I asked him
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle. At which he smiled, and. said, " Yes, yes, we always
fight the better" ; that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight; and so we began the following discourse:

Marten--You alwa s fight the better ; how came you to be
taken gisoner then, riday? ,

E'z' y.--My nation beat much, for all that.

Eastern--How beat? If your nation beat them, how came
you to be taken ?

Malay--They more many than my nation, in the place where
the was ;' they take one, two, three, and me ; my nation over-
beat them in the yonder place, where me no was; there my
nation take one, two, reat thousand.

Master.--But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies then '1'

Friday--They run, one, two, three, and me, and make me
go in the canoe ; m nation have no canoe that time.

Marten--Well, riday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take ? Do they carry them away and eat them,
as these did ?

Mday.--Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up.

Masha--Where do the carry them? '

Eiday.--Go to other p ace, where they think.

Haslett--Do they come hither ?

Malay--Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else place.

Haslett--Have ou been here with them ?

Malay--Yes, been here (points to the N.W. side of the
island, which, it seems, was their sideg'.

By this I understood that my man riday had formerly been
among the savawes who used to come on shore on the farther
part of the island, on the said man-eating occasions that he was
now brought for ; and, some time after, when I took the courage
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me he was there once,
when they eat up twenty men, two. women, and one child ; he
could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them b
laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tel
them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ;
that after this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far
it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes
were not often lost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes
ever lost; but that after a little way out to sea, there was a
current and wind, always one way in the morning, the other in
the afternoon. This I understood to be no more than the sets
of the tide, as going out or coming in ; but I afterwards under-
stood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux of the
mighty riverOroonoko, in themouth of which river, as I thought
afterwards, our island lay ; and that this land which I perceived
to the \V. and N. W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand
questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast,
and what nations were near ; he told me all he knew, with the
greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the
several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other
name than Caribs ; from whence I easily understood that these
were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of
America which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko
to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up
a great way beyond the moon gthat was, beyond the setting of
the moon, which must be west rom their country), there dwelt
White-bearded men like me, and pointed to my great whiskers,
which Imentioned before ; and that they had killed much mans,
that was his word; by all which I understood he meant the
Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over
the whole country and were remembered by all the nations,
from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island, and get among those white men : he told me, "Yes, yes,
I might go in two canoe." I could not understand what he
meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found
he meantit must be in a large, great boat, as big as two canoes.
This part of Frida 's discourse began to relish with me very
well ; and from this time Ientertamed some hopes that, one
time or other, I mi ht find an opportunity to make my escape
from this place, an that this poor savage might be a means to
help me to do it.

uring the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind ; particularlyI asked him one time who made him. The
poor creature did not understand me at all,but thought I had
asked him who Was his father : but I took it by another handle,
and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and
the hills and woods. He told me, "It was one Benamuckee,
that lived beyond all ;" he could describe nothing of this great
person, but that he was very old, "much older," he said, " than
the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars." I asked him
then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all
things worship him ? He looked very grave. and, with a per-
fect look of innocence, said, "All things said 0! to him." I
asked him if the poo 1e who die in his country went away any-
where. He said, " es ; they all Wentto Benamuekee." Then
I asked him whether those they eat up went thither too. He
said, " Yes."

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the true God : I told him that the great Maker of all things
lived there, pointing up towards heaven ; that he governed the
world by the same power and providence by which he made
it; that he was omnipotent, and could do everything for us,
give everything to us, take everything from us ; and thus, by
de rees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention,
an received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being
sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our rayers to
God, and hisbeing able to hear us, even into heaven. 6 told me
one day, that if our God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he
must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived
but a little way of, and yet could not hear till'they went u to
the great mountains where he dwelt to s eak to him. I as ed
him if ever he went thither to speak to im, He said, "No ;
they never went that were young men ; none went thither but
the old men," whom he called their Oowokakee ; that is, as I
made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy ; and that
they went to say 0! (so he called saying prayers) and then
came back and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I
observed, that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded,
ignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of making a
secret of religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the
peo 1e to the cler y, is not only to be found in the Roman, but,

er a 8, among a lreligions in the world, even among the most

rutis and barbarous savages.

I endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and
told him that the retense of their old men going up to the
mountains to say I to their god Benamuckee was a cheat;
and their bringing word from thence what he said was much
more so ; that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit; and t en I entered
into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original of
him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason
of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to
be worshiped instead of God, and as God, and the many strata-
gems he made use of to delnde mankind to their ruin ; how he
had a secret access to our passions and to our affections, and to
adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to
be our own tempters, and run upon our own destruction by our
own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil as it was about the being of a God : na-
ture assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the
necessity of a great First Cause--an overruling, governin
Power--a secret directing Providence ; and of the equity and
'ustice of paying homa e to him that made us, and the like :

ut there appeared not ing of this kind in the notion of an
evil spirit ; of his original, his being, his nature; and, above
all, of hisinclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too:
and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a
question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what
to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the
power of God, his omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his being
a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity ; how, as he had
made us all, he could destroy us and all the world in a moment ;
and he listened with great seriousness to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil was God's
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill
to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the king-
dom of Christ in the world, and the like. " Well," sa s Fri-
day; "but you say God is so strong, so reat; is e not
much stron , much might as the devil?" " es, yes," says I,
" Friday; god is stronger than the devil : God is above the
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under
our feet, and to enable us to resist his temptations and quench
his fiery darts." " But," sa 3 he again, "if God much strong,
much might as the devil, w y God nokill the devil, so make
him no more do wicked?" was strangely surprised at this
question ; and after all though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a oung doctor, and ill qualified for a casuist, or solver of
difficulties ; and at first Icould not tell what to say ; so I pre-
tended not to hear him, and asked him what he said ; but he
was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that
he re eated it in the vet same broken words as above. By
this time I had recovere myself a little, and I said, " God will
at last unish him severely ; he is reserved for the judgment,
and he is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with ever-
lasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday; but he returns up-
on me, repeating my own words, " 'Reserve at last." me no
understan : but why not kill the devil now; not kill great
ago?" "You may as well ask me," said I, "why God does
not kill you or me, when we do wicked things here that ofiend
him : we are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He muses
awhile on this : " Well, well," says he, mightily affectionately,
"that well: so you, I, devil, all wicked, all reserve, repent,
God pardon all.' Here I was run down by im to the last
degree : and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions
of nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to the
knowled e of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the
supreme eing of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet
nothing but Divine revelation can form the knowled eof Jesus
Christ, and of redemption purchased for us ; of a 1i ediator of
the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne ; I say, nothing but arevelation from heaven can
form these in the soul ; and that, therefore, the gospel of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and
the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his
people, are the absolutel necessary Instructors of 'the souls of
men in the saving know edge of God and the means of salva-
tion.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and
my man, rising up hastily as upon some sudden occasion of
going out ; then sending him for something a good way off, I
seriously rayed to God that he would enable me to instruct
savingly t is poor savage ; assisting by his Spirit the heart of
the cor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge
of od in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would guide
me to speak so to him from the Word of God, that his con-
science might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved.
When he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse
with him u on the subject of the redemption of man by the
Saviour of t e world, and of the doctrine o the gospel preached
from heaven--viz., of re entauce towards God, and faith in
our blessed Lord Jesus. then explained to him as well as I
could why our blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature
of angels, but the seed of Abraham ; and how, for that reason,
the fallen angels had no share in the redemption ; that he came
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and must
acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same princi-
ple will find, that, in laying things open to him, I reall informed
and instructed myself in many t ings that I either di not know,
or had not fully considered before, but which occurred naturally
to my mind upon searching into them, for the information of
this poor sava e ; and I had more affection in my inquiry after
things upon t is occasion than ever I felt before; so that,
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I
had reason to be thankful that ever he came to me ; my grief
sat lighter upon me ; my habitation grew comfortable to me
beyond measure ; and when I reflected that in this solitary life
which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved to
look up to heaven myself, and to seek the hand that had brought
me here, but was now to be made an instrument, under Provi:
dence, to save the life, and, for anght I know, the soul of a poor
savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and
of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to
know whom is life eternal ; I say, when I reflected upon all
these things, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul,
and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place,
which I had so often thought the most dreadful of'all afilictions
that could possibly have befallen me.

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and me were such as made the three years which we
lived there together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete liappiness'can be found in a sublunary
state. This savag'e was now a good Christian, a much better
than I ; though I ave reason to hope, and bless God for it, that
we were equally enitent, and comforted, restored penitents.
We had here the 0rd of God to read, and no farther of from
His Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in En land. I always
ap lied myself, in reading the Scriptures, to et him know, as
we 1 as I could, the meaning of what I read ; and hea ain, by
his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, asI sai before,
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than I should
ever have been by my own mere private reading. Another
thing I cannot refrainfrom observinghere also, from experience
in this retired part of my life--viz., how infinite and inexpressi-
ble a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of the doc-
trine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the
Word of God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as
the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understand-
ing enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the teat
work of sincere repentance for my sins, and of laying ho d of
a Saviour for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in
practice, and obedience to all God's commands, and this with-
out any teacher or instructor, I mean human ; so the same plain
instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage
creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have
known few equal to him in my life.

As to the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which
have happened in the world about religion, whether niceties in
doctrines or schemes of church government, they were all per-
fectly useless to us, and, for alight I can yet see, they have been
to the rest of the world. We had the sure uide to heaven,
viz., the Word of God ; and we had,blessed Iie God, comfort-
able views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing us by
his word, leading us into all truth, and makin us both willing
and obedient to the instruction of his word. nd I cannot see
the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points
of religion, which have made such confusions in the world,
would have been to us, if we could have obtained it; but I
must go on with the historical part of things, and take every
part in its order.
After Friday and Ibecame more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him
with my own story, or at least so much of it as related to my
coming into this place ; how I had lived there, and how long :
I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of n-
powder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave im
a knife, with which he was wonderfully delighted ; and I made
him a belt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in England we
wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave
him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in some
cases, but much more useful upon many occasions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we wor-
shi ed God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
tr. Bed in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an account
of the wreck which had been on board of, and showed him,
as near as I could, the place where she lay: but she was all
beaten in pieces long before, and quite gone. I showed him
the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which
I could not stir with my whole strength then ; but was now
fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood
musing a great wlule, and said nothing. I asked 'him what it
was he studied upon. At last, says he, " Me see such boat like
come to place at my nation." I did not understand him a good
while; but, at last, when I had examined further into it, I
understood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came
on shore upon the countr where he lived; that is, as he ex-
plained it, was driven thit er by stress of weather. I presently
imagined that some European ship must have been cast away
upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and drive
ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of men
making their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence
they might come: so I only inquired after the description
of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought
me better to understand him when he added With some warmth,
" We save the white mans from drown." Then I presently
asked if there were any white mans, as he called them, in the
boat. "Yes," he said; " the boat full of white mans." I
asked him how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I
asked him then what became of them. He told me, "They
live, they dwell at my nation."

This at new thoughts into my head; for I presently im-
agined t at these might be the men belonging to the ship that
was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called it ; and
who, after the shi was struck on the rock and they saw her in-
evitably lost, hadP saved themselves in their boat, and were
landed upon that wild shore among the sava es. Upon this I
inquired of him more critically what was ecome of them.
He assured me they lived still there ; that they had been there
about four years ; that the savages left them alone, and gave
them viotuals to live. I asked him how it came to ass that
they did not kill them and eat them. He said, " 0, they
make brother with them ;" that is, as I understood him, a
truce ; and then he added, " They no eat mans but when make
the war fight ;" that is to say, they never eat any men but
such as come to fight with them, and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that bein upon the
top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from w ence, as I
have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent
of America, Friday, the weather being very_serene, looks very
earnestly towards the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise,
falls a-jumping and dancin , and calls out to me, for I was at
some distance from him. asked him what was the matter.
" 0h, joy ! " says he ; " oh, glad ! there see my country, there
my nation 1" I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure ap-

eared in his face and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance

iscovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his
own country again. his observation of mine put a great
many thoughts into me, which made me at rst not so
easy about my new man Frida as I was before ; and I made no
doubt but that, if Friday con (1 get back to his own nation
again, he would not only for et all his religion, but all his ob-
ligation to me, and would e forward enough to give his
countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, with a
hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which
he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies,
when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest'
creature very much, for which I was very sorry afterwards.
However, as my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks,
I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind
to him as before : in which I was certainly in the wron too:
the honest grateful creature having no thou ht about it, but
what consisted with the best principles hot as a religious
Christian, and as a grateful friend ; as appeared afterwards to
my full satisfaction.

While my jealousy] of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping im, to see if he would discover an of the
new tho'ughts which I suspected were in him; but found
everything he said was so honest and so innocent, that I could
find nothingl to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness, e made me at ast entirely his own again ; nor did
he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could
not sus ect him of deceit.

One ay, walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to
him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own
country, your own nation? " " Yes," he said, " I be much 0
glad to be at m own nation." " What would you do there ?"
said I : " woul you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, and
be a savage, as you were before?" He looked full of concern,
and shaking his head, said, " No, no ; Friday tell them to live
good; tell them to pray God: tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle--flesh, milk ; no eat man again." " Why, then," said I to
him, " they will kill you." I-Iedooked grave at that, and then
said, " No, no; they no kill me, they willing love learn." IIe
meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added, they
learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then
I asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that,
and told me he could not swim so far. I told him, I would
make a canoe for him. He told me he would go if I would go
with him. " I go!" says I; " why they will eat me if I come
there." " No, no," says he, "me make them no eat on ; me
make them much love you." He meant, he would tell t iem how
I had killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would
make them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how
kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men as he
called them, who came on shore in distress,

From this time, Iconfess, I had a mind to venture over, and
see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who,I
made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese 3 not doubting
but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good company to-
gether, better than I could from an island forty miles off the
shore, alone, and without help. So, after some days, I took
Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I
would give him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and, ac-
cordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always
kept it sunk in the water) I brought it out, showed it him, and
we both went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow
at managing it and would make it go almost as swift and
fast again as I could. So when he was in, I said to him,
" Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation '1'" He looked
very dull at my saying so; which it seems was because he
thought. the boat too small to go so far. Ithen told him I had
a bigger ; so the next day I went to the place where the first
boat lay which I had ma 9, but which I could not et into the
water. He said that was big enough ; but then, as had taken
no care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was rotten. Friday
told me that such a boat would do very well, and would carry
" much enough vittle, drink, bread; '--that was his way of
talking.

Upon the _whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design
of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we
would 0 and make one as big as that, and he should go home
in it. tile answered not one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him what was the matter with him, He asked
me again, "Wh you angry mad with Frida ?--what me
done ? " Iasked im what he meant. I told him Iywas not angry
with him at all. "No an ry ?" says he, repeating the words
several times; " why sen Friday home away to my nation '1'"
"Why, " sa s I, " Friday, did not you say you wished you were
there?" " es, yes," says he, " Wish we both there ; no wish
Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would not think
of omg there without me. "I go there, Friday?" says I:
" w at shall I do there '1'" He turned very quick upon me at
this. "You do great deal much good," says he; " you teach
wild mans be good, sober, tame mans ; ou tell them know God,

ray God,~and live new life." "Alas, riday ! " says I, "thou
Enowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man my-
self." " Yes, yes," says he, " you teachee me good, you teachee
them good." " No, no, Friday," says I, " you shall go without
me; leave me here to live by myself, as I did before." He
looked confused again at that word ; and running to one of his
hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives
it to me. " What must I do with this? " says I to him. " You
take kill Friday," says he. " W'hat must I kill you for? " said
I again. He returns very quick: " What you send Friday
away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he
spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word,
I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me, and a
firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after,
that I would never send him away from me, if he was willing
to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled af-
fection to me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I
found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country17 6 ROBINSON 030501;.

was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of
my doing them good ; a thing which, as I had no notion of
myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of
undertaking it. But still I found astrong inclination to m at-
tempting an escape, founded on the supposition gathered rom
the former discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men
there ; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to work
with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a
large pcriagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were
trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of per-
iaguas or canoes, but even of good large vessels ; but the main
thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I com-
mitted at first. At last, Friday pitched u on a tree; for I
found he knew much better than I what kin of wood was fit-
test for it ; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the
tree we cut down, except that it was verylike the tree we call
fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was
much of the same color and smell. Friday was for burning
the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it into a boat, but
I showed him how rather to cut it with tools; which, after I
had showed him how to use, he did very handily ; and in about
a month's hard labor, we finished it and made it very handsome ;
especially, when, with our axes, whichI showed him how to
handle, we cut and he wed the outside into the true shape of aboat
After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her
along, as it were, inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water;
but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with
greatease.

When she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed
me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday
could manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked
him if we would, and if we mi ht venture over in her. " Yes,"
he said ; " we venture over in er very well, though great blow
wind." However, I had a farther design that he knew noth-
ing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to lit her
with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough
to get ; so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which
I found near the lace, and which there was great plenty of in
the island, and set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail,
that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather
pieces of old sails, enough ; but as I had had them now six-
and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to pre-
serve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind ofCause: Asp Fun)" Luvscu rm: Bu.rr.---Pnge176.
use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten ; and,
indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two pieces,
which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work;
and with a great deal of pains, and awkward, tedious stitching,
you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length made a three-
cornered ugl thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-
of-mutton sail, to go with aboom at bottom, and a little short
sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' longboats sail with,
and such as I best know how to manage, because it was such a
one as I used in the boat in which I made my escape from Bar-
bary, as related in the first part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work--viz, rig-
ging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to
assist if we should turn to windward; and, which was more
than all, I fixed arudder to the stern of her to steer with. And
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the
usefulness, and even the necessity of such a thing, I applied
myself with so much ains to do it, that at last I brought it to

ass ; though, consi ering the many dull contrivances I had
or it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much labor as
making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to
what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he
knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing of
what belonged to a sail and a rudder ; and was the most
amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea
by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and [led this way
or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, when he
saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. However,
with a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and
he became an expert sailor, exce t that as to the compass I
could make him understand very ittle of that. On the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or
never any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for
the compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night,
and the shore by dav, except in the rainy seasons, and then no-
body cared to stir ahroad either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place ; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account,
my habitation being ulte of another kind than in all the rest
of my time. I kept t e anniversar 1 of my landing here with
the same thankfulness to God for is mercies as at first: and
if I had .such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much
more so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of
Providence over me, and the gireat ho es I had of being effect-
ually and speedily delivere ; for had an invincible im-
pression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand,
and that I should not be another year in this place. However,
I went on with my husbandry ; digging, planting, and fencing,
as usual. I gathered and cure my grapes, and did every
necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I
kept more within doors than at other times. I had stowed
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the
creek, where, as Isaid in the beginning, I landed my rafts from
the ship ; and hanlinnr her up to the shore at high-water mark,
I made my man Fri ay dig a little dock, just big enbugh to
hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to
float in ; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong
dam across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she
lay dry as to the tide from the sea : and to keep the rain off,
we laid a reat many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as
well thatc ed as a house ; and thus we waited for the months
of November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing
daily for the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay by
a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voy-
age; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open
the dock, and launch out our boat. I was bus one morning
upon something of this kind, when I called to 'riday, and bid
lnm go to the seashore, and see if he could find a turtle or
tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the
sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
gone long when he came running back, and flew over my outer
wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the ste s
he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak to him, 1e
cries out to me " 0 master! 0 master 1 0 sorrow l 0 bad 1"
" What's the matter, Friday?" said I. " 0h! yonder, there,"
says he ; "one, two, three canoes ; one, two, three!" By this
way of speaking, I concluded there were six ; but on inquiry I
found there were but three. " "Tell, Friday," says I, " do not be
frightened." So I heartened him up as well as I could. How-
ever, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing
ran in his head but that they were come back to look for him,
and would cut him in pieces and eat him ; and the poor fellow
trembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. . I com-
forted him as well as I- could, and told him I was in as much
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him.
" But," said I, " Friday, we must resolve to fi ht them. Can
you fight, Friday?" " Me shoot," says he ; " ut there come
many great number." "No matter for that," said I, again ;
" our uns will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked
him w ether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me,
and standb me, and do just as I bid him. He said, " Me die,
when you id die, master." So I went and fetched a ood
dram of rum and ave him; for I had been so good a hue and
of my rum, that had a great deal left. When he had drunk
it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always
carried, and load them with large swanshot,as big as small
pistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them
with two slugs, and five small bullets each ; and my two pistols
I loaded with a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword,
as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my fierspective-glass,
and went u to the side of the hill, to see what could discover ;
and I foun quickly by my glass that there were one-and-
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; and that
their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies ; a barbarous feast indeed, but nothin
more than, as I had observed, was usual with them. I observe
also that they landed, not where they had done when Friday
made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was
low, and where a thick wood came close almost down to the sea.
This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches
came about, filled me with such indignation that I came down
againto Frida , and told him I was resolved to go down to
them, and kill t em all ; and asked him if he would stand by me.
He had now got over his fright, and his spirits being a little
raised with the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful,
and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die.

In this fit of fury I took first and divided the arms which I
had charged, as before, between us ; I gave Friday one pistol
to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder, and I
took one pistol_and the other three myself ; and in this posture
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in in pocket,
and gave Friday a large bag with more owder an bullets;
and as to orders, I charged him to keep c ose behind me, and
not to stir, or shoot, or do anythin till I bid him, and in the
meantime not to speak a word. n this posture I fetched a
compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over
the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come within
shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen
by my glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution--I do not mean that
I entertained any fear of their number, for, as they were naked,
unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them--nay,
though I had been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts,
what call, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was in to
go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had
neither done nor intended me any wrong ?--who, as to me, were
innocent, and whose barbarous customswere their own dis-
aster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's having left them,
with the other nations of that part of the world, to such stu-
pidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me to
take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an exe-
cutioner of his justice--that whenever he thought fit he would
take the cause into his own hands, and by national vengeance
punish them for national crimes ; but that, in the meantime,
it was none of my business--that it was true Friday might
justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in a state of
war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for
himto attack them ; but I could not say the same with regard
to myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only
go and lace myself near them that I might observe their bar-
barous east, and that I would act then as God should direct ;
and that unless something oifered that was more a call to me
than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all pos-
sible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels,
I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood on the side which
was next to them, only that one corner of the wood lay between
me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him
a great tree, which was 'ust at the corner of the wood, I bade
him go to the tree, and ring me word if he could see there
plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came im-
mediately back to me, and told me the might be plainly
viewed there--that they were all about t ieir fire eatmg the
flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon
the sand alittle from them, whom he said they would kill next ;
and this fired the very soul within me. He told me it was not
one of their nation but one of the bearded men whom he had
told me of, that came to their country in a boat. I was filled
with horror at the very naming of the white, bearded man ;
and going to the tree, saw plainly by my glass a white man,"wn'u THAT I sun-m mesa THE .uuzsn s.u'AGEs."--l'uge 151
who lay u on the beach of the sea with his hands and feet
tied with ags, or things like rushes, and that he was a European
and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which
by going a little way about,I saw I mi ht come at undis-
covered, and that then I should be within alf a shot of them;
so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged to
the hi hest degree; and going back about twent paces, I got
behin some bushes, which held all the way till came to the
other tree, and then came to a little rising round, which gave
me a full view of them at the distance of aiout eighty ards.

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen o the read-
ful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together,
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian,
and bring him erhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they
were stooping own to untie the bands at his feet. I turned
to Friday. " Now, Friday," said I, " do as I bid thee." Friday
said he would. "Then, Friday," said I, "do exactly as you
see me do; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the muskets
and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the
like by his, and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him if he was
ready, he said, " Yes." "Then fire at them," said I; and at
the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more;
and on m side I killed one, and wounded two. They were,
you may e sure, in a dreadful consternation; and all of them
that were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not
immediately know which way to run, or which way to look,
for they knew not from whence their destruction ' came.
Friday ept his e es close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he
might observe w at I did; so, as soon as the first shot was
made, I threw down the iece, and took up the fowling-piece,
and Friday did the like; 1e saw me cock and present; he did
the same again. "Are you ready, Friday '1'" said I. "Yes, "
says he. "Let fly, then," said I, "in the name of God i " and
with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so
did Friday; and as our ieces were now loaded with what I
call swanshot, or smal pistol-bullets, we found only two
drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran about yelling
and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of
them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly af-
ter,'though not quite dead.
"Now, Frida ," said I, la in down the discharged pieces,
and taking u t e musket w ic was yet loaded, " ollow me,"
which he di with a great deal of courage; upon which I
rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday close
at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as
as fast as I could, which by the way was not very fast, being
loaded with arms as I was, I made direct] toward the poor
victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the each or shore, be-
tween the place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers
who were just going to work with him had left him at the
surprise of our rst fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-
side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him ste
forward and fire at them; he understood me immediately, an
runnin about forty ards to be nearer them, he shot at them;
and I t ought he kil ed them all, for I saw them all fall of a
heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up again

uickly; however, he killed two of them, and wounded the
t ird so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he
had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosin his
hands and feet, I lifted him u , and asked him, in the or-
tuguese tongue, what he was. e answered, in Latin, Christi-
anus; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand or
speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him,
making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave
him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what
countryman he was, and he said Espagnole; and being a little
recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly
make, how much he was in m debt for his deliverance.
"Seignior," said I, with as much gpanish as I could make up,
"we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now; if you have
any strength left, take this istol and sword, and lay about
you." He took them very t ankfully; and no sooner had he
the arms in his hands, but, as if they had put new vigor into
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had cut two
of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole
was a su rise to them, so the poor creatures were so much
frightene with the noise of our pieces that they fell down for
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt
their own escape, than their flesh had to resrst our shot : and
that was the case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat,-l"mun: on .25 mEz_>>==.I--.:r.n :w...
for as three of them fell with the hurt they received, so the
other two fell with the fright.

I ke t my piece in my hand still without firing, being will-
ing to eep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard
my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade him run
u to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms
which lay there that had been discharged, which he did with
great swrftness; and then giving him my musket, I sat down
in self to load all the rest a ain, and bade them come to me
w ien they wanted. While was loading these pieces, there
hap ened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one
of t e savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him
before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as
bold and brave as could be imagined, though weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had cut two great wounds on
his head; but the savagle being a stout lusty fellow, closing in
with him, had thrown im down, being faint, and was wring-
ing my sword out of his hand; when the Spaniard, though
undermost, wisely quitted the sword, drew the pistol from his
girdle, shot the savage through the body, and killed him upon
the spot, before I, who was running to help him, could come
near 1111. .

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flyin
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and
with that he dispatched those three who, as I said before,
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could
come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave
him one of the fowlin -pieces, with which he pursued two of
the savages, and woun ed them both; but, as he was not able
to run, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday
pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other was too
nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had plunged
himself into the sea, and swam with all his might of to those
two who were left in the canoe;which three in the canoe, with
one wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were
all that escaped our hands, of one-and-twenty. The account of
the whole is as follows: Three killed at our first shot from
the tree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in
the boat; two killed by Friday, of those at first wounded; one
killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four
killed, being found dro ped here and there, of the wounds,
or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four escaped in the
boat, whereof one wounded if not dead--twenty-one, in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-
shot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I
did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have
had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them ; and, indeed,
I was ve anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news
home to t eir people, they should come back perhaps with two
or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere multi-
tude ; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to
one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ;
but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find another
poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard
was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing
what was the matter; for he had not been able to look u over
the side of the boat, he was tied so hard, neck and hee s, and
had been tied so long, that he had really little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have helped him up, but he
could not stand or speak, but groaned most iteousl , believ-
ing, it seems, still, that he was only unboun in or er to be
killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and pullin out my bottle,
made him give the poor wretch adram ; whic 1, with the news
of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat.
But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face,
it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how Frida
kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooe ,
'umped about, danced, sung ; then cried again, wrung his

ands, beat his own face and head ; and then sung and 'umped
about a ain like a distracted creature. It was a good while
before could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the
matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me that
it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what
ecstasy and filial alfection had worked in this poor savage at
the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death ;
nor, indeed, can I describe half the extravagances of his affec-
tion after this ; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat,
a great many times : when he went in to him, he would sit
down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close
to his bosom half an hour together, to nourish it ; then he took
his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the
binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands ; and I,
perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of m

ottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of goo .

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight ; and
it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard with-
in two hours after, and before they could be got a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the northwest, which was against them, that I could not
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their
own coast.

But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him 0E for some time ;
but after I thought he could leave him a little I called him to
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme ; then I asked him if he had iven his father
any bread. He shook his head, and said, " one; ugly dog
eat all up self." I then gave him acake of bread, out of a
little ouch I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram for
himse f ; but he would not taste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of raisins, so I
gave him a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner
given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the
boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched, for he was
the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw ; I say, he ran
at such a rate that he was out of si ht, as it were, in an instant ;
and though I called, and hallooegl out, too, after him, it was
all one--away he went ; and in a quarter of an 110an saw him
come back a ain, though not so fastas he went; and, as he
came nearerfi found his pace slacker, because he had something
in his hand. When he came up to me, I found he had been

uite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his father some

resh water, and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of
bread : the bread he ave me, but the water he carried to his
father ; however, as was very thirsty too, I took a little sup
of it. This water revived his father more than all the rum or
spirits I had iven him, for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his ather had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was any water left ; he said " Yes " ; and I bade him give to
the poor S aniard, who was in as much want of it as his
father; an I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to
the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself 11 )on a green place under the shade of a tree; and
whose lim s were also very stifl, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. WhenIsaw that upon
Friday's coming to him with the water he sat up and drank,
and took the bread and began to eat, I went to him and gave
him a handful of raisins; he looked up in my face with all the
tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any
countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so
exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon
his feet ; he tried to do it two or three times, but was really
not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so
I bade him sit still, and caused Frida to rub his ankles, and
bathe them with rum, as he had done iis father's.

Iobserved the poor affectionate creature even two minutes,
or perha 3 less, al the while he was here, turned is head about,
to see if is father was in the same place and posture as he left
him sitting; and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at
which he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew with
that swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive his feet
to touch the ground as he went : but when he came, he only
'found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday
came back to me presently ; and I then spoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday be] him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat,
and then he s ould carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him. But Friday, a lusty young fellow, took the
Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him away to the
boat, andsethim down softly upon the side or gunnel of the
canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then lifted him quite
in, and set him close to his father; and presently steppin out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the s ore
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew prettyhard
too ; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and, leaving
them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he

assed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went.

e told me, " Go fetch more boat " ; so away he went like the
wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him ; and he had
the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by
land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new
guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were neither
of them able to walk ; so that poor Fridayknew not what to do.

_ To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me,
I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday
and I carried them up both together upon it between us.

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or for-
tification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was
im ossible to get them over, and I was resolved not to break
it own; so I set to work again, and Friday and I, in about
two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered with old
sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the space
without our outward fence, and between that and the grove of
young wood whichIhad planted ; and here we made them two
beds of such things as I had, viz., of cod rice straw, with
blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and anot er to cover them, on
each bed.

M island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich

in an jects; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently
made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole coun-
try was my own mere property, so that I had an undoubted
right of dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectl sub-
'ected ; I was absolutely lord and lawgiver ; they all owed' their
ives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there
had been occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had
but three subjects, and they were of three different religions:
my man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and
a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist. However, I allowed
liberty of conscience throughout my dominion. But this is by
the wa . .

As sion as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon,I be an
to think of making some provisions for them; and the rst
thin I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling oat, betwixt
a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be illed ; when
I cut of the binder quarter, and chopping it into small pieces,
I set Frida to work to boiling and stewing, and made them
a very goo dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, having ut
some barley and rice also into the broth ; and as I cooke it
without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I
carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there
for them, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them,
and, as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged them.
Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed,
to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the language of
the savages pretty well. '

After we had dined, or rather sup ed, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes and go and fete our muskets and other
firearms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the lace
of battle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and Eury
the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,and
would presently be ofiensive. I also ordered him to bury the
horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not
think of doing myself : nay, I could not bear to see them, if I
went that way ; all which he punctually performed, and defaced
the very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when
I went a ain, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise
than by t ie corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and
whether we might expect a return of them, with a power too

reat for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
1n the boat never could live out the storm which blew that
night they went ofi', but must, of necessity, be drowned, or
driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure
to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast
away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on
shore, he said he knew not ; but it was his opinion that they
were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their bein
attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would
tell the eople the were all killed b thunder and lightning,
not b the hand 0 men ; and that t 16 two which appeared,
viz., riday and I, were two heavenly s irits, or furies, come
down to destroy them, and not men wit weapons. This he
said he knew because he heard them all cry out so, in their
language, one to another; for it was impossible for them to
conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and
kill at a distance without lifting up the hand, as was done now ;
and this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood
since, by other hands, the savages never attem ted to 0
over to the island afterwards ; they were so terri 'ed with t is
accounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape
the sea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted is-
land would be destroyed with fire from the gods. This, how-
ever, I knew not, and therefore was under continual appre-
hension for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, I
and all my army; for, as we were now four of us, would
have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field,
at any time.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear
of their coming were 05 ;'and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voya e to the main into consideration; being
likewise assured b riday's father thatImight depend upon

ood usage from t eir nation, on his account, if I would go.

ut my thou hts were a little sus ended when I had a serious
discourse wit the Spaniard, and w en I understood that there
were sixteen more of his countr men and Portuguese, who,
having been cast away and made t ieir escape to that side, lived
there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were very sore put
to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the
particulars of their voyage, and found they werea Spaniel) ship,

ound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, being directed
to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver,
and to bring back what European goods they could meet with
there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom
they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men
were drowned, when first the ship was lost, and that these
escaped through infinite danger and hazards, and arrived, almost
starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have
been devoured every moment. He told me the had some
arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, or that they
had neither powder nor ball, the washin of the sea having
spoiled all their powder but a little, whic they used, at their
first landing, to provide themselves some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there,
and if the had formed no design of making any escape. He
said they ad many consultations about it; but that having
neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind,
their councils always ended in tears and despair. I asked him
how he thought they would receive a proposal from me, which
might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they were all
here, it mi ht not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in
their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the
nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings by the
obligations they had received so much as they did by the ad-
vantages they ex ected. I told him it would be very hard
that I should be t 1e instrument of their deliverance, and that
they should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain,
where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what
necessity, or what accident soever brought him thither; and
that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be de-
voured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests,
and be carried into the Inquisition. I added that, otherwise, I
was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away, either
to the Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast
northward ; but that if, in requital, they should, when I had
put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their
own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and
make my case worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal of candor and ingenuousness,
that their condition was so miserable, and that they were so
sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought
of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their
deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them, with
the old man, and discourse with them aboutit and return again,
and bring me their answer: that he would make conditions
with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be abso-
lutely under my direction, as their commander and captain ; and
they should swear upon the holy sacrament and gospel, to be
true to me, and go to such Christian country as I should agree
to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutel by
my orders, till they were landed safely in such country as in-
tended ; and that re would brin a contract from them, under
their hands, for that purpose. ' hen he told me he would first
swear to me himself, that he would never stir from me as long
as he lived, till I gave him orders; and that he would take my
side to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the
least breach of faith amorm his countrymen. He told me they
were all of them very civi , honest men, and they were under
the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the
savages; 'out of all hopes of ever returning to their own coun-
try; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief,
the would live and die by me.

Ilpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them,
if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over
to them to treat. But when we had got all things in readiness
to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudencein it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the
other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it;
and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for
at least half a year. The case was thus : he had been with us
now about a month, durin which time I had let him see in
what manner I had provide , with the assistance of Providence,
for my support ; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and
rice I had laid up; which, though it was more than sufficient
for myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good husbandry,
for my family, now it was increased to four; but much less
would it be suficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said,
fourteen, still alive, should come over ; and, least of all would
it be suflicient to victualour vessel, if we should build one, for a
voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America ; so he told
mehe thought it would be more advisable to let him and the
other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could
spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that
we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they
should come ; for want might be a temptation to them to dis-
a tee, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out
0 one difiiculty into another. "You know," says he, " the
children of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their bein
delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himselE
that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the
wilderness."

His caution was'so seasonable, and his advice so good, that
I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his fidelity ; so we fell to digging, all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with

ermitted ; and in about a month's time, by the end of which
it was seed~time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed
up, as we sowed two-and-tweuty bushels of barley on, and six-
teen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to
spare; indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient for our own
food for the six months that we had to expect our crop ; that
is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for
sowin ; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the
groun in that country. ,

Having new society enough, and our number being sufiicient
to ut us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless
their number had been very great, we went freely all over the
island, whenever we found occasion ; and as we had our escape
or deliverance u on our thoughts, it was im%pssible, at least
for me, to have t e means of it out of mine. or this purpose,
I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our work,
and I set Friday and his father to cut them down ; and then I
caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thou hts on that
afl'air, to oversee and direct their work. I showe them with
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a lar e tree into single
planks, andIcaused themto do the like, til they had made
about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad,
thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick ;
what prodigious la or it took u , any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrive to increase my little stock of
tame goats as much as I could ; and for this purpose I made
Friday and the S aniard go out one day, and myself with
Friday the next ay (for we took our turns), and by this
means we at about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest ; for w enever we shot the dam, we saved the kids and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing
the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to
be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant,
where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled
sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, formed a
great part of our food--very good living too, I assure you, for
they are exceeding nourishing.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but,how-
ever, it was enough to answer our en'dgfor, from twenty-two
bushels of barley, we brought in and thrashed out above two
hundred and twenty bushe s; and the like in proportion of the
rice; which was store enough for our food tothe next harvest,
though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me;
or, if we had been ready fora voyage, it would very plentifully
have-victu'aled our ship to have carried us to airy art of the
world, that is to say, of America. When we ha t us housed
and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make
more wickerwork, viz., great baskets, in which we kept it; and
the Spaniardwas very handy and dexterous atthis part, and often
blamed me that I did not make some things for defense of
this kind of work;but I saw no need of it.

And now, having a full su ply of food for all the guests
expected, I gave t e Spaniard) leave to go over the main, to
see what he could do With those he had left behind him there.
I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man with him who
would not first swear,in the presence of himself and the old
savage, that he would no way injure, fi ht with, or attack the
person he should find in the island, w 0 was so kind as to
send for them in order to their deliverance; but that they
would stand by him and defend him against all such attempts,
and wherever they went, would be entirely under and subjected
to his command ; and that this should be put in writing, and
si ned with their hands. How. they were to have done this,
w en I knew they had neither pen nor ink--that, indeed, was
a question which we never asked. Under these instructions,
the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday, went
away in one of the canoes which the mi ht be said to have
come in, or rather were brought in, w en t ey came as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages. I ave each of them a musket,
with a fireloek on it, and about eig t char es of powder and
ball, charging them to be very good husSSands of both, and
not to use either of them but upon urgent occasion.

This was a cheerful work, bein the first measures used by
me, in view of m deliverance, or now twent -seven years
and some days. gave them provisions of brea , and of dried
grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient
for all the gpaniards for about eight days' time; and wishing
them a goo voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them about
a si nal they should hang out at their return, by which I
shou d know them again, when they came back, at a distance,
before they came on shore. They went away, with a fair
gale, on the day the moon was at full, by my account, in the
month of October ; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after
I had once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had I
kept even the number of years so unctually as to be sure I
was right, though, as it proved, w en I afterwards examined
my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the
like hasnot, perhaps, been heard of in histor . I was fast asleep
in my hutch one morning, when my man riday came running
in to me, and called aloud, " Master, master, they are come,
they are come !" I jum ed up, and, regardless of danger, I
went out as soon as I cou d get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which, b the way, was by this time grown to be
a very thick wood ; say, regardless of danger, I went without
m arms, which was not my custom to do : but I was surprised,
w en, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at
about a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder-of--mutton sail, as the call it, and the .wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in : a so I observed, presently,
that they did not come from that side which the shore lay on,
but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this
I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not
the people we looked for, and that we might not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies. In the next place, I
went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see what could
make of them ;and,haviug taken the ladder out, I climbed
up to the to of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehen-
sive of anyt in , and to take my view plainer, without being
discovered. I ad scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two
leagues and a half distance from me, S.S.E., but not above a
league and a half from the shore. By my observation, it ap-
pearedEplainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to

e an nglish longboat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of
seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as
I cannot describe; but- et I had some secret doubts hung
about me--I cannot tell gem whence they came--bidding me
keep upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to
consider what business an English ship could have in that
part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part
of the world where the English had any traffic ; and I knew
there had been no storms to drive them in there, in distress;
and that if they were really English, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good designs; and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and
murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no
possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices are
given us, I believe few that have made any observations of
things can deny ;that they are certain discoveries of an invis-
ible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if
the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why
should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent,
(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the ques-
tion), and that they are given for our good ?

The present question abundant] confirms me in the justice
of this reasoning ; for had I not een made cautious by this
secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been un-
done inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before,as
you will see presently. I had not kept myself long in this
posture, till I saw the boat draw near the shore,as if they

ooked for a creek to thrust it in at, for convenience of landing ;
however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not
see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran
their boat on shore u on the beach, at about half a mile from
me ; which was very appy for me ; for otherwise they would
have landed just at my door,as I'may say, and would soon
have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have lundered
me of all I bad. When they were on shore, I was flilly satis-
fied the were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two
I thong t were Dutch, but it did not prove so ; there were in
all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed,
and, asI thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of
them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the
boat, as prisoners : one of the three I could perceive using the
most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair,
even to a kind of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive,
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, in-
deed, but not to such a de ree as the first. I was perfectly
confounded at the sight, an knew not what the meaning of 1t
should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he
could, " 0 master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well
as savage mans." "Why, Friday," says I, "do you think
they are going to eat them, then?"--" Yes," says Friday,
"they will eat them."--" No, no," says I, " Friday ; I am
afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure
the will not eat them."

, 111 this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the si ht, ex ect-
ing every moment when the three prisoners shoul be ki led ;
nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a reat
cutlass,asthe seamen call it, or sword, to strike one o the
poor men; and Iexpected to see him fall every moment; at
which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my
veins. I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage
that was gone with him, or that I had any way to have come
undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have secured
the three men, for I saw no firearms they had among them ;
but it fell out to my mind another way. After I had observed
the outra eous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen,
I observed the fellows run scattering about theland, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed also that the three
other men had liberty to go where they pleased ; but they sat
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like
men in despair. This put me in mind of the first time when I
came on shore, and began to look about me ; how I gave my-
self over for lost ; how wildly I looked round me ; what dread-
ful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the tree all
night, for fear of being devoured by wild easts. As I knew
nothing, that night, 0 the supply I was to receive by the
providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms
and tide, by which have since been so long nourished and
supported 5 so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it
was to them, and how efiectually and really they were in a
condition of safety, at the same time the thought themselves
lost, and their case des erate. So little 0 we see before us in
the world, and so muc reason have we to depend cheerfully
upon the great Maker of the world, that he does not leave
his creatures so absolutel destitute, but that, in the worst
circumstances, they have a ways something to be thankful for,
and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine ;
nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means by
which they seem to be brought to their destruction.

It was just at them of high ivater when these eople came
on shore ; and while t iey rambled about to see w at kind of
a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leav-
ing their boat aground. They had left two men in the boat,
who as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much
brandy, fell aslee ; however, one of them waking a little
sooner than the ot ier, and finding the boat too fast aground
for him' to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were strag-
gling about ; upon which they all soon came to the boat ; but
it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being
very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand,
almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen,
who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind iven to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolle about the country
again ; and-I heard one of them sa aloud to another, calling
them ofi from the boat, " Why, let er alone, Jack, can't you ?
she'll float next tide ;" by which I was fully confirmed in the
main inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this while
I kept myself close, not once daring to stir out of my castle,
any farther than to my lace of observation, near the top of
the hill ; and very glad was to think how well it was forti-
fied. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat
could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I
might be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear
their discourse, if they had any. In the meantime, I fitted
myself up for a battle, as before, thou h with more caution,
knowing I had to do with another kin of enemy than I had
at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent
marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took
myself t'wo fowling-pieces, and I ave him three muskets.
My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; had my formidable goat-
skin coat on, with the great cap I.have mentioned, a naked
sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark ;but about two o'clock, being the heat
of the day, I found, in short, they were all gone straggling into
the woods, and, as I thought, were all laid down to s eep. The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to
get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a
great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and,as I
thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved
to discover myself to them, and learn something of their
condition ; immediately I marched as above, my man Frida
at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as ,
but not making quite so staring a specter-like fi ure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, an then, before
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What
are ye, gentlemen ? " They started up at the noise, but were
ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made. They made no answer at all,butI thought
I perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to
them in English : " Gentlemen, " said I, " do not be surprised
at me : perhaps you may have a friend near, when you did not
expect it." "He must be sent directly from heaven, then, "
said' one of them very gravely to me, and pulling 01f his hat
at the same time ; " for our condition is past the help of man."
"All help is from heaven, sir, " saidI : "but can you put a
stranger in the way to help you? for ou seem to be in some
great distress. I saw you when you anded ; and when you
seemed to make application to the brutes that came with you,
I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you."

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trem-
bling, looked like one astonished, returned, "Am I talkin to
God, or man ? Is it a real man, or an angel? " " Be in no gear
about that, sir," said I ; "if God had sent an angel to relieve
you, he would have come better clothed, and armed after
another manner than you see me in ;pray lay aside your fears ;
I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you ; you
see I have one servant only ; we have arms and ammunition ;
tell us freely, can we serve you ? What is your case ? " " Our
case, sir, " said he, "is too long to tell you, while our murderers
are so near us ; but, in short, snr,_I was commander of that shi ;
my men have mutinied against me ; they have been badly
prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on
shore in this desolate place,with these two men with me--one
my mate, the other a passenger, where we expected to perish,
believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what
to think of it." " \Vhere are these brutes, your enemies?"
said I ; "do you know where they are gone ?" "There they
lie, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; "my heart
trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard on speak ; if
they have, they will certainly murder us all." " gave they any
firearms?" said I. He answered, "The had only two ieces, one
of which they left in the boat." " e11 then," sai I, "leave
the rest to me ; I see they are all asleep ;it is an easy thing to
kill them all ; but shall we rather take them prisoners?" He
told me there were two desperate villains among them that it
was scarce safe to show any mercy to ; but if they were secured,
he believed all the rest would return to their duty. I asked
him which they were. He told me he could not at that dis-
tance distinguish them, but he would obe my orders in any-
thing I would direct. " Well," says I, "let us retreat out of
their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve
further." So they willingly went back with me, till the woods
covered us from them.

"Look you, sir," said I; " if I venture upon your deliver-
ance, are you willing to make two conditions with me!" He

anticipated my proposals by telling me that both he and the
ship, it recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by
me in everything ; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me in what part of the world soever I would
send him ; and the two other men said the same. " Well," said
I, "m conditions are but two ; first,--that while you stay on
this is and with me, you will not pretend to any authority here ;
and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions,
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon
this island, and in the meantime be governed by my orders ;
secondly,--that if the shi is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and my man to ngland passage free."

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of
a man could devise that he would comply with these most
reasonable demands, and besides would owe his life to me, and
acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived, " Well,
then," said I, "here are three muskets for you, with powder
and ball ; tell me next what you think is ro er to be done."
He showed all the testimony of his gratitu e t at he was able,
but offered to be wholly guarded by me. I told himIthought
it was hard venturing an thing ; but the best method I could
think of was to fire on tiem at once as they lay, and if any
were not killed at the first volley, and ofiered to submit, we
might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence
to irect the shot. He said, very modestly, that he was loath to
kill them, if he could help it ; but that those two were incor-
rigihle villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in
the ship, and if they esca ed, we should be undone still, for they
would go on board and ring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all. "Well, then," says I, "necessity 1e itimates
my advice, for it is the only way to save our lives." owever,
seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they
should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake,
and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if
either of them were the men who he had said were the heads of
the mutiny ? He, said, " No." " Well, then," said I, " you
may let them escape ; and Providence seems to have awakened
them on purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, "if the rest
escape you, it is your fault." Animated with this, he took the
musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece in his hand ;
the two men who were with him, going first, made some noise,
at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and
seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late
then, for the moment he cried out they fired--I mean the two
men, the captain wisely reservin his own piece. The bad so
well aimed their shot at the men t iey knew, that one of them was
killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded ; but not
being dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for
help to the other ; but the captain, stepping to him, told him it
was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive
his villainy, and with that word knocked him down with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more : there were
three more in the com any, and one of them was slightly
wounded. By this time i) was come; and when they saw their
danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy.
The captain told them he would spare their lives if they would
give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they

ad been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in
recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the pro-'
testations of their sincerity that could be desired ; and he was
willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not
against, only I obliged him to keep them bound hand and feet
while they were upon the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and brin away the cars
and sails, which they did ; and by and by t ree straggling
men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came
back upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain, who
before Iwas their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted
to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete.

It now remained that the ca tain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances. began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment--and particularly at the wonderful manner of in being
furnished with provisions and ammunition ; and, indee , as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply.

But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more. After this communication was at an end, I carried him
and his two men into my apartments, leading them in just
where I came' out, viz., at the top of the house, where I re-
freshed him with such provision as I had, and showed them
all the contrivances I had made during my long, long inhabit-
ing that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ;
above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how per-
fectly I'had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which,
having been now planted near twenty years, and the trees
growing much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, so thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at
that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage in-
to it. I told him this was my castle and my residence, but
that I had a seat in the country, as most rinces have, whither
I could retreat upon occasion, and I wou (1 show him that too
another time ; but at present our business was to consider how
to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told
me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that
there were still six-aud-twenty hands on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which the had all for-
feited their lives to the law, would he hardene in it now by
desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that if they were
subdued they should be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and that,
therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a

number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it

was a. very rational conclusion, and that therefore something
was to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the men
on board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their
landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this, it presently
occurred to me that in a little while the shi '5 crew, wondering
what was become of their comrades and of t e boat, would cer-
tainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and
that then, perhaps, the might come armed, and be too strong
for us: this he allowe to be rational. Upon this, I told him
the first thing we had to do was tostave the boat, which lay up-
on the beach, so that they might not carry her 01?, and taking
everything out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit
to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the arms which
were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found
there--which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, afew
biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in
a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds) ; all which
was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of
which I had had none left for many years.

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before),
we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry ofi the
boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could
be able to recover the ship ; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, I did not much question to make
her again fit to carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon
our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my
thou hts.

W ile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by
main strength, heaved the. boat upon the beach, so high that
the tide would not float her of at high-water mark, and be-
sides, had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be uickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should 0, we
heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign as
a signal for the boat to come on board : but no boat stirred ;
and they fired several times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and
they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of
my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore ;
and we found, as they approached, that there were no less than
ten men in her, and that they had firearms with them.

As the shi lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a
full view of t em as they came, and a plain sight even of their
faces; because the tide having set them a little to the east of
the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same
place where the ot er had landed, and where the boat lay ; by
this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain
knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of
whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he
was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frightened ; but that as for the boatswain, who
it seems was the chief oflicer among them, and all the rest,
they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no
doubt made des erate in their new enterprise ; and terribly ap-
prehensive was re that they would be too powerful for us. I
smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances
were past the operation of fear ; that seeing almost every
condition that could be was better than that which we were
supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,
whether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I
asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life,
and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.
" And where, sir," said I, " is your belief of my being preserved
here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little.
while ago ? For my part," said I, " there seems to be but one
thing amiss in all the prospect of it." " What is that?" says
he. " Why," said I, "it is, that as you say there are three or
four honest fellows among them, which should be spared, had
they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should have
thought God's providence had singled them out to deliver them
into your hands; for depend upon it, ever man that comes
ashore is our own, and shall die or live as t iey behave to us."
As I s oke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance,
I fouu it greatly encouraged him 3 so we set vigorously to our
business.

We had, upon the first appearance of the boat coming from
the ship, considered of separating our prisoners ; and had, in-
deed, secured them efiectually. Two of them, of whom the
captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday and
one of the three delivered men to my cave, where they were
remote enough, and out of dan er of being heard or discovered,
or of finding their way out o the woods, if they could have
delivered themselves; here they left them bound, but ave
them provisions ; and promised them, if they continued t iere
quietly, to give them their liberty in a da or two ; but that if
they attempted their escape, they should e put to death with-
out mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their confine-
ment with patience, and were very thankful that they had such

ood usage as to have provisions and a light left them: for

'riday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for
their comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sen-
tinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were
kept inioned, indeed, becausevthe captain was not free to
trust t rem ; but the other two were taken into in service, upon
the captain's recommendation, and upon their so emnly engag-
ing to live and die with us ; so with them and the three honest
men we were seven men, well armed ; and I made no doubt
we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were
coming, considering that the captain had said there were three
or four honest men among them also. As soon as they got to
the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat into
the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at anchor some distance from the
shore,with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we should
not be able to seize the boat. Bein on shore, the first thing
they did, they ran all to their other oat ; and it was eas to
see they were under a great sur rise to find her stri pe , as
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or
three great shouts, hallooing With all their might, to try if
they could make their companions hear ; but all was to no pur-
pose : then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of
their small-arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made
the woods rin ; but it was all one; those in the cave, we
were sure, con (1 not hear; and those in our keeping, though
they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they
told-us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to
their ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered,
and the long boat staved ; accordingly, they immediately
launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still
lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recov-
ered ; but he ,was quickly as much frightened the other way.

They had not been long put oif with the boat, when we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again ;but with this new mea-
sure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted together
upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to 0 on
shore, and go up into the country to look for their fel ows.
This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss
what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore would be
no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they
would row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would
be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the shi
would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait an
see what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat
put her OR to a good distance from the shore, and came to an
anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible for us to
come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore kept
close together, marching towards the top of the little hill un-
der which my habitation: lay ; and we could see them plainly,
though they could not perceive us. we should have been
very glad if they would have come nearer to us, so that we
might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther
OE, that we might come abroad. But when they were come
to the brow of the hill where they could see a great way into
the valleys and woods, which lay towards the northeast part,
and where the island lay the lowest, they shouted and hallooed
till the were weary : and not caring, it seems, to venture far
from t 1e shore, nor far from one another, they sat down to-
gether, under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought fit
to have gone to sleep there as the other party of them had
done, they had done the job for us ; but they were too full of
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though
they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear.
The captain made _a very just proposal to me upon this con-
sultation of theirs, viz., that per aps they would all fire a vol-
ley again, to endeavor to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sall upon them just at the juncture when their
pieces were a l discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked this pro-
posal, provided it was done while we were near enough to
come up to them before they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen ; and we lay still a lon time,
very irresolute what course to take. At length, I to] them
there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night ; and
then if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might
find a way to get between them and the shore, and so might
use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on
shore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for
their removing ; and were very uneasy, when, after long con-
sultation, we saw then all start up, and march down towards
the sea: it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
shipI again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on
wit their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as Iperceived them go towards the shore,I im-
agined it to be as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again ; and the captain, as
soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the ap-

rehensions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem to
Y=etch them back again, and which answered my end to a tittle.
I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little
creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on
shore when Friday was rescued, and so soon as they came to
a little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade
them hallo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them ; that as soon as ever they heard the
seamen answer them, they should return it again ; and then
keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when
the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, and
among the woods, as ossible, and then wheel about again to
me by such ways as directed.

They were just going into the boat when Frida and the
mate hallooed ; and they presently heard them, an , answer-
ing, ran alon the shore westward, towards the voice they
heard, when t Iey were presently stopped by the creek, where,
the water being up, they could not get over, and called for
the boat to come u and set them over; as, indeed, I expected.

When they ha set themselves over, I observed that the
boat being gone upa good way into the creek, and, as it were,
in a harbor within the land, they took one of the three men
out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the
boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the
shore. This was what I wished for ; and immediately leaving
Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took the
rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we sur-

rised the two men before they were aware ; one of them ly-
mg on the shore, and the other being in the boat. The fellow
on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start
up ; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked
him down ; and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or
he was a dead man, There needed very few arguments to

ersuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon
liim, and his comrade knocked down : besides, this was, it
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny
as the rest of the crew; and, therefore, was easily persuaded
not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with
us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them,
by hallooing and answering, from one bill to another, and
from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark ; and indeed, they were heartily tired
themselves also, by the time they came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It was several hours after Friday came back to me be-
fore they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long before they came uite up, calling to
those behind to come along ; and could also rear them answer,
and complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to
come any faster: which was very welcome news to us. At
length they came up to the boat: but it is impossible to ex-
press their confusion when they found the boat fast aground
m the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone.
We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted
island ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
allbe murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and
they should be all carried away and devoured. They hallooed
again, and called their two comrades by their names a great
many times; but no answer. After some time, we could see
them, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their
hands'like men in despair, and sometimes they would go and
sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then come ashore
a ain, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.

y men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon
them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take them at
some advantage, so as to stare them, and kill as few of them
as I could ; and especially was unwilling to hazard the killin
any of our men, knowing the others were very well armed.
resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate ; and there-
fore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and
ordered Friday and the ca )tain to cree upon their hands and
feet, as close to the groun as they cou d, that they might not
be discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly, be-
fore the ofiered to fire.

They lad not been long in that posture, when the boatswain,
who was the principal ringleader of the mutin , and had now
shown himself the most dejected and dispirite of all the rest,
came walking towards them, with two more of the crew; the
captain was so eager at having the principal rogue so much in
his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come
so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue
before ; but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was
killed u on the s ot : the next man was shot in the body, and
fell just y him, t rough he did not die till an hour or two after ;
and the third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immedi~
ately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight
men ; viz., myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-gen-
eral ; the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of
war, whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon them,
indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number;
and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now
one of us, call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a
parley, and so perhaps reduce them to terms; which fell out
just as we desired ; for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their
condition then was, they would be very Willing to capitulate.
So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them, "Tom
Smith ! Tom Smith I " Tom Smith answered immediately,
" Who's that? Robinson '1'" for it seems he knew the voice.
The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom Smith,
throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this
moment." " Who must we yield to ? \Vhere are they ?" says
Smith again. " Here they are," says he ; " here's our captain
and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two
hours ; the boatswain is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I
am a prisoner; and if you do not yie <1, you are all lost."
" Will they give us quarter then '1'" says Tom Smith, " and we
will yield." "I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield," said
Robinson so he asked the captain ; and the captain himself
then calls out, " You, Smith, you know my voice ; if on lay
down your arms immediately, and submit, you sha have
your lives, all but Will Atkins."

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, captain,
give me quarter ; what have I done? They have been all as
bad as I : " which, by the way, was not true ; for, it seems, this
Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain,
when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying
his hands, and giving him injurious language. , However, the
captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and
trust to the governor's mercy : by which he meant me, for
they all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down
their arms, and begged their lives; and I sent the man that
had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all ;
and then in great army of fifty men, which, with those three,
were in all ut eight, came up and seized u on them, and upon
their boat ; only that I kept myself an one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat and think of seizing
the ship ; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostnlated with them upon the villainy of their
practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of their

esign, and how certainly it. must bring them to misery and
distress in the end, and perhaps to the allows. They all
appeared very penitent, and begged hard or their lives. As
for that, he told them they were none of his prisoners, but
the commander's of the island; that they thou ht they had
set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited islan ;but it had
pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that
the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them
all there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter,
be supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt
with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was
commanded by the governor to' advise to prepare for death,
that he would be han ed in the morning.

Though this was 9.1 a fiction of his own, yet it had its de-
sired efieet ; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the ca tain to
intercede with the governor for his life; and all t e rest
begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to
Enor and.

D
It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was

come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in ettin possession of the ship; so I
retired in the dark from t em, t at they might not see what
kind of a overnor they had, and called the captain to me;
when I ca led, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the
commander calls for you " ; and presently the captain re lied,
" Tell his Excellency, I am just coming." This more pe ectly
amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was
iust by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me
told him my roject for seizing the ship, which he liked
wonderfully we , and resolved to put it In execution next
morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners,
and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the
worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the
others lay. This was committed to Friday and the two men
who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them to
the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place,
especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered to
my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full descrip-
tion : and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place
was secure enough, considering they were upon their be-
havior. ' ~

To these in the morning Isent the ca tain, who was to
enter into a arley with them; in a wor ,to try them, and
tell me whet er he thought they mi ht be trusted or not to
go on board and surprise the ship. e talked to them of the
injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and
that though the governor had given them quarter for their
lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to
England they would be all hanged in chains ; but that if
they would join in such an attempt as to recover the ship, he
would have the governor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men In their condition ; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest impreca-
tions, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and
that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with
him all over the world ; that they would own him for a father
to them as long as they lived. " \Vell," says the captain, " I
must go and tell the governor what you say, and see what I
can do to bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an
account of the tem er he found them in, and that he verily be-
lieved they won] be faithful. However, that we might be
very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out
five of them, and tell them that they might see that he did not
want men, that he would take out those five to be his assist-
ants, and that the governor would keep the other two and the
three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as
hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that if they Iproved
unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be anged
in chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and con-
vinced them that the governor was in earnest ; however, they
had no way left them but to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much asof the captain, to persuade
the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : first,
the captain, his mate, and passenger; second, then the two
prisoners of the first ang, to whom, having their character
from the captain, I ha iven their libert , and trusted them
with arms ; third, the ot er two whom I ad kept till now in
my bower pinioned, but, upon the captain's motion, had now
re eased ; fourth, these five released at last ; so that they
were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave
for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship ; for as for me and my man Friday,
I did not think it was proper for us to stir, havmg seven men
left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep
them asunder, and supply them with victuals. As to the five
in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went in
twice a day to them, to supp y them with necessaries; and I
made the other two carry provnsions to a certain distance, where
Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had
or ered to look after them; and that it was the overnor's
pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my irection ;
that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle,
and be laid in irons : so that as we never suffered them
to see me as governor, I now appeared as another person, and
spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like,
upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him, buttofnrnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made
his passenger captain of one, with four other men ; and him-
self, his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they
contrived their business very well, for they came up to the
ship about midnight. As soon as they came within call of the
ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had
brought ed the men and the boat, but that it was a long time
before they had found them, and the like ; holding them in a
chat till they came to the shi 's side ; when the captain and
the mate entering first with t eir arms, immediately knocked
down the second mate and carpenter with the butt-end of their
muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men ; they
secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks,
and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were
below ; when the other boat and their men, entering at the
fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle
which went down into the cook-room, making three men they
found there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon
deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who,
having taken the alarm, had got up and with two men and
a boy had got firearms in their hands; and the mate, with a
crow, split open the door, the new ca taiu and his men fired
boldly among them, and wounded t e mate with a musket-
hall, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men,
but killed nobody. The mate, calling for help, rushed, how-
ever, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his

istol shot the new captain through the head, the bullet enter-
ing at his mouth, coming out again behind one of his ears, so
that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest yielded,
land the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives
ost.

As soon as the shi was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fire , which was the signal agreed upon with
me to give me notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I
was very glad to hear, having sat watchingiupon the shore for
it till near two o'clock in the morning. aving thus heard
the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it having been a day
of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something
surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting up,
I heard a man calling me by the name 0 " Governor! Gover-
nor ! " and presently I knew the captain's voice ; when climb-
up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to the ship,
be embraced me in his arms. "My dear friend and deliv-
erer," says he, " there's your ship; for she is all yours, and
so are we, and all that belongs to her." I cast my e es to the
ship, and there she rode, within little more than ha] a mile of
the shore ; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they
were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her
to an anchor just against the mouth of the little creek ; and,
the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near
the place where I first landed my rafts, so landed just at my
door. I was at first ready to sink down with the su rise; for
I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my ands, all
thin 5 easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away
whit er I pleased to go. t first, for some time, I was not
able to answer one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms,
I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the round. He

received the surprise, and immediately pulled a ottle out of
his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had
brought on purpose for me. After I had drunk it, I sat down
upon the ground ; and though it brought me to myself, yet it
was a good while before I could spea a word to him. All
this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only
not under any surprise as I was ; and he said a thousand kind
and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself ;
but such was the flood of joy in my breast that it put all my
s irits into confusion: at last it broke into tears; and, in a
little while after, I recovered my speech ; then I took my turn,
and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together.

I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain
of wonders ; that such things as these were the testimonies we
had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and
an evidence that the eye of an Infinite Power could search in-
to the remotest corner of the world, and send help to the
miserable whenever he pleased. I forgot inot to lift up my
heart in thankfulness to Heaven ; and what heart could for-
bear to bless him, who had not only in a miraculous manner
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance must always be
acknowledged to proceed ?

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshments, such as the ship afiorded,
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters
had not lundered him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the
boat, an bade his men bring the things ashore that were for
the governor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been
one that was not to be carried away along with them, but as
if I had been to dwell upon the island still, and they were to
go without me. First, e had brought me a case of bottles

ull of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira
wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of ex-
cellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef,
and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and abouta hundred-
weight of biscuit; he also brought me a box of sugar,a box
of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice,
and abundance of other things. But besides these, and what
was a thousand times more useful, he brought me six new
clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one
pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good
suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very
little : in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. It was a
very kind and agreeable resent, as any one may imagine, to
one in my circumstances ; ut never was anything in the world
of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to
me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to
consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had ; for it
was worth considering whether we might venture to take
them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom he
knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and
the captain said he knew they were such rogues that there
was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must
be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at
the first English colony he could come at : and I found that
the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I
told hun that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the
two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he
should leave them upon the island. " I should be very glad
of that," says the captain, " with all my heart." " Well," says
I, " I will send for them up, and talk with them for you." So I
caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now dis.
char ed, their comrades having performed their promise; I
say, caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five
men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep t em there
till I came. After some time,I came thither dressed in my
new habit ; and now I was called governor again. Being all
met, and the captain with me,I caused the men to be brought
before me, and I told them I had got a full account of their
villainous behavior to the captain, and how they had run
away with the shi , and were preparing to commit further
robberies, but that rovidence had ensnared them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had
dug for others. I let them know that by my direction the
ship had been seized ; that she lay now in the road ; and they
might see by and by that their new captain had received the
reward of his villainy, for that they might see him hangin at
the yard-arm ; that, as to them, I wanted to know what t ey
had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken in
the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had
authority to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when the were taken the
captain promised them their lives, and they umbly implored
my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show
them ; for as for in self I had resolved to quit the island
with all in men, and had taken passage with the captain to go
to Englan ; and as for the captain,he could not carry them to
En land other than as risoners in irons,to be tried for mutin ,
an running away with) the ship; the consequence of whic ,
they must needs know, would be the gallows ; so that I could
not tell what was the best for them, unless they had a mind
to take their fate in the island. If they desired that, I did
not care ;as I had liberty to leave it, I had some inclination
to give them their lives,if they thought the could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it, an said the would
much rather venture to stay there than be carried to ngland
to be hanged. So I left it on that issue.

However, the ca tain seemed to make some dilficulty of it,
as if he durst not eave them there. Upon this I seemed a
little angry with the captain, and told him that the were my
prisoners, not his ; and, that seeing I had ofiere them so
much favor, I would be as good as my word ; and that if he
did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty,
as I found them ; and if he did not like it, he might take them
again if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very
thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them
retire into the woods, to the place whence they came and I
would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, and some di~
rections how they should live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship ; but told the
captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and de.
sired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all right
in the shi), and send the boat on shore next day for me;
orderin im, in the meantime, to cause the new captain, who
was kil ed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men
mi ht see him.

hen the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me in my
apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them of
their circumstances. I told them I thought they had made a
right choice ; but if the captain had carried them away, they
would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain
hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I told
them I would let them into the story of my living there, and
put them into the way of making it easy to them. Accord-
ingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, and of my
commg to it ; showed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes, and, in a word,
all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the
story also of the sixteen Spaniards, that were to be expected,
for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them
in common with themselves.

I left them my firearms, viz., five muskets, three fowling-
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of
powder left ; for after the first year or two I used but little,
and wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I
managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them,
and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them
every part of my story ; and told them I should prevail with
the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and
some garden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very
glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of peas which the captain
had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and in-
crease them.

Having done all this, I left the next day, and went on board
the ship. We prepared immediately to sail,but did not weigh
that ni ht. The next morning early, two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's side, and made the most lamentable
complaint of the other three, he ged to be taken into the ship
for God's sake, for they should e murdered, and begged the
captain to take them on board, though be hanged them
immediately. Upon this, the captain pretended to have no
power without me ; but after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on board,
and were, some time after, soundly whipped and pickled ; after
which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men ; to which
the captain, at my intercessron, caused their chests and clothes
to be added, which the took, and were very thankful for. I
also encouraged them, y telling them that if it la in my way
to send an vessel to take them in I would not orget them.

When took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goatskin cap I had made, m umbrella, and
one of my parrots; also I forgot not to ta e the mone I
formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long useless t lat
it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for,

silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, and also the
money I found in the wreck of the Spanish shi . And thus I
left the island, the 19th of December, as I foun by the ship's
account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days ; being delivered
from this second captivity the same day of the month that
I first made my esca e in the long boat from among the
Moors of Sallee. In t is vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived
in England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been
thirty-five years absent.

When I came to England, I was a perfect stranger to all
the world, as if I had never been known there. My benefactor
and faithful steward, whom I had left my mone in trust
with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in t e world ;
was become a widow the second time, and very low in the
world. I made her easy as to what she owed me, assuring her
I would ive her no trouble ; but, on the contrary, in gratitude
for her ormer care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as
my little stock would afford ; which at that time would, in-
deed, allow me to do but little for her: but I assured her I
would never forget her former kindness to me ; nor did I for-

et her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be observed
in its place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct,
except that I found two sisters and two of the children of one
of my brothers 3 and as I had been long ago given over for
dead, there had been no provision made for me ; so that, in a
word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that little
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the
world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I
had so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the
ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the
owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men
and the ship, they invited me- to meet them and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a very hand-
some compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost
PS200 sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances
of my life, and how little way this would go towards settling
me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might
not come by some information of the state of my plantation in
the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who,I
had reason to suppose, had some years now given me over for
dead. With this View I took shipping for Lisbon, where I
arrived in April following ; my man Friday accompanying me
very honestly in all these ramblings, and provin a most faithful
servant upon all occasions. When I came to isbon, I found
out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old
friend, the captain of the ship who first took me up at sea olf
the shore of Africa, He was now grown old, and had left
the sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man,
into his shi , and who still used the Brazil trade. 'lhe old
man did not now me ; and indeed, I hardly knew him. But
I soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him
who I was.

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance
between us I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation
and my artner. The old man told me he had not been in
the Blame for about nine years; but that he could assure me,
that when he came away my partner was living; but the
trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of
my art, were both dead; that, however, he believed that I
won d have a ver good account of the improvement of the
plantation ; for t iat, upon the general belief of my being cast
away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of
the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-
fiscal, who had a propriated it, in case I never came to claim it,
one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monaste of St.
Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the nor an for the
conversion of the Indians to the Catholic fait ; but that if
I appeared, or an one for me, to claim the inheritance, it
would be restore ; only that the. im rovement, or annual
production, being distributed to charita 1e uses, could not be
restored; but he assured me that the steward of the kin 's
revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward of t e
monastery, had taken great care all along that the incumbent,
that is to say, my partner, ave every year a faithful account,
of the produce, of which t ey had received duly my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had
brought the plantation, and whether he thought it mi ht be
worth looking after ; or whether, on my going thit er, I
should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiet . He told me he could not tell exactly to
w at degree the p antation was improved ; but this he knew,
that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying
but one half of it ; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he
had heard that the king's third of my part, which was, it
seems, granted away to some other monastery or religious
house, amounted to above two hundred moidores a year: that
as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was
no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to
witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the
register of the country; also he told me that the survivors of
my two trustees were very fair, honest peo 1e, and very
wealthy ; and he believed I would not only have t eir assistance
for putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable
sum of money in their hands for my account, being the prod ace
of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it
was given up, as above ; which, as he remembered, was for
about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the
trustees should thus dis ose of my effects, when he knew that
I had made my will, and ad made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universal heir, etc.

He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some
certain account should come of my death ; and that besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote ; that
it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim ;
and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive,
he would have acted b procuration, and taken possession of
the in enio (so they ca 1 the sugar-house), and have iven his
son, w 0 was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. " ut," says
the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell you, which per-
ha 3 may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and that is,
hefieving you were lost, and all the world believing so also,
your partner and trustees did ofier to account with me, in
your name, for the first six or eight years' profits, which I re-
ceived. There being at that time great disbursements for in-
creasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it
did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced:
however," says the old man, " I shall give you a true account
of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it."

After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend,
he brought me an account of the first six years' income of my
plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant-trustees,

eing always elivered in goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, etc., which is the consequence
of a sugar-'work ; and I found by this account, that every year
the income considerably increased ; but, as above, the disburse-
ments being large, the sum at first was small ; however, the
old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and
seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of su er, and
fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his s ip ; he
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about e even
years after my leaving the place. The good man then began
to complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged
to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a
share in new ship. " Howeverhmy old friend," says he, " you
shall not want a supp] in your necessity, and as soon as my
son returns you shal e fully satisfied." Upon this he pulls
out an old pouch, and ives me one hundred and sixty Portugal
moidores in old; and giving me the writings of his title
to the ship, w rich his son was one to the Brazlls in, of which
he was quarter-part owner, an his son another, he puts them
both in my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of
the poor man to be able to bear this ; and remembering what
he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain
weeping at what he had said to me ; therefore, first, I asked
him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money
at that time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he
could not say but it might straiten him a little ; but, however,
it was my money, and I might want it more than he.

Everything the good man said was full of afi'ection, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke: in short, I
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for 8. en and
ink to give him a receipt for them ; then I returned rim the
rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the lantation I
would return the other to him also (as, indeed, afterwards
did) ; and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship,
I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the
money, I found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to ex-
pect, I would never have a penny more from him.

When this was past, the old man began to ask me if he
should put me into a method to make my claim to my lanta-
tion. told him I thought to go over to it myself. c said
I might do so if I pleased ; but that, if I did not, there were
ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appro-
priate the rofits to my use : and as there were ships in the
river of Lis on just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me
enter my name in a ublic register, with his afiidavit, afiirm-
ing, 11 on oath, that was alive, and that I was the same per-
son w ,0 took up the land for the planting the said plantation
at first. This being regularly attested by a notary, and a ro-
curation aflixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter 0 his
writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place ; and
then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the
return.

Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I re-
ceived a Iar e packet from the survivors of my trustees, the
merchants, or whose account I went to sea, in which were the
following particular letters and papers inclosed.

First, there was the account-current of the produce of m
farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had ba -
anced With my old Portugal captain, being for six years ; the
balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favor.

Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while
they kept the efiects in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a erson not
to be found, which they called civil death ; and the alance of
this, the value of the lantation increasing, amounted to nine-
teen thousand four undred and forty-six crusadoes, being
about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores.

Thirdly, there was the Prior of the Augustines' account,
who had received the profits for above fourteen years ; but not
being to account for what was displosed of by the hospital,
very honestly declared he had eight undred and seventy-two
mordores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my ac-
count ; as to the kin 's part, that refunded nothing.

There was also alletter of my partner's, congratulating me
very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account
how the estate was improved, and what it produced a year;
with the particulars of the number of squares or acres t at it
contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it :
and making two-and-twenty crosses for blessin s, told me he
had said so many Ave Marius to thank the lglessed Virgin
that I was alive ; inviting me very passionately to come over
and take possession of in own ; and, in the meantime, to give
him orders to whom he s ould deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself ; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend-
ship, and that of his fannl ; and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leo ards' skins, whic he had, it seems, receiVed from
Africa, y some other ship that he had sent thither, and which,
it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also
live chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of
gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same
fleet, my two merchant-trustees ship ed me one thousand two
hundred chests of sugar, eight hun red rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in old.

I might well say now, indeed,t at the latter end of Job was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutter-
ings of my ver heart when I looked over these letters, and es-
pecially when found all my wealth about me ; for, as the Brazil
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my let-
ters brought my goods : and the efiects were safe in the river
before the letters came to my hand. In a word I turned ale,
and grew sick ; and, had not the old man run and fetche me
a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset na-
ture, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that, I contin-
ued very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent
for, and somethin of the real cause of m illness being known,
he ordered me toit blood ; after which Ihad relief, and grew
well : but I verily believe, if I had not been eased by the vent
given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above fifty thousand
pounds sterlinor in money, and had an estate, as I might well
call it, in the ISA-azils, of above a; thousand pounds a ear, as
sure as an estate of lands in England; and, in a wor , I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how
to compose myself for the enjoyment of. The first thing I did
was to recom ense my original benefactor, my good old cap-
tain, who had een first charitable to me in my distress, kind
to me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed
him all that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the
providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was owin
to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
would do a hundred-fold ; so I first returned to him the hun-
dred moidores I had received of him, then I sent for a notary
and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge
from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had ac-
knowledged he owed me, in fullest and firmest manner possi-
ble. After which, I caused a procuration to be drawn, em-
powering him to be the receiver of the annual profits of my
plantation; and appointing my partner to account him, and
make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and
by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores
a year to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moi-
dores a year to his son after him, for his life : and thus I re-
quited my old man.

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into In hands ; and indeed, I had more care upon my head now
than had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my
business was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to hide
my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or ke ,
till it ew moldy and tarnished before anybody would me -
dle wit it; on'the contrar , I knew not where to put it. My
old patron, the captain, in eed, was honest, and that was the
only refuge I had. In the next 'place, my interest in the Bra-
zils seemed to summon me thit er; but now I could not tell
how to think of going thither till I had settled my afiairs, and
left my efiects in some safe hands behind me. At first I
thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest,
and would be just to me ; but then she was in years, and but
poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt; so that, in a
word, I had no wa but to go back to England myself, and
take my efiects wit me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to
his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I be-

an to think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my
first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faith-
ful steward and instructor. So, the first thin I did, I got a
merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspon ent in London
not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I
lived, have a further supply : at the same time, I sent my two
sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they being,
though not in want, yet not in vel good circumstances; one
having been married and left a Wi ow ; and the other havin
a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But, among afi
my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet 1pitch u on one
to whom I durst commit the gross of my stoc ,that might
go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me ; and
this greatly perplexed me. '

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the
place ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion,
which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall say more pres-
ently. However, it was not religion that kept me from oing
there for the present; and as I had made no scru 1e of eing
openly of the religion of the country all the while was among
them, so neither did I yet ; only that, now and then, having
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to
think of living and dying among them, I began to regret my
having professed myself a Papist, and thought It might not
be the best religion to die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brazils, but that really I di not know
with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I resolved at
last to go to England with them, where, if I arrived, I con-
cluded I should make some acquaintance, or find some relations,
that would be faithful to me ; and, accordingly, I prepared to
go to England with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the
Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of thin s I had from
thence ; and, first, to the Prior of St. Augustine, wrote a let-
ter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundre and seventy-two to the poor, as
the prior should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers for
me, and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two
trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much justice
and honesty called for: as for sending them any present, they
were far above having any occasion of it. Lastly, I wrote to
my partner, acknowledging his industry in the improving the
plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of works;
givin him instructions for his future government of my part,
aecor in to the powers I had left with my old patron, to
whom I desired him to send whatever became due to me, till
he should hear from me more particularly; assuring him that
it was my intention not only to come to him, but to settle my-
self there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a.
very handsome resent of some Italian silks for his wife and
two daughters, or such the captain's son informed me he had :
with two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could
get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders
lace of a good value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned
all-my effects into good ills of exchange, my next difficulty
was which way to go to England. I had been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet I had a stran e aversion to go to
England by sea at that time ; and though could give no reason
for it, at the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though l had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and that
might be one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment ; two of
the shi s which I had singled out to go in--I mean, more par-
ticular y singled out than any other--having put my things on
board one 0 them, and in the other having agreed with the
captain, I say two of these shi s miscarried ; viz., one was taken
by the Algerines, and the ot er was cast away on the Start,
near Torbay, and all the eople drowned, except three ; so that
in either of those vessels?! had been made miserable, in which
most, it was hard to say. '

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to
whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to
go b sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over
the ay of Biscay to Roche 1e, from whence it was but an easy
and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover ;
or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land through
France. In a word, I was so pre ossessed a ainst my going by
sea at all, except from Calais to over, that% resolved to travel
all the we by land ; which," I was not in haste, and did not
value the c arge, was by much the pleasanter way : and to make
it more so, In old oa tain brou ht an En lish gentleman, the
son of a mere ant infirisbon, who was wi ling to travel with
me; after which we icked up two more English merchants
also, and two young ortuguese gentlemen, the last oing to
Paris only ; so that in all there were six of us, and ve ser-
vant; the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting
themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge ;
and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger
to 3e capable of supplying the place of a servant upon the
roa .

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our com any be-
ing ver well mounted and armed, we made a litt e troop,
whereo they did me the honor to call me captain, as well be-
cause I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and,
indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journeys, so I
shall trouble you now with none of my land journeys ; but some
adventures that happened to us in this tedious and difiieult
journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain,
and what was worth observing ; but,it being the latter part of
the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about

4'
the middle of October ; but when we came to the edge of
Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with
an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of
the mountains that several travelers were obliged to come
back to Pampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme
hazard to pass on.

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed ;
and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to
countries where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold
was insufferable ; nor, indeed, was it more painful than it was
surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile,
where the weather was not on] warm, but very hot, and im-
mediately to feel a wind from t ePyrenean Mountains so very
keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
bennmbing and perishing of our fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really fri htened when he saw the mountains
all covered with snow, an felt cold weather, which he had
never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the matter, after
we came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much vio-
lence, and so long, that the people said winter was come before
its time ; and the roads, which were diflicult before, were now

uite impassable ; in a word, the snow lay in some places too
t ick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case
in the northern countries, there was no goin without being
in danger of being buried alive every step. e stayed no less
than twenty days at Pampeluna ; when (seeing the winter com-
ing on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the sever-
est winter all over Europe that had been known in many years)
I proposed that we should 0 away to Fontarabia, and there take
shipping for Bordeaux, w ich was a very little vo age. But,
while I was considering this, there came in four rench gen-
tlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide,
who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the mountains by such ways that they
were not much incommoded with the snow ; for where they
met with snow in any quantit , they said it was frozen hard
enough to hear them and t eir horses. We sent for this
guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same
way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed
sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts ; for, he
said, in these great snows, it was frequent for some wolves to
show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made
ravenous for want of food, the round being covered with
snow. We told him we were wellgenough prepared for such
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of
two-legged wolves, which,we were told, we were in most dan-
ger from, espiecially on the French side of the mountains. He
satisfied us t at there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to go ; so we readily agreed to follow him, as
did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some
French, some S anish, who, as I said, had attempted to go,
and were obliged to come back again.

Accordin l , we set out from Pam eluna with our guide on
the 15th of ovember ; and, indeedflwas sur rised, when, in-
stead of dgoing forward, he came directly bac with us on the
same roa that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles;
when, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain coun-
try, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the
country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but, on a sud-
den, turning to his left, he approached the mountains another
way ; and though it is true the hills and preci ices looked
dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such mean ers, and led
us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height
of the mountains without being much encumbered with the
snow; and, all of a sudden, he showed us the leasant and
fruitful provinces of Lan uedoc and Gascony,al green and
flourishing, though, indee ,they were at a great distance, and
we had some rough way to pass still.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ;
but he bid us be easy ; we should soon be past it all : we found,
indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before 3 and so, depending upon our guide, we
went on.

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way
adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and, had he been far before us he would have been de-
voured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened
upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such vio-
lence that he had not time or presence of mind enough to draw
his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My
man Friday being next me, I bade him ride up and see what
was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the man,
he hallooed outas loud as the other," 0h, master! Oh, master l"
but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the man, and with
his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday;
for, having been used to such creatures in his count , he had
no fear upon him, but went close u to him and .shot him;
whereas, any other of us would have red at a farther distance,
and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered shoot-
inrr the man. ,

33m; it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I;
and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal
howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of
the mountains, that it was to us as if there had been a prodig-
ious number of them ; and perhaps there was not such a few
as that we had no cause of a prehension ; however, as Friday
had killed this wolf, the other, that had fastened upon the
horse, left him immediate] , and fled, without doing him any
damage, having happil astened upon his head, where the
bosses of the bridle ha stuck in his teeth. But the man was
most hurt ; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in
the arm, and the other time a little above his knee ; he was
just, as it were, tumbling down by the disorder of his horse,
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which
was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the
matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded
us before, we saw plainly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.

But never was alight managed so hardily, and in such a sur-
prising manner, as tiat whic followed between Friday and
the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were sur rised
and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable. the
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the
wolf does, which is swrft and light, so he has two particular
qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions ; first, as
to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually at-
tempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excess-
ively hungry, which it is robable might now he the case, the
ground being covered wit: snow), if you do not meddle with
him, he will not meddle with you ; but then you must take
care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is
a very nice gentleman ; he will not go a step out of his way
for a prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to
look another way and keep going on ; for sometimes If you
stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it
for an affront ; but if you throw or toss anything at him, and
it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your
fin er, he takes it for an aifront, and sets all other busmess
aside to pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point
of honor--that is his first quality ; the next is, that if he be
once alfronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he
has had his revenge, but follow at a good round rate till he
overtakes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came
up to him, he was helping him off from his horse, for the man
was both hurt and frightened, and indeed the last more than
the first, when on a su den we espied the bear come out of the
wood, and a vast, monstrous one it was, the biggest by far
that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw
him; but when Friday saw him it was easy to see joy and
eoura e in {the fellow's countenance. "Oh, oh, oh," says Fri-
day, t ree times, pointin to him ; " oh, master ! you give me
te leave, me shakee te and with him ; me make you good
lau h."

Igwas surprised to see the fellow so pleased. "You fool,"
said I, " he will eat you up."--"Eatee me up ! eatee me up ! "
says Friday, twice over again ; ',' me eatee him up ; me makee

on good laugh ; you all stay here, me show you good laugh."
$0 down he sits, and gets his boot off in a moment, and puts
ona air of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear, and
which he had in his pocket),gives my other servant his horse,
and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on, and ofl'ered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him, " Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday,
" me speakee with you." We followed at a distance, for
now, being come down to the Gascony side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast, great forest, where the country was
plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scat-
tered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels
of the bear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great
stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but
did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a
wall ; but it answered Friday's end, for the to ue was so void
of fear that he did it purely to make the bear ollow him, and
show us some laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt
the stone, and saw him, he turns about, and came after him,
taking very long strides, and shuflling on at a strange rate, so
as would have put a horse to a middling gallop; away runs
Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help ;
so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my
man; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the
hear back upon us, when he was going about his own business
another way ; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear u on us, and then run away ; and I called out, " You
do ! " sai I, "is this your making us laugh I Come away,
an take your horse, that we may shoot the creature." He
heard me, and cried out, " No shoot, no shoot; stand still, ou
get much laugh"; and as the nimble creature ran two eet

or the beast's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us,
and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned us
to follow ; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree,
laying his gun down upon the round at about five or six yards
from the bottom of the tree. g:i'he bear soon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance ; the first thing he did he
stopped at the un, smelled at it, but let it lie, and up he
scrambles into t e tree, climbing like a cat, though so mon-
strous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of
my man, and could not for my life see anythin to laugh
at hyet, till seeing the bear get 'up the tree, we a rode near
to im.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the
small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about
half wa to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part
where t e limb of the tree was weake1---" Ha 1" says he to us,
" now you see me teachee the bear dance " ; so he began
jumping) and shakin the bough, at which the bear began to
totter, ut stood sti I, and began to look behind him, to see
how he should get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily.
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal ; when see-
ing him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had
supposed the bear could speak English, " What, you no come
fart er? pray you, come farther" ; so he left Jumping and
shaking the bough; and the bear, just as if he had under-
stood what he said, did come a little farther ; then he began
jumping a ain,and the bear stopped aglain. We thou ht now
was a goo time to knock him on the ead, and calle to Fri-
day to stand still, and we would shoot the bear ; but he cried
out earnestly, " Oh, pray! oh, pray ! no shoot, me shoot by and
then "; he would have said by and by. However, to shorten
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so tick-
lish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not
imagine what the fellow would do; for first we thought he
depended upon shakin the bear off ; and we found the hear
was too cunning for t at too; for he would not go out far
enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with great broad
claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be
the end of it, and what the jest would be at last. But Friday
put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to
the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come
any farther, " Well, well," says Friday, " you no come farther,
me go ; you no come to me, me come to you " ; and upon this
he went out to the smaller .end of the bou h, where it would
bend with his weight, and gently let himse down by it, slid-
ing down the bough till he came near enough to jum down
on his feet, and awa he ran to his gun, took it up, an stood
still. " Well," said to him, " Friday, what will you do now !
Why don't you shoot him !"--" No shoot," says Friday,
"no yet; me shoot now, me no kill ; me sta , give you one
more laug " ; and, indeed, so he did, as you w' lsee presently;
for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back
from the bough where he stood, but did it ver cautiously,
looking behind him every step, and coming bac ward till he
got into the body of the tree ; then, with the same hinder end

oremost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws,
and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this junc-
ture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his
piece mto us ears, and shot him dead as a stone. Then the
rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and when he
saw we were pleased, by our looks, he began to laugh very
loud. " So we killed bear in my country," says Friday. "So
you kill them ? " says I; " why, you have no guns."--" No,"
says he, " no gun, but shoot great much long arrow." This was
a good diversion to us ; but we were still in a wild place, and
our guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardl knew;
the howling of wolves ran much in my head ; and in eed, ex-
cept the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of. which I
have said something already, Inever heard anything that filled
me with so much horror.

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or
else, as Friday would have rad us, we should certainly have
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth
saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide
hastened us; so we'left him, and went forward on our jour-

ne .

g'he ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous crea-
tures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest
and lain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and
had one a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they
surprised the country people, killing a reat many of their
sheep and horses, and some people too. e had one danger-
ous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were more
wolves in the country we should find them there; and this
was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a
long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get
through the wood, and then we :should come to the village
where we were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sun-
set when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when
we came into the plain ; we met nothing in the first wood, ex-
cept that in a little plain within the wood, which was not
above two fur-longs over, we saw five great wolves cross the
road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of
us, and were one out of sight in a few moments. U on this, our
guide, who, y the way, was a faint-hearted fel ow, bid us

eep in a ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves
a-coming. . e kept our arms ready and our eyes about us ;
but we saw no more wolves till we came throu h that wood,
which was near a half a league, and entered t 1e plain. As
soon as we came into' the plain, we had occasion enough to
look about us: the first object we met with was a dead horse;
that is to say a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at
least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating him,
but picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the
flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at their
feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not sufler him by any
means ; for I found we were like to have more business u on
our hands than we were aware of. We had not gone alf
over the plain, when we began to hear the wolves howl in the
wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after we
saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a
body, and mostof them in a line as regularly as an army drawn up
by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to receive
them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only
way ; so we formed in a moment ; but that we might not
have too much interval, I ordered that only every other man
should fire, and that the others, who had not fired, should
stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if they
continued to advance upon us ; and then that those who had
fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees again,
but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed
with a fusee and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were, by
this method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time;
however, at present we had no necessity ; for upon firing the
first volley, t ie enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well
with the noise as with the fire. Four of them being shot in
the head, dropped ; several others were wounded, and went
bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I found they stopped,
but did not immediately retreat ; Whereupon, remembering
that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were terri-
fied at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to haloo
as loud as we could ; and I found the notion not alto ether
mistaken ; for upon our shout they began to retire an turn
about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their
rear, which ut them to the gallop, and away they went to
the woods. his gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ;
and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had
but little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in
readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on
our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way we
were to go. .

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it the worse on our side ; but the noise increasing,
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling
of those hellish creatures ; and, on a sudden, we perceived two
or three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and
one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with
them ; however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way
forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the
way being very rough, was only a good hard not In this
manner, we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through
which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain ; but
we were greatly surprised when, coming nearer the lane or pass,
we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the en-
trance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a
horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind,
and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him full speed. Indeed,
the horse had the advantage of them ; but as we su pose that
he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but t 1ey would
get up with him at last: and no question but they did.

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for, riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcases of
another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous crea-
tures; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we
heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off ;
but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body
were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of rey; and I
verily believe there were t ree hundred of them. thappened,
very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood,
but a little way from it, there lay some large timber trees,
which had been cut down the summer before, and I sup ose
lay there for carriage. I drew my little troo in among t ose
trees, and placing ourselves in a ine behin one long tree, I
advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for
a breastwork, to stand in a trianale, or three fronts, inelosing
our horses in the center. We di 50, and it was well we did ;
for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made
upon us in this place. They came on us with a growlin kind
0 a noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as said,
was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their
prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally oc-
casioned by their seeing our horses behind us, which was the
prey they aimed at. I ordered our men to fire as before, every
other man ; and they took their aim so sure that indeed they
killed several of the wolves at the first volle ; but there was
a necessity to keep a continual firing, for t ey came on like
devils, those behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusils, we thought
they stopped a little, and I ho ed they would have gone ofi, but
it was but a moment, for at ers came forward again; so we
fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four
firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamcd
twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loth to spend
our last shot too hastily; so I called my servant--not my man
Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest dex-
terity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while
we were engaged--but, as I said, I called my other man, and
giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all along
the iece of timber and let it be a lar e train. He did so, an
had at just time to get away, when t e wolves came up to it,
and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol
close to the powder, set it on fire ; those that were upon the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, 01'
rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the
fire: we dispatched these in an instant, and the rest were so
frightened with the light, which the night--for it was now very
dark--made more terrible, that they drew back a little ; upon
which I ordered our last pistols to be fired ofi in one volley, and
after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned~tail,
and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones that
we found strugglin on the ground, and fell to cuttin them
with our swords, wfiich answered our expectation, for t e cry-
ing and howling they made was better understood by their
fellows; so that they all fled and left us.

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and
had it been daylight we had killed many more. The field of
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had
still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures
bowl and yell in the woods as we went, several times, and
sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow
dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. So in about an hour
more we came to the town where we were to lodge, which we
found in a. terrible fright, and all in arms ; for it seems that
the night before the wolves and some bears had broke into the
village and put them in such terror that they were obliged
to keep guard night and day, but especially in the night,
to reserve their cattle, and indeed their peo le.

he next morning our guide was so ill, an hislimbs swelled

so much with the ranklin of his two wounds, that he could go
no farther ; so we were 0 li ed to take a new guide here, and
go to Toulouse, where we iund a warm climate,a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like
them ; but when we told ourstory at Toulouse, they told us it
was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the
foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the
ground ; but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had
got, who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe
season, and told us it was surprisin we were not all devoured.
When we told them how we place ourselves and the horses
in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was
fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight
of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their
rey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun ;
ut being excessively hun ry, and raging on that account, the
eagerness to come at theSSiorses had made them senseless of
dancer ; and that if we had not, by the continued fire, and at
lastzby the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it
had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces;
whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback,
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as
'otherwise; and, withal, they told us that at last, if we had
stood all together, and left our horses, they would have been
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come ofi
safe, especially having our firearms in our hands, and being so
many in number. For my part, I was never so sensible of
danger in my life ; for, seeing above three hundred devils
come rearing and open-mouthed to devour' us, and having
nothing to shelter us or retreat to,I gave myself over for lost;
and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those
mountains again ; I think I would much rather go a thousand
leagiies by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a
wee .

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France--nothing but what other travelers have given
an account of with much more advantage than I can. I
traveled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any considerable
stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th of
January, after having a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the center of my travels, and had in a
little time all In new discovered estate. safe about me, the bills
of exchange w ich I brought with me having been very
currently paid.

My principal guide and privy counselor was my good
ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent
her, thought no pains too much, nor care too great, to emplo
for me ; and I trusted her so entirely with everything, that
was perfectly easy as to the security of my efl'ects ; and, indeed,
I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in
the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now,having resolved to dispose of my plantation in
the Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having
ofiered it to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees,
who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the offer, and remitted
thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent
me the bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred

ieces of eight for the estate, reserving the ayment of one

undred moidores a year to him (the 01 man; during his life,
and fifty moidores afterwards to his son {or his life, which I
had promised them, and which the lantation was to make
good as a rent--charge. And thus I ave given the first part
of a life of fortune and adventure--a life of Providence's
chequer--work, and of a variety which the world will seldom
be able to show the like of--beginning foolishly, but closing
much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so
much as to hope for.

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good
fortune I was past running any more hazards : and so, indeed,
I had been, if other circumstances had concurred ; but I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not
keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be
upon the wing again ; especially, I could not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the oor
Spaniards were in being there. My true friend, the wi ow,
earnestly dissuaded me rom it, and so far prevailed with me
that for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad,
during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one
of my brothers, into my care ; the eldest, havingl something
of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave im a settle-
ment of some addition to his estate after my decease. The
other I , laced with the captain of a ship; and, after five
ears, fin ing him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow,
put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this
young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther
adventures myself.

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here ; for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvanta e or
dissatisfaction, and had three children, two sons an one
daughter; but my wife dying, and m nephew coming home
with good success from a voyage to pain,m inclination to
go abroad, and his importunit , prevailed, an engaged me to
go in his ship as a private tra er to the East Indies ; this was
in the year 1694. .

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island ; saw
my successors, the Spaniards; had the whole story of their
lives, and of the villains I left there ; how at first the insulted
the poor Spaniards; how they afterwards agreed, isagreed,
united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged
to use violence with them; how they were subjected to the
Spaniards; how honestly the S amards used them--a his-
tory, if it were entered into, as fu l of variety and wonderful
accidents as in own part; particularly, also, as to their battles
with the Carib cans, who landed several times upon the island,
and as to the im rovement they made upon the island itself
--and how five 01fJ them made an attempt upon the mainland,
and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, by
which, at my coming,I found about twenty young children on
the island.

Here I stayed about twenty days--left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes,
tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England with
Die--viz., a carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, re-
served to myself the property of the whole, but gave them
such parts respectively as they a reed on ; and havmg settled
all things with them, and engage them not to leave t e place,
I left them there.

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a
bark, which I bought there, with more people to the island ;
and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being
such as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to
send them some women from England, with a good cargo of
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting--
which I afterwards could not perform. The fellows proved
very honest and diligent after they were mastered, and had
their properties set apart for them. I sent them, also, from
the Brazils, five cows, three of them being big with calf, some
sheep, some hogs, which when I came again were considerably
increased.

But all these things, with an account how three hundred
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations,
and how they fought with that whole number twice and were
at first defeated, and one of them killed; but, at last, a storm
destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession
of their plantation, and still lived upon the island--all these
things, With some very surprising incidents in some new ad-
ventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a further
account of in the Second Part of my history.

 

PART II.

THAT homel proverb, used on so many occasions in En-
gland, viz., " hat what is bred in the bone will not go out of
the dos ," was never more verified than in the story of my
life. Any one would think that after thirty-five years' afflic-
tion, and a variety of unhappy circumstances, which few men,
if any, ever went through before, and after near seven years of
peace and enjoyment in the fullness of all things, grown old,
and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have had expe~
hence of every state of middle life, and to know which was
most adapted to make a man completely happy; I say, after
all this, any one would have thought that the native propensity
to rambling, which I gave an account of in my first setting
out in the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts,
should be worn out, the volatile part be fully evacuated, or at
least condensed, and I might, at sixty-one years of age, have
been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing
life and fortune any more.

Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was
taken awa in me, for I had no fortune to make ; Ihad nothing to
seek : if had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no
richer ; for I had already sufficient for me, and for those I had
to leave it to; and what I had was visibly increasin ; for
having no great family, I could not spend the income 0 what
I had, unless I would set up for an expensive way of living,
such as a great famil , servants, eguipage, gayety, and the like,
which were things had no notion of, or inclination to; so
that I had nothin , indeed, to do but to sit still, and fully enjoH
whatI had got, an see it increase daily upon my hands. Yeta
these things had no effect upon me, or at least not enough to
resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which
hung about me like a chronical distem er. In particular, the
desire of seeing my new plantation in t e island, and the colony;
I left there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed of it a
night, and my imagination ran upon it all day ; it was upper-
most in all my thoughts ; and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep ; in short, nothing
could remove it out of my mind. It even broke so violently
into all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome,
for I could talk of nothing else ; all my discourse ran into it,
even to irn ertinence ; and I saw it in self.

I have 0 ten heard persons of goo judgment say, that all
the stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions
is owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful opera-
tion of fancy in their minds ; that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking ; that people's poring af-
fectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased
friends, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancy-
ing, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see them,
talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, there
is nothin but shadow and vapor in the thing, and they really
know not ing of the matter.

For my part, Iknow not to this hour whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, specters, or walking of people
after they are dead; or whether there is an thing in the
stories the tell us of that kind more than the product of
vapors, sic minds, and wandering fancies ; but this I know,
that my imagination worked up to such a height, and brou ht
me into such excess of va ms, or what else I may call it, t rat
Iactually supposed mysel often upon the s ot, at my old castle,
behind the trees ; saw my old Spaniard, riday's father, and
the reprobate sailors I left 11 on the island ; nay, I fancied I
talked with them, and looke at them steadily, though I was
broad awake, as at persons just before me ; and this I did till I
often frightened myself with the images my fancy represented
to me. ne time, In my slee , I had the Vlllainy of the three

irate sailors so lively relate to me by the first Spaniard and

riday's father, that it was surprising ; the told mehow they
barbarously attempted to murder all the paniards, and that
they set fire tothe rovisions they had laid up, on purpose to
distress and starve t rem ; things that I had never heard of, and
that, indeed, were never all of them true in fact : but it was
so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me, that, to the
hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was, or
would be, true; also how I resented it, when the Spaniard
complained to me ; and how I brou ht them to justice, tried
them, and ordered them all three toie hanged. What there
was reall in this shall be seen in its place; for however I
came to arm such things in to dream, and what secret con-
verse of spirits injected it, yet t iere was, I say, much of it true.
I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and specifi-
cally true ; but the general part was so true--the base, Villain-
ous behavior of these three hardened rogues was such, and
had been so much worse than all I can describe, that the dream
had too much similitude of the fact; and as I would after-
wards have punished them severely, so, if I had hanged them
all, I had been much in the right, and even should have been
justified both b the laws of God and man. But to return to
my story. In t is kind of temper I lived some years; I had
no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable di-
version, but what had something or other of this in it ; so that
my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very
seriously one night that she believed there was some secret,
powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had deter-
mined me to go thither again; and that she found nothing
hindered my going, but my being engaged to a wife and chil-
dren. She told me that it was true she .could not think of
partin with me ; but as she was assured that if she was dead
it wo d be the first thing I would do 5 so, as it seemed to her
that the thing was determined above, she would not be the
only obstruction; for, if I thought fit and resolved to go--
1[Here she found me vei intent upon her words, and that I
ooked very earnestly at er, so that it a little disordered her,
and she sto ped. I asked her why she did not go on and say
out what 5 e was going to say. But I perceived that her
heart was too full, and some tears stood in her e es] " S eak
out, my dear," said I ; "are you willing I shoul o? " " 0,"
says she, very afiectionately, " I am far from w' in ; but if
you are resolved to 1510," says she, "rather than I wou d be the
only hindrance, I w 1 go with you; for though I think it a-
most preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your
condition, yet, if it must be," said she, again weeping, "I would
not leave you ; for, if it be of Heaven, you must do it ; there
is no resisting it ; and if Heaven make it your duty to go, He
will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of
me, that I may not obstruct it."

This afiectionate behavior of my wife's brought me a little
out of the vapors, and I began to consider what I was doing ; I
corrected my wanderin fancy, and began to argue with myself
sedatel what businessgI had, after threescore years, and after
such a ife of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so
happy and easy a manner--I say, what business had I to rush
into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only for
youth and poverty to run into ?

With 'those thoughts I considered my new engagement;
that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with
child of another; that I had all the world could give me, and
had no need to seek hazard for gain ; that I was declining in
years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained
than of seeking to increase it ; that as to what my wife
had said of its being an im ulse from Heaven, and that it
should be in duty to go, I ha no notion of that ; so,'after many
of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of my imagin-
ation, reasoned myself out of it ; as I believe people may
always do in like cases if they will ; and, in a word, I con-
quered it ; composed myself Wltl) such arguments as occurred
to my thoughts, and w ich my present condition furnished
me entifully with; and particularly, as the most effectual
met od, I resolved to divert myself with other things, and to
engage in some business that might efl'ectually tie me up from
any more excursions of this kind ; forI found that thing return
upon me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothin to do, nor
anything of moment immediately before me. To t iis purpose,
I' bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, and resolved
to remove myself thither. I had alittle convenient house up-
on it, and the land about it, I found, was capable of great im-
provement; and it was many ways suited to my inclination,
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and im-
proving of land ; and particularly, being an inland county, I
was removed from conversing among sa ore, and things relat-
ing to the remote parts of the world.

n a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family,
bought plows, harrows, a cart, wa on, horses, cows, and
sheep, and, setting seriously to work, ecame in one half-year
a mere country gentleman ; my thoughts were entirely taken
n in managing my servants, cultivating the ground, inclosing,

anting, etc. ; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable
ife that nature was capable of directing, or that a man always
bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent to pay, was
limited by no articles ; I could pull up or out down as I
pleased ; what I planted was for m self, and what I improved
was for my family ; and having t Ius left of the thought of
wandering, I had not the least discomfort in an part of life
as to this world. Now I thou ht indeed that enjoyed the
middle state of life, which my fat er so earnestly recommended
to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life something like what
is described by the poet, upon the subject of a country life :

Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare.

But in the middle of all this felicit , one blow from unseen
Providence unhinged me at once ; an not only made a breach
upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its conse-
quences, into a deep relapse of the wandering disposition which,
as I may say, being born in my vel blood soon recovered its
hold of me ; and, like the returns 0 a violent distemper, came
on with an irresistible force upon me. This blow was the loss
of my wife. It is not my business here to write an elegy
upon my wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and
make my court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral ser-
mon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my afiairs,
the center of all my enterprises, the en ine that, by her pru-
ence, reduced me to that happy compass was in, from the most
extravagant and ruinous roject that filled my head ; and did
more to guide my ramb mg genius than a mother's tears, a
father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reason-
ing powers could do. I was happy in listening to her, and in
being moved by her entreaties 3 and to the last degree deso-
late and dislocated in the world by the loss of her. When
she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. I was
as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the
Brazils, when I first went on shore there ; and as much alone,
except for the assistance of servants, as I was in my island.
I knew neither what to think nor what to do. I saw the
world busy around me ; one part laboring for bread,
another part squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures,
equally miserable, because the end they proposed still fled
from them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of
their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance;
and the men of labor spent their strength in daily struggling
for bread to maintain the vital strength they labored with ; so
living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end of
\vearisome life, and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily
bread. .

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the
island ; where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did
not want it; and bred no more goats, because I had no more
use for them ; where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
moldy, and had scarce the favor to be looked upon in twenty

ears.

y All these things, had' I improved them as,I ought to have
done, and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would
have tau ht me to search farther than human enjoyments
for a full felicity ; and that there was something which
certainly was the reason and end of life, superior to all these
things, and which was either to be possessed, or at least hoped
for, on this side the grave. .

But my sage counselor was gone ; I was like a ship with-
out a ilot, that could only run afore the wind. My thoughts
ran all away again into the old affair; my head was uite
turned with the whimseys of foreign adventures ; and al the
pleasant, innocent amusements of my farm, my garden, my
cattle,and my family, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music to one
that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste ; in a word,
I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return
to London ; and in a few months after I did 'so.

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was
before; I had no relish for the place, no employment in it,
nothing to do but saunter about like an idle person, of whom
it may be said he is perfectly useless in God's creation, and it
is not one farthing's matter to the rest of his kind whether he
be dead or alive. This also was the thing which, of all cir-
cumstances of life, was the most my averston, who had been
all in days used to an active life ; and I would often say to
myse f, "A state of idleness is the very dregs of life" ; and,
indeed,I thought I was much more suitably employed when I
was twenty-six days making a deal board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my
nephew, whom,as I have observed before, I had brought up to
the sea, and had made him commander of a shi ,was come
home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the rst he had
made. He came to me, and told me that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been pro osing to him to go a voyage
for them to the East Indies, an to China, as private traders.
" And now, uncle," says he, "if you will go to sea with me, I
will engage to land you upon your old habitation in the island ;
for we are to touch at the Brazils." '

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state,
and of the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence
of second causes with the ideas of things which we form in
our minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any
in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wander.
ing was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he
had in his thoughts to say, when that very morning,'.before he
came to me,I 'ad, in a great deal of confusion of thought,
and revolving every part of my circumstances in my mind,
come to this resolution, that I would go to Lisbon, and consult
with m old sea-captain ; and if it was rational and practicable,
I won] go and see the island again, and what was become of
my people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts of
peopling the place, and carrying in labitants from hence, get-
ting a patent for the possession, and I know not what ; when,
in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have said,
ivith his projectof carrying me thither in his way to the East

ndies. '

gvaaused awhile at his words, and looking steadily at him,
" at devil," said I, "sent (you on this unlucky errand?"
My nephew stared as if he ha been frightened, at first; but
perceiving that I was not much displeased with the proposal,

e recovered himself. " I hope it may not be an unlucky pro-
posal, sir, " says he ; "I dare say you would be pleased to see
your new colony there, where you once reigned with more
felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the world."

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with m temper, that
is to say, the prepossession I was under, and 0 which I have
said so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed
with the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I
would not promise to go any farther than my own island.
" Why, sir," says he, " on don't want to be left there again,
I hope ?" " Wh ," said I, "can you not take me up again on
your return ?" e told me it would not be possible to do so ;
that the merchants would never allow him to come that way
with a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of
his way, and might be three or four. "Besides, sir, if I should
miscarry," said he, " and not return at all, then you would be
just reduced to the condition you were in before." .

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy
for it; which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship,
which being taken in pieces, and shipped on board the ship,
might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to
carry with us, be set up again in the island, and finished fit to
go to sea in a few days.

I was not long resolvin ; for, indeed, the importunities of
my nephew joined so e ectually with my inclination that
nothing could oppose me. On the other hand, my wife being
dead, nobody concerned themselves so much for me as to per-
suade me to one way or the other, except my ancient good
friend the widow, who earnestly stru gled with me to consider
my years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of
a long voyage; and above all, my young children. But it
was all to no purpose: I had an irresistible desire for the
voyage ; and I told her I thought there was something so un-
common iu the impressions I had u on my mind, that it would
be a kind of resisting Providence i I should attempt to stay
at home ; after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined
with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but
also in settling my family afiairs for my absence, and provid-
in for the education of my children.

n order to do this, I made my will, and settled the estate I
had in such a manner for my children, and placed in such
hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have
justice done them, whatever might befall me ; and for their
education, I left it wholly to the widow, with a sufficient main-
tenance to herself for her care ; all which she richly deserved;
for no mother could have taken more care in their education,
or understood it better ; and as she lived till I came home, I
also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of J an-
uary, 1694-5 ; and I, With my man Friday, went on board, in
the Downs, on the 8th ; having, besides that sloop, which I
mentioned above, a very considerable car 0 of all kinds of
necessary things for my colony ; which, i I did not find in
good condition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed to
place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there
upon my account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there,
or carry them forward,as they should appear willing ; particu-
larly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, in-
genious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a.
general mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels,
and hand-mills to grind corn; wasa good turner and a good pot-
maker ; he also made anything that was proper to make of earth
or of wood ; in a word, we called him our J ack-of--all-trades.
With these I carried a tailor, who had ofiered himself to go a
passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards
consented to stay on our new plantation ; and who proved a
most necessary, handy fellow, as could be desired, in many others
businesses besides that of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly,
necessity arms us for all employments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept ac-
count of the particulars, consisted of a suflicient quantity of
linen, and some En lish thin stuffs for clothing the Spaniards
that I expected to ad there ; and enou h of them as, by my
calculation, might comfortably su ply t em for seven years.
If I remember right, the materials carried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing amounted to above two hundred
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and household stuff,
particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass,
etc., and near a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails, tools
of every kind, staples, hooks,hinges, and every necessary thing
I could think of.

I carried also a hundred s are arms, muskets, and fusees;
besides some istols, a consi erable quantity of shot of all
sizes, three or our tons of lead, and two pieces of brass can-
non ; and, because I knew not what time and what extremities
I_ was providing for,I carried a hundred barrels of owder,
besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron art of some p1 es and
halberts; so that, in short, we had a arge magazine of all
sorts of stores, and I made my ne hew carr two small "arter-
deck guns more than he wante for his 3 ip, to leave ehind
if there was occasion; that when we came there, we might
build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies ; and, in-
deed, I at first thought there would be need enough for all,
and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the
island ; as shall be seen in the course of the story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used
to meet with; and therefore shall have the less occasion to
interrupt the reader, who, perhaps, may be impatient to hear
how matters went with my colony. et some odd accidents,
cross winds, and bad weather happened on this first setting
out, which made the voya e longer thanIexpected it at first;
and I, who had never made but one voyage--my first voyage
to Guinea--in which I might be said to come back again, as the
voyage was at first desi ned, began to think the same ill fate
attended me ; and that was born to he never contented with
being on shore, and yet to be alwa s unfortunate at sea.

Contrary winds first at us to t e northward, and we were
obliged to put in at Ga way, in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two-and-twenty days ; but we had this satisfaction
with the disaster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap,
and in the utmost plenty; so that while we lay here, we never
touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them. Here, also,
I took in several live ho s, and two cows with their calves,
which I resolved, if I ha a good passage, to put on shore in
nlily island; but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of
t em.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a
very fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might
be about the 20th of February, in the evenin late, when the
mate having the watch came into the round- ouse, and told
us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and while he
was telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain
heard-another. This made us all run out upon the quarter-
deck, where, for awhile, we heard nothing; but in a few
minutes we saw a very great light, and found that there was
some very terrible fire at a distance. Immediately we had
recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed that there
could be no land that way in Which the fire showed itself, no,
not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at W.N.W.
Upon this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea ;
and as, by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we con-
cluded that it could not be far ofi, we stood directly towards
it, and were presently satisfied we should discover it, because
the farther we sailed, the greater the light appeared ; though,
the weather being hazy, we could not perceive anything but
the light for a while. In about half an hour's sailing, the
wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a great
shi on fire, in the middle of the sea.

was most sensibl touched with this disaster, though not
at all acquainted with the persons enga ed in it: I presently
recollected my former circumstances, an what condition I was
in when taken up by the Portuguese captain ; and how much
more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belong-
ing to that shi must be, if they had no other ship in company
with them. pon this, I immediately ordered that five guns
should be fired, one soon after another, that, if ossible, we
might give notice to them that there was help or them at
hand, and that they might endeavor to save themselves in their
boat ; for though we could see the flames of the ship, yet they,
it bein night, could see nothin of us.

lVe lay by some time upon this, onl driving as the burning
ship drove, waiting for daylight ; w en, on a sudden, to our
great terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew u
in the air ; and immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, a
the fire was out ; that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This
was _a terrible, and, indeed, an afflicting sight, for the sake of
the poor men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed
in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in their boat, in the
middle of the ocean ; which, at present, as it was dark, I could
not see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I caused
lights to be hung out in all parts of the shi where we could,
and which we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the
night long ; letting them know by this that there was a ship
not far ofi.

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's
boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there
were two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the
water. We erccived they rowed, the wind being against
them ; that t iey saw our ship, and did their utmost to make
us see them.

\Ve immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we
saw them, and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come
on board ; and then made more sail, standing directly to them.
In little more than half an hour we came up with them ; and,
in a word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men,
women, and children ; for there were a great many passengers.

Upon inquiry, we found it was a French merchant ship of
three hundred tones, homeward-bound from Quebec, in the
river of Canada. The master gave us a long account of the
distress of his ship ; how the fire began in the steerage, b the
negligence of the steersman ; but, on his crying out for elp,
was, as everybody thought, entirely put out; but they soon
found that some sparks of the first fire had got into some part
of the ship so difficult to come at that they could not efiectually
quench it ; and afterwards getting in between the timbers, and
within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and
mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to
exert.

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats,
which, to their great comfort, were pretty lar e ; being their
long boat, and a great shallop, besides a small s ifi, which was
of no great service to them, other than to get some fresh water
and provisions into her, after the had secured their lives from
the fire. They had, indeed, sma 1 hope for their lives by get-
ting into these boats, at that distance from any land ; only, as
they said, that they thus escaped from the fire, and there was
a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea, and
might take them in. The had sails, oars, and a compass; and
were preparing to make t ie best of their way back to New-
foundland, the wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy
gale at SE. by E. They had as much provision and water as,
with sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might sup-
port them about twelve days, in which, if they had no bad
weather and no contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he
might get to the Banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps
take some fish to sustain them till they might go on shore.
But there were so many chances a ainst them in all these
cases, such as storms to overset and ounder them ; rains and
cold to benumb and perish their limbs; contrary winds to
keep them out and starve them, that it must have been next to
miraculous if they had escaped.

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless
and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told
me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a
gun fire, and after that four more; these were the five guns
which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This re-
vived, their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above,
I desired it should, that there was a ship at hand for their help.
It was upon the hearing of these guns that they took down
their masts and sails ; the sound coming from the windward,
they resolved to lie by till morning. Some time after this,
hearin no more guns, they fired three muskets, one a consider-
able w ile after another ; but these, the wind being contrary,
we never heard. -

Some time after that a ain, they were still more agreeably
surprised with seeing our ights, and hearing the guns which,
as I have said, I caused to be fired all the rest of the night.
This set them to work with their oars, to keep their boats
ahead, at least, that we might the sooner come up with them;
and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor de-
livered people ran into to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described ;
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and
hands make up the sum of its variety ; but an excess of joy,
a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it. There
were some in tears ; some raging and tearing themselves as if
they had been in the reatest agonies of sorrow; some stark
ravrng and downright unatic ; some ran about the ship stamp-
ing with their feet, others wringing their hands ; some were
dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying, many quite
dumb, not able to speak a word ; others sick and vomiting;
several swooning and ready to faint; and a few were crossing
themselves and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them either; there might be many that
were thankful afterwards ; but the assion was too strong for
them at first, and they were not ab e to master it; they were
thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a
verPy few that were composed and serious in their joy.

erhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from
the particular circumstance of the nation they belonged to,
I mean the French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile,
more assionate, and more slirightly, and their spirits more
fluid t an of other nations. am not philosopher enough to
determine the cause ; but nothing I had ever seen before came
up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, my trust savage, was in,
when he found his father in the boat, came t e nearest to it;
and the surprise of the master and his two companions, whom
I delivered from the villains that set them on shore in the island,
came a little way towards it ; but nothing was to compare to
this, either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my life.

It is further observable that these extravagances did not
show themselves in that difierent manncthave mentioned, in
different persons only ; but all the variety would appear, in a
short succession of moments, in one and the same person. A
man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and
confounded, would the next minute be dancing and hallooing
like an antic; and the next moment he tearing his hair, or
pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet
like a madman ; in a few moments after we would have him'l'm-z l'Asssxm-zus 0F 'ms BURNING Sum--Page 248.
all in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not immediate
help been had, he would in a few minutes have been dead ; and
thus it was not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with
the greatest part of them ; and, if I remember right, our sur-
geon.was obliged to let blood of about thirty of them.

There were two priests among them : one an old man, and
the other a youn man ; and that which was strangest was, the
oldest man was t e worst. As soon as he set his foot on board
our ship, and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead
to all appearance ; not the least sign of life could be perceived
in him : our sur eon immediately applied proper remedies to
recover him, an was the only man in the ship that believed he
was not dead. At length he opened a vein in his arm, having
first chafed and rubbed the part so as to warm it as much as

ossible. Upon this, the blood, which only dropped at first,

owing freely, in three minutes after the man opened his eyes ;
and a quarter of an hour after that he s oke, grew better, and
in alittle time quite well. After the b ood was stop ed, he
walked about, told us he was perfectly well, took a ram of
cordial which the surgeon gave him, and had come to himself.
About a quarter of an hour after this, they came running into
the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman
that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad.
It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his circum-
stances in his mind, and again this put him into an ecstasy of
joy. His spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could
convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish ; and the man
was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it. The
surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave
him something to doze and put him to sleep ; which after
some time operated upon him, and he awoke next morning
perfectly composed and well.

The younger priest behaved with great command of his
passions, and was really an example of a serious, well-governed
mind. At his first coming on board the ship, he threw him-
self flat on his face, rostrating himself in thankfulness for
his deliverance : in w ich I unhap ily and unseasonably dis-
turbed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon ; but he
spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks
for his deliverance ; begged me to leave him a few moments,
and that next to his Maker he would ive me thanks also.

I was heartil sorry that I disturbe him, and not only left
him but kept at ers from interrupting him also. He continued
in that posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left
him 3 then came to me, as he had said he would, and, with a
great deal of seriousness and afiection, but with tears in his
eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him and so many
miserable creatures their lives. I told him I had no need to
tell him to thank God for it, rather than me, for I had seen
that he had done that already ; but I added that it was noth-
ing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men, and
that we had as much reason as he to ive thanks to God, who
had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of his mercy
to so many of his creatures.

After this the young priest applied himself to his country-
men ; labored to compose them ; persuaded, entreated, argued,
reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within
the exercise of their reason; and with some he had success,
though others were for a time out of all government of them-
selves.

I Cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it
may be useful to these into whose hands it may fall, for guid-
ing themselves in the extravagances of their passions ; for if an
excess of by can carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of t eir reason, what will not the extrava ances of anger,
rage, and a provoked mind carry us to ? An , indeed, here 1
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of
every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of
sorrow and anger.

We were somewhat disordered by these extravagance!
among our new guests, for the first day ; but after they had re-
tired to lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would
allow, and they had slept heartily,--as most of them did, being
fatigued and frightened,--they were quite another sort of
peo Ie the next day.

othing of good manners, or civil acknowled cuts for the
kindness shown them, was wanting ; the Frenc , it is known,
are naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain
and one of the priests came to me the next day, and desired to
speak with me and my ne hew. The commander began to
consult with us what shou d be done with them; and, first,
the told us we had saved their lives, so all they had was
litt e enough for a return to us for that kindness received.
The captain said they had saved some money and some things
of value in their boats, caught hastily out of the flames, and
if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an oEer of
it all to us; they only desired to be set on shore somewhere
in our way, where, if possible, they might get- a passage to
France. My nephew wished to accept their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them afterwards ; but
I overruled him in that part, for I knew what it was to be set
on shore in a strange country ; and if the Portu uese ca tain
that took me up at sea had served me so, and ta en all had
for my deliverance, Imust have starved, or have been as much
a slave at the Brazzls as I had been at Barbary, the mere be-
in g sold to a Mohammedan excepted; and perhaps aPortuguese
is not a much better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases,
much worse.

I therefore told the French ca tain that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true, at that it was our duty to do
so, as we were fellow-creatures ; and we would desire to be so
delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity ; that
we had done nothing for them but what we believed they
would have done for us if we had been in their case and
they in ours; but that we took them up to save them, not to
plunder them ; and it would be a most barbarous thing to take
that little from them which they had saved out of the fire, and
then set them on shore and leave them ; that this would be first
to save them from death, and then kill them ourselves ; save
them from drowning, and abandon them to starving; and,
therefore, I would not let the least thing be taken from them.
As to setting them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was an
exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East Indies ; and though we were driven out of our course to
the westward a very great way, and perhaps were directed by
Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible
for us willfully to change our voyage on their particular ac-
count ; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the
freighter-s with whom he was under charter to pursue his
voyage by way of Brazil; and all I knew we could do for
them was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other
ships homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them a
passage, if possible, to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in
very great consternation, especially the assengers, at the no-
tion of being carried away to the East ndies ; they then en--
treated me, that as I was driven so far to the westward before
I met with them, I would, at least, keep on the same course to
the Banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might
meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry
them back to Canada, from whence they came.

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part,
and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for, indeed, I consid-
ered that to carry this whole company to the East Indies
would not only be an intolerable severity upon the poor people,
but would be ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our
provisions; so I thought it no breach of charter-party, but
what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessar to us,
and in which no one could say we were to blame ; for t e laws
of God and nature would have forbid that we should refuse to
take up two boats full of people in such a distressed condi-
tion ; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting our-
selves as the poor eo 1e, obliged us to set them on shore
somewhere or other or t eir deliverance. So I consented that
we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather
would permit ; and if not, that I would carry them to Martin-
ico, in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty

ood ; "and as the winds had continued in the points between

.E. and SE. a long time, we missed several opportunities of
sending them to France ; for we met several ships bound to
Euro e, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's ;
but t ey had been so long beating up against the wind that
they durst not take in passen ers, for fear of wanting ro-
visions for the voyage, as wel for themselves as for t ose
they should take in; so we were obli ed to go on. It was
about a week after this that we made tie Banks of Newfound-
land ; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French peo-
ple on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put
them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if they
could get provisions to vietual themselves with. When I say
all the French went on shore, I should remember that the
voung priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East
Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore
on the coast of Coromandel ; which I readily agreed to, for I
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as will
appear afterwards; also, four of the seamen entered them-
selves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the WestIndies, steer-
ing away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together,
sometimes little or no wind at all ; when we met with another
sub'ect for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable
as t. at before.

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the
19th day of March, 1694-5, when we spied a sail, our course
SE. and by S. We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and
that she bore up to us, but could not at first know what to
make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she
had lost her main-topmast, foremast, and bowsprit ; and pres-

.--
ently she fired a gun as a si al of distress. The weather was
pretty good, wind at N.N. . a fresh gale, and we soon came
to s eak with her.

e found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes,
but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few da s
before she was ready to sail by a terrible hurricane, while t e
captain and chief mate were both gone on shore ; so that, be-
sides the terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent case
for good artists to bring the ship home. They had been al-
ready nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible
storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them
qlpite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in which
t ey had lost their masts. They told us they expected to
have seen the Bahama Islands, ut were then driven away
again to the southeast, by a strong gale of wind at N.N.W.,
the same that blew now : and having no sails to work the ship
with but a main course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury-
foremast, which they had set up, they could not lie near the
wind, but were endeavoring to stand away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had
undergone ; their bread and flesh were quite gone ; they had
not one ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days.
The only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and
they had about half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar
enough ; some suceades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, but
they were all devoured ; and they had seven casks of rum.

There was a youth, and his mother, and a maid-servant on
board, who were passengers, and thinkin the ship was ready
to sail, unhappil came on board the evening before the hurri-
cane began; an havin no provisions of their own left, they
were in a more deplora le condition than the rest, for the sea-
men, being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves,
had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers ;
and they were, indeed, in such a condition that their misery is
very hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not
led me (the weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go
on board the ship. The second mate, who upon this occasion
commanded the ship, had been on board our ship, and he told
me they had three passengers, in the great cabin, that were in
a deplorable condition. "Nay," says he, "I believe they are
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days;
and I was afraid to inquire after them," said be, "for I had
nothing to relieve them with."
We immediately a plied ourselves to give them what relief
we could spare ; an , indeed, I had so far overruled things
with my nephew, that I would have victualled them, though
we had gone away to Virginia, or any other part of the coast
of America, to have supplied ourselves ; but there was no neces-
sity for that.

But now the were in new danger ; for they were afraid of
eating too muc , even of that little we gave them. The mate,
or commander, brou ht six men with him in his boat ; but these
poor wretches looke like skeletons, and were so weak that the
could hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was ver il ,
and half-starved ; for he declared he had reserved not ing
from the men, and went share and share alike with them in
every bit they ate.

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him
immediately ; and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he
began to be sick and out of order ; so he stopped awhile, and
our surgeon mixed him something with some roth, which he
said would be to him both food and physio ; and after he had
taken it he grew better. In the meantime, I for ot not the
men ; I ordered victuals to be iven them, an the poor
creatures rather devoured than ate it ; they were so exceedingly
hungry that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no com-
mand of themselves ; and two of them ate with so much greedi-
ness that they were in danger of their lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me,
and brought me to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my
first coming on shore in my island, where I had never the least
mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any ; besides
the hourly agprehensions I ad of being made the food of other
creatures. ut all the while the mate was thus relating to me
the miserable condition of the ship's compan , I could not put
out of my thought the story he had told me of t 1e three poor crea-
tures in the great cabin, viz., the mother, her son, and the maid-
servant, whom he had heard nothin of for two or three days,
and whom, he seemed to confess, they ad wholly neglected, their
own extremities being so great; by which I understood that
they had really given them no food at all, and that therefore
they must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the
floor or deck of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain,
on board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not
the starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own
boat to go on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve
men, to carry them a sack of bread and four or five pieces of
beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat
to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-
room to prevent the men takin it to eat raw, or taking it out
of the pot before it was well boi ed, and then to give every man
but a very little at a time : and by this caution he preserved
the men, who would otherwise have killed themselves with that
ver food that was given them on purpose to save their lives.

It the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin and see what condition the poor passengers were in ; and
if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what re-
freshments was proper: and the surgeon gave him a large
pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which he had given
the mate that was on board, and which he did not question
would restore them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above, having
a great mind to see the scene of misery which I knew the shi
itself would resent me with, in a more livel manner than
could have it y report, I took the captain o the ship, as we
now called him, with me, and went myself, a little after, in
their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get
the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready ; but the mate
observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room
door; and the man he placed there, after using all possible

ersuasion to have patience, kept them of b force : however,
lie caused some biscuit cakes to be dip e in the at, and
softened with the liquor of the meat, whic they calle brewis,
and gave them every one some to stay their stomachs, and
told them it was for their own safety that he was obliged to
give them but a little at a time. But it was all in vain; and
had I not come on board, and their own commander and offi-
cers with me, and with good words, and some threats also of
giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into
the cook-room by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace,
for words are indeed of very small force to a hungry belly;
however, we pacified them, and fed them gradually and
cautiously for the first, and the next time ave them more,
and at last filled their bellies, and the men di well enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest ; for as, first, the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too true that
they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally neglected
them ; so that for six or seven days it might be said they had
really no food at all, and for several days before very little.
The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman of
sense and good breeding, had 5 ared all she could so affection-
ately for her son, that at last s e entirely sank under it ; and
when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or
deck, with her back up against the sides between two chairs,
which were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoulders,
like a. corpse, though not uite dead. My mate said all he could
to revive and encourage er, and with a spoon put some broth
into her mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted u one hand,
but could not speak : yet she understood what e said, and
made signs to him, intimating that it was too late for her, but
pointed to her child, as if she would have said the should take
care of him. However, the mate, who was excee ingly moved
at the sight, endeavored to get some of the broth into her
mouth, and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down;
though I question whether he could be sure of it or not 3 but it
was too late, and she died the same night.

The youth, who was preserved _ at the price of his most
afiectionate mother's life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay in
a cabin bed, as one stretched out with hardly any life left in
him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having
eaten up the rest of it; however, being young, and having
more strength than his mother, the mate got something down
his throat, and he began sensibly to revive; though by giv-
ing him, some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extra-
ordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up again.

But the next care was the poor maid; she lay all alon
upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that ha
fallen down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her
limbs were distorted ; one of her bands was clas ed round the
frame of the chair and she gripped it so hard t at we could
not easil make her let it go; her other arm lay over her
head, an her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame
of the cabin table: in short, she lay just like one in the
agonies of death, and yet she was alive too.

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
terrified with the thoughts of death,but,as the men told us
afterwards, was brokenhearted for her mistress, whom she saw
dying for two or three days before, and whom she loved most
tenderly.

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our
surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and expe-
rience, had, with reat application, recovered her as to life, he
had her upon hisiands still ; for she was little less than dis-
tracted for a considerable time after.

Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to
consider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the
country, where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight
at a place ; our business was to relieve this distressed ship's
crew, but not lie by for them ; and though they were willin
to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we could
carry no sail, to keep ace with a ship that had no masts:
however, as their captain begged of us to help him to set up a
main-topmast, and a kind of topmast to his jury-foremast, we
did, as it were, lie by him for three or four days; and then,
having given him five barrels of beef,a barrel of pork, two
hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of eas, flour, and what
other things we could spare, and taking t ree casks of sugar,
some rum, and some pieces-of-eight from them for satisfaction,
we left them, taking on board with us, at. their own earnest re-
quest, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age ; a retty,
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with
the loss of his mother, and, as it seems, he had lost his father
but a few months before, at Barbadoes; he begged of the
sur eon to s eak to me to take him out of the ship ; for he
said the crue fellows had murdered his mother; and, indeed,
so they had, that is to say, passively; for they might have
spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that
might have preserved her life,though it had been but just
enough to keep her alive ; but hunger knows no friend, no re-
lation, no justice, no right, and therefore is remorseless, and
ca able of no compassion.

I'he surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it
would carry him away from all his frien s, and put him,

erhaps, in as bad circumstances almost as those we found him
in--that is to say, starving in the world. He said it mattered
not whither he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible
crew that he was amon ; that the captain (by which he
meant me, for he could inow nothing of my nephew) had
saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him ; and as for
the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be
very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The
surgeon re resented the case so afiectionately to me that I
yielded,an~ we took them both on board,with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed
or come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them,
I made his commander sign a writin , obliging himself to go,
as soon as he came to Bristol, to fiir. Rogers, a merchant
there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to delivera
letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belong-
ing to the deceased widow ; which I suppose was not done, for
Icould never learn that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is
most. probable, lost at sea; being in so disabled a condition, and
so far from any land, that I am of opinion the first storm she
met with afterwards she might founder in the sea, for she
was leaky, and had damage in her hold when we met with
her.

I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, and had
hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, thou h, at first, the
winds had been contrary. I shall trouble no ody with the
little incidents of wind, weather, currents, etc., on the rest of
our voyage ; but, to shorten my story, shall observe that I
came to my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April,
1695. It was with no small difiiculty that I found the place ;
for as I came to it, and went from it, before, on the south and
east side of the island, coming from the Brazils, so now,
comin in between the main and the island, and having no
chart or the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know it when
I saw it, or know whether I saw it or not.

We heat about a great while, and went on shore on several
islands in the mouth of the great river Oronooque, but none
for m purpose ; only this I learned by my coasting the shore,
that Iywas under one great mistake before, viz., that the con-
tinent which I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was
really no continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of
islands, reaching from one to the other side of the extended
mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came to
my island were not properly those which we call Caribees, but
islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who inhab-
ited nearer to our side than the rest.

In short,I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not; on one of
them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had lived
there ; but, speaking With them, found they had a sloop lying
in a small creek hard by, and came thither to make salt, and
to catch some earl-mussels if they could; but that they be-
longed to the sle de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in the
latitude of 10 and 11 degrees.

Thus, coasting from one island to another, sometimes with
the.ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop, which we
had found a convenient boat, and therefore kept her with
their very good will, at length I came fair on the south side of
my island, and presently knew the very countenance of the
place ; so I brought the shi safe to an anchor, broadside with
the little'creek where my 0 d habitation was.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked
him if he knew where he was? He looked about a little, and
presently clapping his hands, cried, " Oh, yes ; oh, thpre--oh,
yes; oh, there ! " pointing to our old habitation,and fell danc-
ing and ca ering like a mad fellow ; and I had much ado to
keep him rom jumping into the sea to swim ashore to the

lace.

P " Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find anybody
here or no? and do you think we shall see your father?"
The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while : but, when I
named his father, the oor affectionate creature looked de-
jected and I could see t e tears run down his face very plen-
tifully. "What is the matter, Friday? " said I ; "are you
troubled because you may see your father ?" " No, no," says
he, shakin his head, " no see him more ; no, never more see
him again. ' "Why so," said I, "Friday? How do you know
that?" "Oh, no; oh, no," says Friday; "he long ago die,
long ago; he much old man." " Well, well," says-I, " Fri-
day,you don't know; but shall we see an one else, then ?"
The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than , and he points to
the hill just above my old house ; and, though we lay half a
league off,he cries out, "Me see, me see; yes, yes, me see much
man there, and there, and there!" I looked, but I saw no-
body--no, not with a perspective-glass, which was, I suppose,
because I could not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as
I found upon inquiry the next day; and there were five or six
men all to ether, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing
what to think of us.

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the Eng-
lish ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them
notice we were friends; and in about a quarter of an hour
after we perceived a smoke arise from the side of the creek ;
so I immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me ;
and, hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce, I went di-
rectly on shore, taking with me the young friar I mentioned,
to whom I had told the etc of my living there, and the man-
ner of it, and every particu ar, both of myself and those I left
there, and who was, on that account, extremely desirous to go
with me. We had, besides, about sixteen men well armed, if
we had found any new guests there which we did not know of ;
but we had no need of weapons.

As we went on shore u on the tide of flood, near high water,
we rowed directly into tie creek ; and the first man I fixed
m eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and
w om I knew by his face perfectly well ; as to his habit, I
shall describe it' afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at
first but myself ; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat
for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a
good way ad the Spaniards,where, indeed, I saw nothing of him ;
and if they had not let him go ashore, he would have jumped
into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to
his father, like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made
any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolution, to have
seen the first transports of this poor fellow's 'oy when he came
to his father; how be embraced him, kisse him, stroked his
face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him ; then stood and looked at him, as any one
would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour to-
gether; then lay down on the ground, and stroked his legs,
and kissed them, and then got up again, and stared at him ;
one would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would
have made a dog laugh the next day to see how his passion
ran out another way: in the morning he walked along the
shore, and again with his father, several hours, always leading
him by the hand, as if he had been a lad ; and every now
and then he would come to the boat to etch something or
other for him, either a lump 'of sugar, a dram, a biscuit cake,
or something or other that was good. In the afternoon his
frolics ran another way ; for then he would set the old man
down upon the ground, and dance about him, and make a
thousan antic postures and gestures; and all the while he did
this he would be talking to him, and tellin him one story or
another of his travels, and of what happene to him abroad, to
divert him. In short, if the same filial afiection was to be
found in Christians to their parents, in our art of the world,
one would be tempted to say there would ardly have been
anfi need of the fifth commandment.

at this is a digression : I return to my landing. It would
be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities
that the Spaniards received me with. The first S aniard,
whom, as I said, I knew ver well, was he whose li e I had
saved. He came towards e boat, attended by one more,
carrying a flag of truce also; and he not only did notknow me at
first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that
was come, till I spoke to him. "Seignior," said I, in Portu-
guese, " do you not know me?" At which he spoke not a
word, but, giving his musket to the man that was with him,
threw his arms abroad, and, saying something in Spanish that
I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, tell-
ing me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that
he had once seen as if an angel from Heaven, sent to save his
life ; he said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-
bred Spaniard always knows how ; and then, beckoning to the
person that attended him, bade him go and call out his com-
rades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation,
where he would give me possession of my own house again,
and where I should see they had made but mean improve-
ments ; so I walked along with him ; but alas ! I could no
more find the place again than if I had never been there ; for
they had planted so many trees, and placed them in such a posi-
tion, so thick and close to one another, and in ten years' time
they were grown so bi , that, in short, the place was inacessi-
ble, except y such win ings and blind ways as they themselves
onl , who made them, could find.

Iy asked them what put them upon all these fortifications ;
he told me I would say there was need enough of it, when
they had given me an account how they had passed their time
since their arriving in the island, especially after they had
the misfortune to find that I was gone. He told me he could
not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he
heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction ;
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time
or other he should see me again ; but nothing that ever befell
him in his life, he said, was so surprising and afliicting to him,
at first, as the disappointment he was under when he came
back to the island and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me,
the Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the
sava es, onl that their number was so small : "and," says he,
" ha they een strong enough, we had been all long ago in
purgatory"; and with that he crossed himself on the breast.
"But, sir," says he, " I be e you will not be displeased when I
shall tell you how, force by necessity, we were obliged, for
our own reservation, to disarm them, and make them our sub-
jects, as t ey would not be content with being moderately our
masters, but would be our murderers." I answered, I was
afraid of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me
at my arting from the island but that they were not come
back, t rat I might have put them in possesston of everything
first, and left t e others in a state of subjection, as they de-
served ; but if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad,
and should be very far from finding any fault with it : for I
knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungovernable villains,
and were fit for any manner of mischief.
While I was saying this, the man came whom he had sent
back, and with him eleven more. In the dress they were in,
it was impossible to guess what nation the were of ; but he
made all clear both to them and to me. irst he turned to
me, and pointing to them, said, "These, sir, are some of the
gentlemen who owe their lives to you" ; and then turning to
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was ; upon
which the all came up, one by one, not as if they had been
sailors, and. ordinary fe lows, and the like, but really as if they
had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great
conqueror : their behavior was, to the last degree, obliging
and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity,
which very well became them; and, in short, they had so
much more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive
their civilities, much less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island,
after my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many
incidents, which the former part of my relation will help to
understand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer to
the account I have already given, that I cannot but commit
them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come
after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first
person, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand
" said 1's," and " said he's," and "he told me's," and "I told
him's," and the like ; but I shall collect the facts historically,
as near as I can gather them out of my memory, from what
they related to me, and from what I met with in my convers-
in with them, and with the place.

n order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I
must go back to the circumstances in which I left the island,
and in which the persons were of whom I am to speak. And
first, it is necessary to repeat that I had sent away Friday's
father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives I had rescued
from the sava es) in a large canoe to the main, as I then
thought it, to etch over the Spaniard's companions that he
left behind him, in order to save them from the like calam-
ity that he had been in, and in order to succour them for the
present; and that, if possible, we might together find some
way for our deliverance afterwards.

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or
the least room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more
than I had twenty years before--much less had I any
foreknowledge of what afterwards happened,I mean, of an
English ship coming on shore there to fetch me off ; and it
could not be but a very great surprise to them, when they
came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find three
strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left he-
hind me, which would otherwise have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I
might begin where I left ofl, was of their own part ; and Ide-
sired the S aniard would give me a articular account of his
voyage bac to his countrymen with t 1e boat, when I sent him
to fetch them over. He told me there was little variety in
that part, for nothing remarkable happened to them on the
way, aving had very calm weather and a smooth sea. As
for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he said,but that
they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the principal
man among them, the captain of the vessel they had been shi -
wrecked in havin been dead some time) ; they were, he said),
the more surprise to see him, because they knew that he was
fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they were satisfied,
would devour him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners;
that when he told them the story of his deliverance, and in
what manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it was
like a dream to them, and their astonishment, he said, was
somewhat like that of Jose h's brethren when he told them who
he was, and the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but
when he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and pro-
visions that he brought them for their journey or voyage,
they were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy
of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away
with him.

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they
were obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but
to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two
lar e canoes, or periaguas, on pretense of going out a fishing
or or pleasure. In these they came away the next morning.
It seems the wanted no time to get themselves ready; for
they had no aggage, neither clothes, nor provisions, nor any-
thing in the world but what they had on them, and a few
roots to eat, of which they used to make their bread.

They were in all three weeks absent ; and in that time, un-
luckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as
I mentioned in the other part, and to get off from the island,
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungovernable,
disagreeable villains behind me that any man could desire to meet
with; to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment
you may be sure.

The only just thing the rogues did was that when the Spaniards
came ashore they gave my letter to them, and gave them prm
visions, and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also
they gave them the lon paper of directions which I had left
with them, containing t e particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there; the way I baked my
bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn ; how I cured
my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, everything I did ; all
this being written down, they gave to the S aniards (two of
whom understood English well enough); nor id they refuse to
accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, for they agreed
very well for some time. They gave them an equal admission
into the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably ;
and the head S aniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods,
and Friday's ather to ether, managed all their affairs ; but as
for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the
island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises ; and when they came
home at night the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the
others but left them alone, which, however, they could not find
in their hearts to do long; but, like the dog in the manger,
they would not eat themselves, neither would the let the
others eat. The differences, nevertheless, were atfirst ut trivial
and such as are not worth relating, but at last it broke out into
open war: and it be an with all the rudeness and insolence
that can be imagine ----without reason, without provocation,
contrary to nature, and, indeed, to common sense ; and though,
it is true, the first relation of it came from the Spaniards them-
selves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to ex-
amine the fellows they could not deny a word of it.

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply
a defect in my former relation ; and this was, I forgot to set
down, among the rest, that just as we were weighing the an-
chor, to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board of our
ship, which I was once afraid would have turned to a second
mutiny; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his
courage, and taking us all to his assistance, fparted them by
force, and, making two of the most refractory ellows risoners,'
he laid them in irons ; and as they had been active in t e former!
disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous words the second
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England, and have
them hanged there for mutiny, and running away with the ship.
This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, fright-
ened some other men in the ship; and some of them had put
it into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them
good words for the present, till they 5 ould come to some
English port,'and that then they should be'ali put into {aih and
tried for their lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and
ac uainted us with it; upon which it was desired that I, who
stitil passed for a great man among them, should go down with
the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them they mi ht be
assured, if they behaved well the rest of the v0 a e, a 1 they
had done for the time past should be ardoned. 0 went, and
after passing my honor's word to t em, they appeared'easy,
and the more so when I caused the two men that were in irons
to be released and for iven.

But this mutiny ha brought us to an anchor for that night ;
the wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our
two men who had been laid in irons had stolen-each of them a
musket, and some other weapons (what powder or shot the
had we knew not), and had taken the ship's pinnace, which
was not yet hauled up, and run away with her to their com-
panions m roguery on shore. As soon as we found this, I
ordered the long-boat on shore with twelve men and the mate,
and away they went to seek the rogues ; but the could neither
find them nor any of the rest, for they all fled into the woods
when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate was once
resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their

lantations, burned all their household stuff and furniture, and
eft them to shift without it ; but havin no orders, he let it all
alone, left everything as he found it, an , bringing the pinnace
away, came on board without them. These two men made
their number five ; but the other three villains were so much
more wicked than they, that after they had been two or three
days together they turned the two newcomers out of doors to
shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them ;
nor could they, for a ood while, be persuaded to give them
an food ; as for the paniards, they were not yet come.
hen the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began
to go forward : the Spaniards would have persuaded the three
En lish brutes to have taken in their countrymen again, that,
as t ey said,~they might be all one family ; but they would not
hear of it ; so the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and
finding nothin but industry and application would make them
live comfortab y, they pitched their tents on the north shore of
the island, but a little more to the west, to be out of danger of
the sava es, who always landed on the cast parts of the island.

Here t iey built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the
other to lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the S an-
iards having given them some corn for seed, and some ofP the
peas which I had left them, they dug, planted, and inolosed,
after the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live rett
well. Their first crop of corn was on the ground ; and t ong
it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at first,
having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them,
and find them with bread and other eatables ; and one of the
fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the
rice and the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished
him to do.

They were going on in this little thriving position when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere
humor, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs ; that the ovenor, meaning me,
had given them the possession of it ; an nobody else had any
right to it; and that they should build no houses upon the
ground unless they would pay rent for them.

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked them
to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that
they had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded ; and
one of them merrily said, if they were the ground-landlords,
he hoped if they built tenements upon the land and made im-
provements, they would, according to the custom of landlords,
grant a long lease ; and desired they would get a scrivener to
draw the writings. One of the three, cursing and raging,
told them they should see they were not in jest ; and going to
a little place at a distance, where the honest men had made a fire
to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand, and claps it to the
outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire ; and it
would have been all burned down in a few minutes, if one of
the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod
the fire out with his feet, and that not without some difiiculty
too. '

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting
him away, that he returned upon him with a pole he had in
his hand, and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly,
and run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. His com-
rade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him,
and immediately they came both out with their muskets, and
the man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the
fellow down, that began the quarrel, with the stock of his mus-
ket, and that before the other two could come to help him;
and then, seeing the rest come at them they stood together,
and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them bade them
stand of.

The others had firearms with them too ; but one of the two
honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his
danger, told them if they offered to move hand or foot they
were dead men, and boldly commanded themto lay down their
arms. They did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but seein
him so resolute it brought them to a parley, and they consented
to take their wounded man with them and be gone ; and, in-
deed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the
blow. However, they were much in the wrong, since they
had the advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually,
as they might have done, and have gone immediately to the
Spaniards, and given them an account how the rogues had
treated them ; for the three villains studied nothin' but revenge,
and every day gave them some intimation that t ey did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part
of their rogueries, such as treading down their corn ; shooting
three young kids and a she-goat, which the poor men had got
to breed up tame for their store, and, in a word, plaguing
them night and day in this manner ; it forced the two men to
such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three,
the first time they had a fair opportunity. n order to do this,
they resolved to go to the castle, as they called it (that was
my old dwelling), where the three rogues and the Spaniards all
lived together at that time, intending to have a fair battle, and
the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play ; so they got u
in the morning before day, and came to the place, and calle
the Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that an-
swered that they wanted to s eak with them.

It happened that the day be ore, two of the Spaniards, having
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom
for distinction Icalled the honest men, and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had
met with from their three countrymen, and how they had
ruined their plantation, and destroyed their corn that they had
labored so hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat
and their three kids, which was all they had provided for their
sustenance; and that if he and his friends, meaning the Span-
iards, did not assist them again, they should be starved.
When the Spaniards came home at night, and they were all at
supper, _one of them took the freedom to reprove the three
Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly terms, and
asked them how they could be so cruel, they being harmless,
inoffensive fellows; that they were putting themselves in a
way to subsist by their labor, and that it had cost them a
great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they
were then in.
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, "What had
they to do there? that they came on shore without leave ; and
that the should not plant or build upon the island ; it was
none of their ground." " Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly,
"Seignior Inglese, they must not starve." The Englishmen
replied, like a rough-hewn tar aulin , " They might starve ;
they should not plant nor buil in t at place." " But what
must they do then, seirrnior i" said the Spaniard. Another of
the brutes returned, " ho ? they should be servants, and work
for them." " But how can you expect that of them ? "
says the Spaniard ; " they are not bought with your money ;
you have no right to make them servants." The Englishman an-
swered, " The island was theirs ; the governor had given it to
them, and no man had an thing to do there but themselves " ;
and with that, swore by his Maker that they would go and burn
all their new huts; they should build none upon their land.
" Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, " by the same rule, we
must be servants too." "Ay," says the bold dog, "and so you
shall, too, before we have done with you " ; mixing two or
three oaths in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
onl smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this
litt e discourse had heated them ; and starting up, one says to
the other (I think it was he they called Will Atkins), " Come,
Jack, let's go and have t'other brush with them ; we'll demolish
their castle, I'll warrant you ; they shall plant no colony in
our dominions." -

Upon this, they went all troopin away, with every man a gun,
a pistol, and a sword, and muttere some insolent things among
themselves of what they would do to the Spaniards too, when
opportunity ofiered; but the S aniards, it seems, did not so
perfectly understand them as to 'now all the particulars, only
that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the two
Englishmen's part.

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it seems
they wandered about the count part of the night, and then,
lying down in the place which used to call my bower, they
were weary and oversle t themselves. The case was this ; they
had resolved to stay til midnight, and so to take the two car
men when the were asleep, and, as they acknowledged agter-
ward, intende to set fire to their huts while they were in them,
and either burn them there, or murder them as they came out.
As malice seldom slee s very sound, it was very strange they
should not have been ept awake.

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and
murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, that
they were up and gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues
came to their huts.

When they came there and found the men gone, Atkins,
who it seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrade,
" Ha, Jack, here's the nest, but the birds are flown." They
mused a while to think what should be the occasion of their
being gone abroad so soon, and sug ested presently that the
Spaniards had given them notice 0% it; and with that they
shook hands, and swore to one another that they would be re-
venged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody
bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's habitation ; they
did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but they pulled down both
their houses, and pulled them so limb from limb that they left
not the least stick standing, or scarce an sign on the ground
where they stood ; they tore all their litt e collected household
stufl in pieces, and threw everything about in such a manner,
that the oor men afterwards found some of their things a mile
ofi their abitation. When they had done this, they pulled up
all the young trees which the poor men had planted ; pulled up
an inclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their
corn ; and, in a word,sacked and plundered everything as com-
pletely as a horde of Tar-tars would have done.

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them out,
and had resolved to fight them wherever the had been, though
they were but two to three ; so that, had t ey met there cer-
tainly would have been bloodshed among them, for they were
all very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due.

But Providence took more care to keep them assunder than
they themselves could do to meet ; for, as if they had dogged
one another, when the three were gone thither, the two were
here ; and afterwards, when the two went back to find them,
the three were come to the old habitation again ; we shall see
their different conduct presently. "When the three came back
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the work
they had been about had put them into, they came up to the
Spaniards and told them what they had done, by way of scofl
and bravado ; and one of them, stepping up to one of the S an-
iards-as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes old
of his hat as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about,
fleerin in his face, says to him, "And you, Seignior Jack Span-
iard, s all have the same sauce if you do not mend your man-
ners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil man, was as
brave a man as could be, and, withal, astrong, well-made man,
looked at him for a good while, and then, having no weapon in
his hand, step ed gravely up to him, and, with one blow of his
fist, knocked 'him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-ax ; at
which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired his istol
at the Spaniard immediately 2 he missed his body, indee , for
the bullets went through his hair, but one of them touched the
tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood made the
Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really was, and that

ut him into some heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm ;
but now, resolving to go through with his work, he stooped,
and took the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, and
was just going to shoot the man who had fired at him when
the rest of the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and call-
ing to him not to shoot, the stepped in, secured the other two,
and took their arms from t rem.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made
all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own country-
men, they be an to cool, and, giving the Spaniards better
words, wouldfiiave had their arms again ; but the Spaniards
considering the feud that was between them and the other
two En Iishmen, and that it would be the best method they
could ta e to keep them from killing one another, told them
they would do them no harm ; and if they would live peace-
ably, they would be very willing to assist and associate with
them, as they did before ; but that they could not think of
giving them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved
to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had
even threatened them all to make them their servants.

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than
to act with reason ; but being refused their arms, they went
raving awa , and ragin like madmen, threatening what they
would do, t ough they ad no firearms. But the Spaniards,
despising their threatening, told them they should take care
how they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle; for
if they did, they would shoot them as they would ravenous
beasts, wherever they found them; and if they fell into their
hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. However, this
was far from cooling them, but away the went, raging and
swearing like furies of hell. As soon as t ey were gone, the
two men came back, in passion and rage enough also, though
of another kind; for having been at their plantation, and find-
ing it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be
supposed they had rovocation enough. They could scarce
have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to
tell them theirs ; and it was strange enough to find that three
men' should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at
all.

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having
thus disarmed them, made li ht of their threatenings ; but
the two Englishmen resolve to have their remedy against
them, what pains soever it cost to find them out. But the
Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, that as they had
disarmed them, they could not consent that they (the two)
should pursue them with firearms, and erhaps kill them.
" But," said the grave Spaniard who was t eir governor, " we
will endeavor to make them do you justice, if you will, leave
it to us : for there is no doubt but they will come to us again,
when their passion is over, being not able to subsist without
our assistance. We promise you to make no peace with them
without having a full satisfaction for you; and, upon this con-
dition, we hope you will promise to use no violence with them,
other than in your own defense." The two Englishmen yielded
to this very awkwardly, and with great reluctance; but the
S aniards protested that they did it only to keep them from
b oodshed, and to make them all easy at last. "For," said
they, " we are not so many of us ; here is room enough for us
all and it is a great pity that we should not be all good friends."
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue of the
thing, living for some days with the Spaniards ; for their own
habitation was destroyed.

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with
wandering, and almost starved with him er, having chiefly
lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came ack to the grove;
and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the gover-
nor, and two more with him, walking by the side of the creek,
they came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and begged
to be received again into the famil . The Spaniards used
them civilly, but told them they ha acted so unnaturally to
their countrymen, and so very grossly to them (the Spaniards),
that they could not come to any conclusion without consult-
ing the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they
would go to them and discourse about it, and they should
know in half an hour. It may be guessed that they were
very hard put to it; for, it seems, as they were to wait this
half hour for an answer, they begged they would send them out
some bread in the mean time, which they did, sending, at the
same time, a large piece of goat's flesh and a boiled parrot,
which they ate very heartily, for they were hungry enough.

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and
a long debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them
with the ruin of all their labor and a desi n to murder them;
all which they owned before, and there ore could not deny
now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them ; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen
not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed, so
they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellows'
two huts, one to be of the same and the other of larger dimen-
sions than they were before ; to fence their ground again
where they had ulled u their fences, plant trees in the
room of those pul ed up, ig up the land again for planting
corn where they had spoiled it, and, in a word, to restore
everything to the same state as they found it, as near as they
could ; for entirely it could not be, the season for the corn,
and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being possible to
be recovered.

Well, they submitted to all this; and, as they had plenty of
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderl ,
and the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeab y
together again ; only that these three fellows could never be
persuaded to work--I mean for themselves--except now and
then a little, just as they pleased ; however, the Spaniards told
them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly
together, and study the good of the whole plantation, they
would be content to work for them, and let them walk about
and be as idle as they pleased ; and thus, having lived pretty
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them
grips again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them as

e ore.

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and
went abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to be as
insolent and troublesome as ever ; but, however, an accident
happened presently upon this, which endangered the safety of
them all ; .and they were obliged to lay by all private resent--
ments, and look to the preservation of their lives.

It happened one night that the Spanish overnor, as I call
him--that is to say, the Spaniard whose life had saved--who
was now the captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, found
himself ve uneasy in the night, and could by no means get
any sleep : e was perfectly well in body, as he told me the
story, only found is thoughts tumultuous ; his mind ran
upon men fighting and killing one another ; but he was broad
awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in short
he lay a great while, but, growin more and more uneasy, he
resolved to rise. As they Iayfiieing so many of them, on
goat-skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they
made for themselves, and not in hammocks and ship-beds as I
did, who was but one, so they had little to do, when they were
willing to rise, but to get upon their feet, and perhaps put on
a coat, such as it was, and their pumps, and they were ready
for going any way that their thoughts guided them. Being
thus got up, he looked out ; but, bem dark, he could see little
or nothing ; and, besides, the trees w ich I had planted, as in
my former account is described, and which were now grown
ta 1, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and
see that it was a clear starlight night, and, hearin no noise,
he returned and laid him down again ; but it was a 1 one : he
could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything
like rest; but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy,
and he knew not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking about,
goin out and coming in, another of them waked, and, calling,
aske who it was that was up. The governor told him how it
had been with him. "Say you so ? " sa s the other Spaniard ;
"such things are not to be slighted, assure you; there is
certainly some mischief working near us"; and presentl he
asked him, " Where are the Englishmen?" "They are a l in
their huts," says he, " safe enough." It seems the Spaniards
had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a
place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny,
were always uartered by themselves, and could not come at
the rest. " ell," says the Spaniard, " there is something
in it, I am persuaded from my own experience. I am satis-
fied our spirits embodied have a converse with and receive in-
telligence from the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the in-
visible world ; and this friendly notice is given for our advan-
tage,if we knew how to make use of_ it. Come," says he, "let
us go and look abroad ; and if we find nothing at all in it to
justify the trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose that
shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it."

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill,
where I used to go ; but they being strong, and a good com-

any, not alone, as I was, used none of my cautions, to go up

y the ladder, and pulling it up after them, to go up a second
stage to the top, but were going round through the grove, un-
concerned and unwary, when they were surprised With seeing
a light as of fire, a very little way ofi from them, and hearing
the voices of men--not of one or two, but of a great number.

'In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making
the least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the
place ; and when by any occasion they came to know it, they
elt it so effectually that they that got away were scarce able
to give my account of it ; for we disappeared as soon as possi-
ble ; nor id ever any that had seen me escape to tell anyone
else, except it was the three savages in our last encounter, who
jumped into the boat ; of whom, I mentioned, I was afraid
they should go home and bring more help. Whether it was
the consequence of the escape of those men that so great a
number came now together, or whether they came ignorantlg,
and by accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniar s
could not, it seems, understand ; but, whatever it was, it had
been their business either to have concealed themselves, or not
to have seen them at all, much less to have let the savages have
seen that there were any inhabitants in the place ; or to have
fallen upon them so efiectually as that not a man of them should
have escaped, which could only have been by getting in between
them and their boats ; but this presence of mind was wantin to
them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a reat whi e.
We need not doubt but that the governor and t ie man with
him, sur rised with this sight, ran back immediately and raised
their fel ows, giving them an account of the imminent danger
they were all in, and they again as readily took the alarm ; but it
was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where
"1% were, but the must all run out to see how things stood.
hile it was ark, indeed, they were well enou h, and
they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to view t em by
the light of three fires they had made at a distance from one
another; what they were doing they knew not, and what to
do themselves they knew not. For, first, the enemy were too
man ; and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were
divi ed into several parties, and were on shore in several
aces.
p The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight ;
and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the
shore, they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them
would chop in upon their habitation or upon some other place
where they would see the token of inhabitants ; and they were
in great per lexit also for fear of their flock of goats, which
would have een ittle less than starving them, if they should
have been destroyed ; so the first thing the resolved upon was
to dispatch three men aWay before it was ight, two S aniards
and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to t e great
valley where the cave was, and, if~need were, to drive them in-
to the very cave itself. Could they have seen the savages all
together in one body, and at a distance from their canoes,
they resolved, if there had been a hundred of them, to have
attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, for they were
some of them two miles off from the others ; and, as it appeared
afterward, were of two difierent nations.

After having mused a great while on the course they should
take, and beating their brains in considering their present cir-
cumstances, they resolved, at last, while it was still dark, to
send the old savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if
possible, something concerning them--as what they came for,
what the intended to do, and the like. The old man readily
undertoo it; and, strip ing himself quite naked, as most of
the savages were, away e went. After he had been one an
hour or two, he brings word that he had been amongt em un'
discovered ; that he found they were two arties, and of two
several nations,-who had war with one anot er, and had had a
great battle in their own country; and that both sides hav-
ing had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by
mere chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring
their prisoners and makin merry; but their coming so by
chance to the same place ha spoiled all their mirth--that they
were in a great rage at one another, and were so near that
he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began
to appear ; but he did not perceive that they had any notion
of anybod being on the island but themselves. He had
hardly ma e an end of telling his story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.

Friday's father used all the ar uments he could to persuade
our people to lie close, and not e seen; he told them their
safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie
still, and the savages would kill one another to their hands,
and then the rest would go away; and it was so to atittle.
But it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the English-
men ; their curiosity was so irnportunate upon their prudentials,
that they must run out and see the battle ; however, they used
some caution, too ; they did not go o enly, just by their own
dwelling, but went farther into the woo s, and placed themselves
to advantage, where they might securely see them manage the
fight, and, as they thought, not be seen by them ;but it seems
the savages did see them, as we shall find hereafter.

The battle was very fierce; and, if I might believe the Eng-
lishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some of them
were men of reat bravery, of invmcible s irits, and of great

olicy in guiding the fight." The battle, t ey said, held two
hours before they could guess which party would be beaten 5
but then that 'party which was nearest our people's habitation
began to appear weakest, and after some time more, some of
them began to fly; and this put our men again into a great
consternation, lest anyone of those that fled should run into
the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involun-
tarily discover the place; and that, by conse uence, the ur-
suers would do the like_in search of them. pon this, t Iey
resolved that the would stand armed within the wall, and who-
ever came into t Ie grove, they resolved to sally out over the
wall, and kill them, so that, if possible, not one should return
to give an account of it; they ordered also that it should be
done with their swords, or by knocking them down with the
stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear of
raising an alarm by the noise.

As they expected it fell out ; three of the routed army fled
for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not
in the least knowin whither they went, but running as into a
thick wood for she ter. The scout they kept to look abroad
gave notice of this within, with this addition, to our men's
great satisfaction, viz., that the conquerors had not pursued
them, or seen which way they were gone; upon this, the Span-
iard governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill
the three fu itives, but sendin three men out by the top of the
hill, order-emf them to go round, come in behind them, and sur-
prise and take them prisoners 3 which was done. The residue
of the conquered eople fled to their canoes, and got off to sea;
the victors retired: made no pursuit, or very'little, but drawing
themselves'into a body together gave two great screamin shouts
which they supposed was b way of triumph--and so t e fight
ended: and the same day, a out three o'clock in the afternoon,
they also marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had the island again free to themselves, their fright was over,
and they saw no savages for several years after.

After they were al gone, the Spaniards came out of their
den, and viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-
thirty men dead on the spot; some were killed with great long
arrows, some of which were found stickin in their bodies ; but
most of them were killed with great woo en swords, sixteen or
seventeen of which they found on the field of battle, and as
many bows, with a great many arrows. These swords were
strange great unwieldy things, and they must be very stron
men that used them ; most of those men that were killed wit
them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several their
arms and legs broken 5 so that it is evident they fight with in~Ta: SPAxumvs VIEW THE FIELD or Bitmap--Page 270.
expressible rage and fury. We found not one man that was
not stone dead; for either the stay by their enem till they
have killed him, or they carrya the wounded men t at are not
quite dead away with them.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while ;
the sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences
appeared terrible to the last degree, especiall upon supposing
t lat some time or other they should fal into t e hands of those
creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies, but kill
them for food, as we kill our cattle; and they professed to me
that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef and mutton, though
it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had some-
thing in it so horrible that it nauseated their very stomachs,
made them sick when they thought of it, and filled their minds
with such unusual terror that they were not themselves for some
weeks after. This, as I said, tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of ; and for a great while after
they were tractable, and went about the common business of
the whole society well enough--planted, sowed, reaped, and be-
gan to be all naturalized to the country. But some time after
this they fell into such simple measures again, as brought them
into a great deal of trouble.

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these
three being lusty, stout young fellows, they made them servants,
and taught them to work for them ; and as slaves they did well
enough ; but the did not take their measures with them as I
did by my man A riday, via, to begin with them upon the prin-
ciple of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the
rational principles of life, much less of religion--civilizing and
reducing them by kind usa e and affectionate arguments ; but
as they gave them their foo every day, so they gave them their
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudger enough ;
but they failed in this by it, that they never had t em to as-
sist them and fight for them as I had my man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very flesh upon in bones.

But to come to the family art. Being a 1 now ood friends,
for common danger, as I sai above, had efiectual y reconciled
them, they began to consider their general circumstances; and
the first t ing that came under consideration was whether, see-
ing the'savages particularly haunted that side of the island,
and that there were more remote and retired arts of it e ually
adapted to their way of living, and manifest y to their a van-
tage, they should not rather move their habitation, and plant in
some more proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn.
U on this, after lon debate, it was concluded that they
won d not remove their abitation ; because that, some time or
other, they thought they might hear from their governor again,
meaning me ; and if I should send anyone to seek them, I should
be sure to direct them to that side, where, if they should find
the lace demolished, they would conclude the savages had
kille us all, and we were gone, and so our supply would go
too. But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the valley where my cave was, where the land was
as proper for both, and where, indeed, there was land enough ;
however, upon second thoughts, they altered one part of t ieir
resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cattle
thither, and plant part of their corn there; and so if one part was
destroyed, the other might be saved. And one part of prudence
they used, which it was very well they did, that they never
trusted those three savages, which they had taken prisoners,
with knowing anything of the plantation they had made in
that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less of the
cave there, which they kept, in case of necessity, as a safe re-
treat; and thither they carried also the two barrels of powder,
which I had sent,them at my coming away. But, however, they
resolved not to change their habitation ; yet they a reed, that as
I had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and
then with a grove of trees, so seeing their safety consisted en-
tirely in their being concealed, of wh 1ch they were now fully con-
vinced, they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more
effectually than before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or
rather thrust in stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees,
for some good distance before the entrance into my apartments,
they went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of that
whole space of ground from the trees I had set quite down to
the side of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my floats, and
even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as
leaving any place to land, or an sign that there had been any
landing thereabouts; these sta es also being of a wood very
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took care to
have them generally much larger and taller than those which I
had planted ; and as they grew apace, so they lanted them so
very thick and close together, that when they lad been three
or four years grown, t ere was no piercing with the eye any
considerable way into the plantation; and as for that part
which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's
thigh, and among them the placed so many other short ones,
and so thick, that, in a war , it stood like a palisado a quarter
of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it,{pa--WW."

but with a little army to cut it all down--for a little dog could
hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.

But this was not all ; for they did the same b all the
ground to the right hand and to the left, and man even to
the side of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for them-
selves to come out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of
the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from the first
stage up to the top ; and when the ladder was taken down,
nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could
come' at them. This was excellently well contrived ; nor was
it less than what they afterwards found occasion for, which
served to convince me, that as human prudence has the author-
itfv of Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless the direction
0 Providence to set it to work ; and if we listened carefully
to the voice of it, I am ersuaded we might prevent many of
the disasters which our ives are now, by our own negligence,
subjected to.

I return to the story. They lived two years after this in
erfect retirement, and had no more visits from the savages.
hey had, indeed, an alarm given them one morning, which

put them into a great consternation ; for, some of the Span-
iards being out early one morning on the west side, or rather
end, of the island (which was that end where I never went, for
fear of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing
above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. They
made the best of their way home in hurry enough ; and, iv-
ing the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that ay
and the next, going out only at night to make their observa-
tion : but they had the good luck to be mistaken, for wherever
the savages went, they did not land that time on the island,
but pursued some other design.

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen ;
one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one
of the three slaves, whom I mentioned they had taken,beeause
the fellow had not done something right which be bid him do,
and seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a
hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and
fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.
One of .the Spaniards, who was by, seein him give the fellow
a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which Iie aimed at his head,
but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the
poor creature's arm of, ran to him, and entreatin him not to
murder the poor man, placed himself between im and the
savage, to prevent the mischief. The fellow, being enraged
the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and
swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage;
which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a
shovel which he had in his hand (for they were all working in
the field about their corn land) knocked the brute down.
Another of the Englishmen, running at the same time to help
his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down ; and then two Span-
iards more came in to help the man, and a third Englishman
-fell in upon them. They had none of them any firearms or
any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this
third Englishman ; he had one of my rust cutlasses, with
which he made at the two last Spaniards, an wounded them
both. This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and, more
help coming in, they took the three Enorlishmen prisoners. The
next question was, what should be done with them? They
had been so often mutinous, and were so very furious, so des-
perate, and so idle withal, they knew not what course to take
with them, for they were mischievous to the highest degree,
and cared not what hurt they did to any man: so that, in
short, it was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many
words, that if they had been of his own country, he would
have hanged them, for all laws and all governors were to pre-
serve society, and those who were dangerous to the society
ought to be expelled out of it ; but as they were Englishmen,
an that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would
use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the
judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were their country--
men.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they
desired it might not be left to them--" For," says he, "I am
sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows ;" and with
that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three,
had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join to ether,
and murder all the Spaniards when they were in their gee .

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to 'R'ill
Atkins, "How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all?
What have you to say to that ?" The hardened villain was
so far from denying it that he said it was true, and swore
they would do it still before they had done with them.
" Well, but, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " what have
we done to you that you will kill us? And what would you
get by killing us? And what must we do to prevent your
killing us ? Must we kill yon,or you kill us? \Vhy will you
put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" says the
Spaniard, very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such
a rage at the Spaniard's making a 'est of it, that, had he not
been held b three men, and wrtha had no weapon near him,
it was thong t that he would have attempted to kill the Spaniard
in the middle of all the company. This hair~brain carriage
obligid them to consider seriously what was to be done ; the
two 'nglishmen, and the S aniard who saved the poor savage,
were of the opinion that t ey should hang one of the three,
for an example to the rest, and that particularly it should be
he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet ;
and indeed, there was some reason to believe that he had done
it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with
the wound he had received, that it was thought he could not
live. But the governor Spaniard still said no ; it was an
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would never
consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had mur-
dered half of them ; nay, he said,if he had been killed himself
by an Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that
theyr should pardon him.

'lhis was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard,
that there was no gainsaying it ; and as merciful counsels are
most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly ressed, so
they a] came into it ; but then it was to be consi ered what
should be done to keep them from doin the mischief they de-
signed ; for all agreed, governor and a l, that means were to
be used for preserving the society from danger. Aftera long
debate, it was agreed, first, that they should be disarmed, and
not permitted to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any
weapon ; and should be turned out of the society, and left to
live where they would, and how they conld,b themselves;
but that none of the'rest, either Spaniards or nglish, should
converse with them, speak with them, or have anything to do
with them ; that they should be forbid to come within a cer-
tain distance of the place where the rest dwelt ; and if they
oifered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or de-
stroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle
belonging to the society, they should die without mercy, and
they would shoot them wherever they could find them.

he governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the
sentence, considered a little upon it ; and turning to the two
honest Englishmen, said, " Hold ; you must reflect that it will
be long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and
they must not starve; we must therefore allow them provi-
sions." So be caused to be added that they should have a
proportion of corn given them to last them eight months, and
for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to raise
some of their own ; that they should have six milch-goats,
four he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for present
subsistence as for a store; and that they should have tools
given them for their work in the fields, such as six hatchets,
an adze,a saw, and the like ; but they should have none of
these tools or rovisions unless they would swear solemn]
that they won] not hurt or in'ure any of the Spaniards with
them, or of their fellow-Englis men.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out
to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refrac-
tory, as neither content to go away, nor to stay; but, as there
was no remedy, they went, pretendin to go and choose a
place where they would settle themse ves; and some provi-
sions were given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after, they came again for some
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation
and plantation, and it was a very convenient place indeed, on
the remotest art of the island, N.E., much about the lace
where I provi entiall landed in my first voya e, when was
driven out to sea, the 0rd knows whither, in my oolish attempt
to sail round the island.

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived
them in a manner like my first habitation, being close under
the side of a hill, having some trees growing already on three
sides of it, so that by planting others it would be very easily
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for. The
desired some dried goatskins, for beds and coverin , whic
were given them ; and upon giving their words t at they
would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations,
they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they could
Spare ; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing, and, in a word,
anything they wanted, except arms and ammunition.

They ived in this se arate condition about six months, and
had got in their first harvest, though the quantity was but
small, the parcel of land they had planted bein but little ; for
indeed, having all their lantation to form, tiey had a great
deal of work upon their lands; and when they came to make
boards and ots, and such things, they were uite out of their
element, and) could make nothing of it; an when the rainy
season came on,for want of a cave in the enrth;they could not
keep their grain dr ', and it was in rent danger of spoiling ;
and this humbled t em much : so t ey came and begged t 1e
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did 3 and in
four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them,
big enough to secure their corn and other things from the
rain : but it was a poor place, at best, compared to mine, and
especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly en-
larged it, and made several new apartments in it.

bout three-quarters of a ear after this separation, a new
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former vill-
ain the had committed, brought mischief enough upon them,
an ha very near been the ruin of the whole colon . The
three new associates began, it seems, to be wea of t e labo-
rious life they led, and that without hope of ettering their
circumstances : and a whim took them that they would make
a v0 age to the continent, from whence the savages came, and
won (1 try if they could seize upon some prisoners among the
natives there, and bring them home, so as to make them do the
laborious part of the work for them.

The prclg'ect was not so preposterous, if they had one no
farther. ut they did nothing, and pro osed nothing, ut had
either mischief in the design or misc ie in the event. And if
I may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from
Heaven ; for if we will not allowa visible curse to pursue vis-
ible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of t ings with
the Divine justice ? It was certainly an apparent vengeance
on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the
state they were in ; and they showed not the least remorse for
the crime, but added new villainies to it, such as the iece of
monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave because he id not,
or (perhaps could not, understand to do what he was directed,
an to wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple all
his life, and In a place where no surgeon or medicine could be
had for his cure ; and, what was still worse, the murderous in-
tent, or, to do justice to the crime, the intentional murder, for
such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the formed design
they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in
their sleep. '

But I leave observing, and return to the story. The three
fellows came down to the S aniards one morning, and in very
humble terms desired to e admitted to s eak with them.
The Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which
was this : That they were tired of livin in the manner they
did, and that they were not handy enougi to make the neces-
saries they wanted, and that havmg no ielp, they found they
should be starved ; but if the Spaniards would give them leave
to take one of the canoes which they came over in, and give
them arms and ammunition proportioned to their defense, they
would go over to the main and seek their fortunes, and so de-
liventhem from the trouble of supplying them with any other
prowsions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction
they were running into; told them they had suffered such
hardships upon that ver spot, that they could, without any
spirit of rophec , tell t em they would be starved or mur-
dered, and, bade t em consider of it.

The men replied, audaciously, they should be starved if they
stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work, and
they could but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them ; and, in short, insisted importunately
upon their demand, declaring they would go, whether they
gave them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and
be in no condition to defend themselves; and that, though
they could ill spare their firearms, having not enough for them-
selves, yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol,
and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which the thought was
sufficient for them. In a word, they accepted t 1e ofier ; and
having baked bread enough to serve them a month, and given
them as much oats' flesh as they could eat while it was sweet,
and a great has et of dried grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a
young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage
over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well
have carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather
too big for them to managp; but as they had a fair breeze,
and flood-tide with them, t ey did well enough. They had
made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins
dried, which they had sewed or laced together ; and away they
went merrily enou h. The Spaniar s called after them,
"Ban veyajol" and no man ever thought of seeing them
an more.

'he Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to
the two honest En lishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comforta 1y they lived, now these three turbu-
lent fellows were gone. As for their coming again, that was
the remotest thing .from their thoughts that could be imag-
ined ; when, behold, after two~and-twenty days' absence, one
of the Englishmen, being abroad upon his planting work, sees
three strange men coming toward him at a distance, with
guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes
frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells
him they were all undone, for there were strangers upon the
island, but could not tell who they were. he Spaniard,
pausing a while, says to him, "How do on mean--you can-
not tell who? They are the savages, to e sure." "No, no,"
sa- 8 the Englishman ; "they are men in clothes, with arms."
" ay, then, ' says the Spaniard, "why are you so concerned?
If they are not savages, they must be friends, for there is no
hChristian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than

arm.

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen,
and, standing without the wood, which was new planted, hal-
looed to them. They presently knew their voices, and so all
the wonder ceased. But now the admiration was turned up-
on another question: What could be the matter, and what
made them come back again ?

It was not long before they brought the men in, and in-

uiring where they had been, and what they had been doing,
t ey gave them a full account of their voyage in a few
words : that they reached the land in two days, or somethin
less; but finding the eople alarmed at their coming, an
prepared with bows an arrows to fight them, they dnrst not

0 on shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven

ours, till they came to a great opening, by which they per-
ceived that t e land they saw from our island was not the
main but an island. Upon entering that opening of the sea,
they saw another island, on the right hand, north, and several
more west ; and being resolved to land somewhere, they put
over to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on
shore; that they found the people very courteous and friendly
to them ; and that they gave them several roots and some dried
fish, and appeared very sociable; and the women, as well as
the men, were very forward to supply them with anything
they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a
great way upon their heads.

They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as
they could of them, by si us, what nations were this way,
andthat way, and were tol of several fierce and terrible peo-
ple that lived almost every way, who, as they made known

y signs to them, used to eat men: but as for themselves,
they said, they never ate men or women, exce t only such as
they took in the wars; and then, they owned, they made a
great feast, and ate their prisoners.

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of
that kind ; and they told them about two moons ago, point-
ing to the moon and to two fingers; and that their great
king had two hundred risoners now, which he had taken in
his war, and they were eeding to make' them fat for the next
feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing
those risoners; but the others mistaking them, thou ht they
were esirous to have some of them to carry away or their
own eating. So they beckoned to them, ointing to the set<<
ting of the sun, and then to the rising; w ich was to signify
that the next morning at sun-rising they would bring some
for them; and, accordingly, the next morning they brought
down five women and eleven men, and gave them to the
Englishmen, to carry with them on their voyage, just as we
would bring so many cows and oxen down to a seaport town
to victual a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the
highest afiront to the savage gentry that could be ofl'ered
them ; and what to do with them they knew not. However,
after some debate they resolved to accept of them; and, in
return, they gave the savages that brought them one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their bullets;
which, though they did not understand their use, they seemed
particularly pleased with ; and then tying the poor creatures'

ands behm them, they dragged the prisoners into the boat
for our men. .

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as
they had them, or else they that gave them this noble present
would certainly have e ected that they should have gone to
work with them, have illed two or three of them the next
morning, and, perhaps, have invited the donors to dinner.
But having taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks
that could well pass between people, where, on either side,
the understood not one word they could say, they put of
wit their boat, and came back towards the first island;
where, when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners
at liberty, there being too many of them for their occasion.

In their voyage they endeavored to have some communi-
cation with t eir prisoners; but it was impossible to make
them understand anything. Nothing they could say to them,
or give them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going
to murder them. They first of all unbound them; but the
poor creatures screame at that, especially the women, as if
they had just felt the knife at their throats; for they im-
mediate] concluded they were unbound on purpose to be
killed. ff they gave them anything to eat, it was the same
thing; they then concluded it was for fear the should sink
in flesh, and so not be fat enou h to kill. If t ey looked at
one of them more particular] , t e party presentl concluded
it was to see whether he or s e was fattest, and ttest to kill
first; nay, after they had brought them quite over, and be-
gan to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they ex-
pected every day to make a dinner or supper for their new
masters. '

When the three wanderers had iven this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, t e Spaniard asked them
where their new family was; and being told that they had
brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huts,
and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they (the
Splaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the
w ole colon , resolved to go all down to the place and see
them; and 'd so, and Friday's father with them.

When they came into the hut, there the sat, all bound;
for when they had brought them on shore, t ey bound their
hands, that they might not take the boat and. make their
escape ; there,I say, they sat, all of them stark naked. First,
there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped,
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of
age; and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to
forty; two more not above four or five and twenty; and the
fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The
women were well-favored, agreeable ersons, both in shape
and features, only tawny; and two 0 them, had they been
perfectly white, would have passed for very handsome women,
even in London itself, having pleasant, agreeable counte-
nances, and of a ver modest behavior ; especially when they
came afterwards to e clothed and dressed, as they called it,
though that dress was very indifierent, it must he confessed.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our
Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character, men of
the best behavior, of the most calm, sedate tempers, and per-
fect good humor, that ever I met with ;' and, in particular, of
the most modesty ; I say, the sight was very uncouth, to see
three naked men and five naked women, all together bound,
and in the most miserable circumstances that human nature
could be supposed to be, viz., to be expecting every moment
to be dragged out, .and have their brains knocked out, and
then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Fri-'
day's father, to go in, and see, first, if he knew an of them,
and then if he understood any of their speech. s soon as
the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew
none of them ; neither could any of them understand a word
he said, or a sign he could make, exce t one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer t e end, which was to
satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen
were Christians; that they abhorred eating men or women ;
and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As
soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a 'oy,
and by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is bar to
describe ; for it seems they were of several nations.

The woman who was their inte reter was bid, in the next
place, to ask them if they were wi ling to be servants, and to
work for the men who had brought them away to save their
lives ; at which they all fell a-dancing; and presently one fell
to taking up this, and another that, anything that'lvaly next,
to clan-y on their shoulders, to intimate they were ' ling to
war .

The governor, who found that the having women among
them would presently be attended with some inconvenience,
and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the
three men what they intended to do with these women, and
how they intended to use them, whether as servants or as
wives? One of the Englishmen answered, ve boldly and
readily, that they would use them as both ; to w ich the gov-
ernor said, "I am not going to restrain you from it--you are
your own masters as to that ; but this I think is but just, for
avoiding disorders and uarrels among you, and I desn'e it of
you for that reason on y, viz. :---That you will all enga e,
that if any of you take any of these women as a wife, that e
shall take but one ; and that, having taken one, none else shall
touch her; for thou h we cannot marry any one of you, yet
it is but reasonable t at, while you stay here, the woman any
of you takes shall be maintained by the man that takes her,
and should be his wife--I mean," says he, " while he continues
here, and that none else shall have anything to do with her."
All this appeared so just that everyone agreed to it without
an difficult .

en the n lishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed
to take any of t em. But every one of them answered, " No."
Some of them said they had wives in Spain, and the others
did not like women that were not Christians ; and all to ether
declared that they would not touch one of them, whic was
an instance of such virtue as I have not met with in all my
travels. On the other hand, to be short, the five Englishmen
took them every one a wife--that is to say, a tem orary wife ;
and so they set up a new form of living; for t e Spaniards
and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which the
had enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants whic
were taken in the last battle of the savages lived with them ;
and these carried on the main part of the colony, supplied all
the rest with food, and assisted them in anything as they
could, or as the found necessity required.

But the won er of the story was, how five such refractory,
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and that
two of them should not choose the same woman, especially
seeing two or three of them were, without com arison, more
agreeable than the others; but they took a goo way enough
to prevent uarreling among themselves, for they set the five
women by t emselves, in one of their huts, and the went all
into the other hut, and drew lots among. them w 0 should
choose first.

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the
but where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her
he chose ; and it was worth observing, that he that chose first
took her that was reckoned the homeliest and oldest of the
five, which made mirth enough among the rest ; and even the
Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow considered better
than any of them, that it was application and business they
were toex ect assistance in, as much as in anything else ; and
she rove the best wife of all the parcel.

hen the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus,
and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition re-
turned upon them again, and they firmly believed the were
now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the Ehiglish
sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their leave
of he: with such agonies and affection as would have rieved
the hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible or the
Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to he imme-
diately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's
father, who immediately let them know that the five men,
who, were to fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for
their wives.

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was
a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came
and helped them; and in a few hours they had built them
every one a new hut or tent for their lod ing apart; for those
they had already were crowded with t air tools, household
stufi, and provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched
farthest OE, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on the
north shore of the island, so that they continued separated as
before ; and thus my island was peopled in three places, and,
as I might say, three towns were e an to be built.

And here it is very well worth 0 servin that,.as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends 0 God's rovidence
are in such a dis osition of things, I cannot say , the two
honest fellows ha the two worst wives; and the three repro-
bates, that were scarce worth hangin , that were fit for noth-
ing, and neither seemed born to do t lemselves good nor any
one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious
wives; not that the first two were bad wives, as to their
temper or humor, for all the five were most willing, quiet,

asslve, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than Wives ;
ut my meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or
industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the honor of a diligent
application on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful,
negligent, idle temper on the other, that when I came to the
place, and viewed the several improvements, plantings, and
management of the several little colonies, the two men had so
far out one the three, that there was no comparison. They
had, in eed, both of them as much ground laid out for corn as
they wanted, and the reason was, because, according to my
rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
com than they wanted; but the difierence of the cultivation,
of the planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of everything else,
was easy to be seen at first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about
their huts, so that when you came to the place nothing was to
be seen but a wood; and though they had twice had their
plantation demolished, once by their own countrymen, and
once by the enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they had
restored all again, and everything was thriving and flourish-
ing about them : they had rapes lanted in order, and man-
aged like a vineyard, thong they lad themselves never seen
anything of that kind; and, by their good ordering their
vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the others.
They had also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest
part of the woods, where though there was not a natural cave,
as I had found, yet they made one with incessant labor of
their hands, and where, when the mischief which followed
happened, they secured their wives and children so as they
cou d never be found ; they having, by sticking innumerable
stakes and poles of wood which, as I said, grew so readily,
made the grove impassable, except in some places, where they
climbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on by
wa s of their own leaving.

8 to the three re robates, as I justly call them, though
they were much civi ized by their settlement compared to
what they were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having
not the same opportunity, yet one of the certain companions
of a profiigate mind never left them, and that was their idle-
ness. It is true, they planted corn, and made fences; but
Solomon's words were never better verified than in them : " I
went b the vineyard of the slothful, and it was all overgrown
with t iorns" ; for when the Spaniards came to view their
crop, they could not see it in some places for weeds, the hedge
had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten
up the corn ; perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed
in, to stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting
the stable door after the steed was stolen : whereas, when they
looked on the colony of the other two, there was the very face
of industry and success upon all they did; there was not a
weed to be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their
hedges ; and they, on the other hand, verified Solomon's words
in another place, that " the diligent hand maketh rich"; for
everything grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and
without ; they had more tame cattle than the others, more
utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure
and diversion too.

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and
cleanly within doors; and having learned the English ways
of dressing and cooking from one o the other Englishmen, who,
as I said, was a cook's mate on board the shi , they dressed
their husbands' victuals very nicel and well; whereas the
others could not be brought to un erstand it; but then the
husband, who, as I say, had been cook's mate, did it himself.
But as for the husbands of the three wives, they loitered about,
fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish and birds; in a word,
anything but labor; and they fared accordingly. The dill.
gent lived well and comfortably, and the slothful hard and
beggarly ; and so, I believe, generally speaking, it is all over
the warld.

But I now come to a scene difierent from all that had hap-
pened before, either to them or to me ; and the origin of the
story was this : Early one morning, there came on shore five
or six canoes of Indians or savages--call them which you
please--and there is no room to doubt they came upon the 01d
errand of feeding upon their slaves; but that part was now so
familiar to the paniards, and to our men too, that they did
not concern themselves about it as I did ; but having been
made sensible, by their experience, that their only business was
to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by an of the
savages they would go 0E again quietly, when their business
was done, having, as yet, not the least notion of there being
any inhabitants in the island ; I say, having been made sensible
of this, they had nothing to do but give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and not show themselves ;
only placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when the
boats went to sea again. Tlns was, without doubt, very right;
but a disaster spoiled all these measures, and made it known
among the savages that there were inhabitants there ; which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony.
After the canoes with the savages were gone ofl', the Spaniards
peeped abroad again 5 and some of them had the curiosity to
go to the place where they had been, to see what they had
been doing. ' Here, to their great surprise, they found three
savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the round.
It was supposed they had either been so gor ed with t eir in-
human feast, that, like beasts, they were fa len asleep when
the others went, or they had wandered into the woods, and
did not come back in time to be taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and
perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it
happened, was with them, and his advice was asked, but he
professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves, they had
enough already; and as to killing them, there were none of
them inclined to do that : the Spaniard governor told me, that
they could not think of shedding innocent blood ; for as to
them, the poor creatures had done them no wrong, invaded
none of their property, and they thought they had no just
quarrel against them to take away their lives. And here I
must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts
of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I
never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in
any foreign country, who were so universally modest, temper-
ate, virtuous, so very good-humored, and so courteous, as these
Spaniards : and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their
very nature : no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous pas-
sions; and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their hearing the
insufferable usage of the three Englishmen ; and their justice
and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages as above.ma: fivd--'suaxusmd auvm saovm/s mu,
After some consultation, they resolved u on this : that they
would lie still a while longer, till, if possi 1e, these three men
might be gone. But then the governor Spaniard recollected
that the three savages had no boat ; and if they were left to
roam about the island, they would certainly discover that there
were inhabitants in it; and so they should be undone that
way. Upon this, they went back again, and there la the fel-
lows fast asleep still, so they resolved to awaken t em and
take them risoners ; and they did so. The poor fellows were
strangely ri htened when they were seized upon and bound ;
and afraid, li e the women, that the should be murdered and
eaten: for it seems, those people t ink all the world do as
they do, eating men's flesh ; but they were soon made easy as
to that, and away they carried them. '

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them
home to their cast e--I mean, to my palace under the hill;
but they carried them first to the bower, where was the chief
of their country work, such as keeping the goats, the lanting
the corn, etc. ; and afterwards they carried them to t e habi-
tation of the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they
had for them to do; and whether it was b negligence in
guarding them, or that they thought the fe lows could not
mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran away, and,
taking to the woods, they could never hear of him any more.

They had good reasons to believe he got home again soon
after in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on
shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on
their revels as usual, went off in two days' time. This thought
terrified them exceedingly ; for they concluded, and that not
without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe
amon hlS comrades, he would certainly give them an account
that here were peo le in the island, and also how few and
weak they were ; or this savawe, as observed before, had
never been told, and it was very happy he had not, how many
there were, or where they lived 3 nor had he ever seen or
heard the fire of any of their guns, much less had they shown
him any of their at er retired places ; such as the cave in the
valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had
made, and the like.

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given in-
telligence of them was, that about two months after this, six
canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men in a
canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island, where
they never used to come before, and landed, about an hour
after sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the
habitation of the two Englishmen, where this esca ed man had
been ke t. As the Spaniard governor said, had t ey been all
there, t e damage would not have been so much, for not a
man of them would have escaped ; but the case differed now
very much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. The two
men had the happiness to discover them about a league 011', so
that it was above an hour before they landed ; and as they
landed a mile from their huts, it was some time before they
could come at them. Now, havimr great reason to believe
that they were betrayed, he first thing they did was to bind
the two slaves which were left, and cause two of the three
men whom they brou ht with the women (who, it seems,
proved very faithful tot em) to lead them, with their two wives,
and whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired
places in the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there
to bind the two fellows hand and foot, till they heard further.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore,
and that they had bent their course directly that wa , they
0 ened the fences where the milch cows were kept, an drove
t em all out ; leaving their goats to straggle in the woods
whither the pleased, that the savages might think they were
all bred w' d; but the rogue who came with them was too
cunnin for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they
went directly to the place.

When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives
and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who
came with the women, and who was at their place by accident,
away to the Spaniards with all s eed, to give them the alarm,
and desire s eedy help, and, in t )e meantime, they took their
arms, and w at ammunition they had, and retreated towards
the place in the wood where their wives were sent; kee ing
at a distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, w ich
wa the savages took.

' 'hey had not one far, but that from a rising ground they
could see the litt e army of their enemies come on direct] to
their habitation, and, in a moment more, could see all t eir
huts and household stufi flaming up together, to their great
grief and mortification; for they ad a ver great loss, to
them irretrievable, at least for some time. hey ke t their
station fora while, till they found the savages, like wil beasts,
spread themselves all over the place, rummaging every way,
and every place they could think of, in search of prey ; and In
particular for the people. of whom now it plainly appeared
they had intelligence. o
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not
secure where they stood, because it was likely some of the
wild people might come that way, and they might come too
many together, thought it proper to make another retreat
about half a mile farther; believmg, as it afterwards hap ened,
that the farther they strolled, the fewer would be toget er.

Their next halt was at the entrance into a ver thick-grown
part of the woods, and where an old trunk o a tree stood,
which was hollow and vastly large; and in this tree they both
took their standin , resolvmg to see there what might offer.
They had not stoo there long before two of the savages ap-
peared running directly that way, as if they already had notice
where they stood, and were coming up to attack them ; and a
little way farther they espied three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same way; besides
which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance, running
another way ; for, in a word, they ran every way, like sports-
men beating for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they
should stand and keep their posture, or y : but, after a very
short debate with themselves, they considered, that if the sav-
ages ranged the country thus before help eame, they might

erhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would
he lost ; so they resolved to stand them there, and if they were
too many to deal with, then they would get up to the to of
the tree, from whence they doubted not to defend thenise ves,
fire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, though all the
szvages that were landed, which was near fifty, were to attack
t em.

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether
they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so
take the middle party, by which the two and the five that
followed would be separated; at length they resolved to let
the first two pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree,
and come to attack them. The first two savages confirmed
them also in this resolution, by turnin a little from them
towards another part of the wood ; but t e three, and the five
after them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they had
known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so
straight towards them they resolved to take them in a line as
they came; and as the resolved to fire but one at a time, per-
haps the first shot mig t hit them all three ; for which purpose
the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into his
piece ; and having a fair loophole, as it were, from a broken hole
In the tree, he took. a sure aim, without being seen, waiting
till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he
could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they
plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that

ad escaped from them ; and they both knew him distinctly,
and resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, though they
should both fire; so' the other stood ready with his piece, that
if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a
second. But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim : for as the savages kept near one another, a little behind
in a line, he fired, and hit two of them directly ; the foremost
was killed outright, being shot in the head ; the second, which
was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and fell,
but was not uite dead ; and the third had a little scratch in the
shoulder, per maps by the same ball that went, through the body
of the second ; and being dreadfully frightened, thou b not so
much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming an yelling
in a hideous manner.

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise
than sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods
made the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was,
the echoes rattling from one side to another, and the fowls
rising from all arts, screaming and every sort makin a difi'er-
ent noise, accor ing to their kind ; just as it was when fired the
first gun that perhaps was ever shot 03 in the island.

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what
the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the
place where their companions lay in a condition miserable
enough ; and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible
that they were within reach of the same mischief, stood al-
together over the wounded man, talking, and, as may be sup-
posed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt; and who,
It is very rational to believe, told them, that a flash of fire first,
and immediately after that thunder from their gods, had killed
those two and wounded him; this, I say, is rational ; for nothing
is more certain than that, as they saw no man near them, so
they had never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as
heard of a gun ; neither knew they an thing of killing and
wounding at a distance with fire an buiiets ; if they had, one.
might reasonably believe the would not have stood so uncon-
cerned to view the fate of t eir fellows, without some appre-
hensions of their own.

Our two men, thou h, as they confessed to me, it grieved
them to be obliged to ill so many poor creatures, who, at the
same time, had no notion of their danger; yet, having them all
thus in their power, and the first having to load his piece again,
resolved to let flyboth together among them ; and smgling out,
by agreement, which to aim at, they shot together, and killed,
or very much wounded, four of them; the fifth, fri htened even
to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so t at our men,
seeing them all fall together, thought the had killed them all.

The belief that the savages were all illed made our two
men come hold] out from the tree before they had charged
their guns, which was a wronor ste ; and they were under some
surprise when they came to the p ace, and found no less than
four of them alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one
not at all; this obliged them to fall upon them with the
stocks of their muskets; and first they made sure of the run:
away savage, that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of
another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out of their

ain ; then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled

own to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous
moans to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could not
say one word to them that they could understand. However,
they made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard
by; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twine,
which he had b great chance in his pocket, tied his two hands
behind him, an there they left him ; and with what speed they
could made after the other two, which were gone before, fear-
ing they, or any of them, should find their way to the covered
place in the woods, where their wives and the few goods they

ad left lay. They came once in sight of the two men, but it
was at a great distance ; however, they had the satisfaction to
see them cross over a valley toward the sea, quite the contrary
way from that which led to their retreat, which they were
afraid of ; and being satisfied with that, they went back to the
tree where they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was
delivered by his comrades, for he was gone, and the two pieces
of rope- val-n, with which they had bound him, lay just at the
foot of t e tree. '

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what
number ; so they resolved to go away to the place where their
wives were, to see if all was well there, and to make them easy,
who were in fright enough to be sure; for though the savages
were their own countrymen, yet they were most terribly afraid
011: them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of
t em.

When they came there, they found the savages had been in
the wood, and very near that place, but had not found it ; for
it was indeed inaccessible from the trees standing so thick, un-
less the persons seeking it had been directed by those that
knew it, which these were not ; they found, therefore, every-
thing very safe, only the women in a terrible fright. While
they were here, they had the comfort to have seven of the
Spaniards come to their assistance ; the other ten, with their
servants, and old Friday I mean Friday's father), were gone
in a body to defend their ower, and the corn and cattle that
were kept there, in case the savages should have roved over
to that side of the country ; but they did not spread so far.
With the seven S aniards came one of the three savages, who,
as I said, were t ieir prisoners formerly; and with t rem also
came the savage whom the Englishmen had left bound hand
and foot at the tree; for it seems the came that way, saw
the slaughter of the seven men, and un ound the ei ht , and
brought him along with them; where, however, t ey were
obliged to bind him again, as they had done the two others
who were left when the third ran away.

The prisoners now began to be a burden to them ; and they
were so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving
to kill them all, believing they were under an absolute neces-
sity to do so for their own preservation. However, the Span-
iard governor would not consent to it, but ordered, for the
present, that they should be sent out of the wa , to m old
cave in the valle , and be kept there, with two Spaniard; to
guard them, an give them food for their subsistence, which
was done; and they were bound there hand and foot for that

nigil'ilt.
hen the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so en-
couraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any
lon er there ; but takin five of the Spaniards and themselves,
wit four muskets an a pistol among them, and two stout
uarterstaves, away they went in quest of the savages. And
rst they came to the tree where the men lay that had been
killed ; but it was easy to see that some more of the savages
had been there, for they had attempted to carry theirdead
men away, and had dra ged two of them a good way, but had
given it over. From t ienoe they advanced to the first risin
ground, where they had stood and seen their camp destroye ,
and where they had the mortification still to see some of the
smoke; but neither could they here see any of the savages.
They then resolved, though with all possible caution, to go for-
ward towards their ruine plantation ; but, a little before they
came thither, coming in sight of the seashore, they saw plainly
the savages all embarking again in their canoes, in order to be
gone. They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no way to
come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but, upon the
whole, they were very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help
them to rebuild, and assist them with needful supplies. Their
three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least
inclination to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for
they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till
all was over), came and offered their help and assistance, and
did, very friendly, work for several days to restore their habi-
tations, and make necessaries for them. And thus in a little
time they were set u on their legs again.

About two days a ter this they had the farther satisfaction
of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore,
and, at some distance from them, two drowned men, by which
they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at
sea, which had overset some of them ; for it had blown very
hard the night after they went off.

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand,
enou h of them escaped to inform the rest. as well of what
they ad done as of what had happened to them, and to whet
them on to another enterprise of the same nature, which they,
it seems. resolved to attempt, with suflicient force to carry all
before them ; for except what the first man had told them
of inhabitants, they could say little of it of their own know-
ledge, for they never saw one man ; and the fellow being
killed that had affirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm
it to them. .

It was five or six months after this before they heard any
more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they
had either forgot their former bad luck, or given over hopes
of better ; when, on a sudden, they were invaded by a most
formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full
of savages, armed with bows and'arrows, great clubs, wooden
swords, and such like engines of war; and they brought such
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the
utmost consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eastern-
most side of the island, our men had that night to consult and
consider what to do; and, in the first place, knowing that their
being entirely- concealed was their only safety before, and
would be much more so now, while the number of their enemies
would be so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take
down the huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and
drive away their goats to the old cave ; because they su posed
the savages woul go directly thither, as soon as it was a , to
play the old game over again, though they did not now and
within two lea ues of it. In the next place, they drove away
all the flocks o goats they had at the old bower, as I called it,
which belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little
appearance 0 inhabitants anywhere as was possible ; and the
next morning early they posted themselves, with all their force,
at the plantation of the two men, to wait for their coming. As
they guessed, so it happened : these new invaders, leaving their
canoes at the east end of the island, came ranging along the
shore, directly towards the place, to the number of two hundred
and fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our army was but
small, indeed ; but, that which was worse, they had not arms
for all their number neither. The whole account, it seems,
stood thus : first, as to men, seventeen S aniards, five English-
men, old Friday (or Friday's father), t 1e three slaves taken
with the women, who proved very faithful, and three other
slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had
eleven muskets, five pistols, three fowling-pieces, five muskets
or fowlin -pieces, which were taken by me from the mutinous
seamen w om I reduced, two swords, and three old halberts.

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee ;
but they had each ahalbert, or a long stafi, like a quarter-
staff, with a eat spike of iron fastened into each end of it,
and by his side. a hatchet ; also every one of our men had a
hatchet. Two of the women could not be prevailed upon, but
they would come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows,
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first
action happened, which I have spoken of, where the Indians
fought with one another; and the women had hatchets too.

The S aniard governor, whom I described so often, com-
manded t e whole ; and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful
fellow for wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, com-
manded under him. The savages came forward like lions: and
our men, which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage
in their situation ; only that Will Atkins, who now roved
a most useful fellow, With six men, was planted just be ind a
small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to
let the first of them pass by, and then fire into the middle of
them, and as soon as he had fired, so make his retreat as nimbly
as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind the
Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of trees before
17 rem.

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every
way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let
about fifty of them pass b him; then seeing the rest come in
a very thick throng, he or ered three of his men to fire, having
loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about
as big as a large pistol-bullets. How many they killed or
wounded they knew not, but the consternation and surprise
was inexpressible among the savages; they were frightened
to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their
men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it ; when,
in the middle of their fright, Will Atkins .and his other three
let fly again among the thickest of them ; and in less than a
minute, the first three being loaded again, gave them a third
volle .

Hayd Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as sooh
as they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest
of the bod been at hand, to have poured in their shot con-
tinually, t e savages had been efiectually routed ; for the
terror that was among them came principally from this, that
they were killed by the ads with thunder and lightning, and
could see nobody that art them; but Will Atkins, staying
to load again, discovered the cheat : some of the savages who
were at a distance spying them, came upon them behind ; and
thou h Atkins and his men fired at them also two or three times,
and 'lled above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet
they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one
Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who came with the
women. This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought
most desperate! , killing five of them with his own hand, hav-
ing no weapon at one of the armed staves and a hatchet.

Our men bein thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two
other men kille , retreated to arising ground in the wood;
and the Spaniards, after firing three volleys u on them, re-
treated also ; for their number was so great, an they were so
desperate, that though above fifty of them were killed, and
more than as many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of
our men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud ;
and it was observed that their wounded men, who were not
finite disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds and
ought like madmen.

When our men retreated, they left the S aniard and English-
man that were killed behind them; an the savages, when
they came up to them, killed them over a ain in a wretched
manner, breaking their arms, legs, and hen s, with their clubs
and wooden swords, like true savages; but finding our men
were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew them-
selves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted
twice, in token of their victory; after which, they had. the
mortification to see several of their wounded men fall, dying
with the mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up to-
gether upon a rising ground, At ins, though he was wounded,
would have had them march and charge again altogether at
once: but the Spaniard replied--"Seignior Atkins, you see
how their wounded men fight ; let them alone till mornin ;
all the wounded men will be stifi and sore with their wounds,
and faint with the loss of blood; and so we shall have the
fewer to engage." This advice was good: but Will Atkins
replied merrily, " That is true, seigmor, and so shall I too ;
and that is the reason I would go on while I am warm."
"Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you have be-
haved gallantly, and done your part; we will fight for you if
you cannot come on ; but I think it best to stay till morning ;"
so they waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men,
and a great noise and hurry among them where they lay, they
afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night ; especially
if they could come to give them but one volley before they
were discovered, which they had afair opportunity to do:
for one of the En lishmen in whose quarter it was where the
fight began, led t iem round between the woods and the sea-
side westward, and then turning short south, they came so
near where the thickest of them lay, that, before they were
seen or heard,eight of them fired in upon them, and did dread-
ful execution upon them ; in half a minute more, eight others
fired after them, pourin in their small shot in such a quantit ,
that abundance were ki led and wounded; and all this whi 9
they were not able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition,
and then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved
to fall in among them all together. They had in each body
eight persons, that is to say, twenty-two men, and the two
women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They divided
the firearms equally in each party, as well as the halberts and
staves. They would have had the women kept back, but they
said they were resolved to die with their husbands. Having
thus formed their little army, they marched out from among the
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and
hallooing as loud as they could ; the savages stood all to:
gether, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise
of our men shouting from three quarters together : they would
have fought if they had seen us ; for as soon as we came near
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday
was wounded, though not dangerous] ; but our men ave
them no time, but, running up to them, red among them t ree
ways, and then fell in With the butt-ends of their muskets,
their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and laid about them
so well, that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and
hovilrlling, flying to save their lives which way soever they
can .

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mor-
tally wounded in the two fights about one hundred and eighty
of them ; the rest, being frightened out of their wits, scoured
through the woods and over the hills, with all the speed fear
and nimble feet could help them to ; and as we did not trouble
ourselves much to ursue them, they got all together to the
seaside where they anded, and where their canoes lay. But
their disaster was not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible
storm of wind that evening from the sea, so that it was im-
possible for them to go off; nay, the storm continuin all
night, when the tide came up, their canoes were most of t em
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it
roquired infinite toil to get them off; and some of them were
even dashed to pieces against the beach, or against one an-
other.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest
that ni ht ; but having refreshed themselves as well as they
could, t ey resolved to march to that part of the island where
the savages were fled, and see what posture they were in.
This necessarily led them over the place where the fight had
been, and where they found several of the poor creatures not
quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable
enough to generous minds, for a truly great man, though
obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no
delight in his misery. However, there was no need to give any
orders in this case ; for their own savages, who were their
servants, despatched these poor creatures with their hatchets.

At length they came in view of the place where the more
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there ap-
peared about a hundred still ; their posture was generally sit-
ting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth,
alllld {be head put between the two hands, leaning down upon
t e nees.

When our men came within two musket-shots of them, the
Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired, without
ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that b their countenance he
might know what to expect, whether t ey were still in heart
to fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and dis-
couraged, and so he might manage accordingly. This strata-
gem took : for as soon as the savages heard the first gun, and
saw the flash of the second, they started up upon their feet in
the greatest consternation imaginable; and as our men ad-
vanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yelling awa , with a kind of howling noise, which our men
did not un erstand, and had never heard before; and thus
they ran up the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had been
calm, and they had all gone away) to sea ; but they did not
then consider that this might pro ably have been the occasion
of their coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted,
or, at least, to come so many and so often as would quite deso-
late the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who,
notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them, roved
the best counselor in this case; his advice was, to ta e the
advantage that ofiered, and step in between them and their
boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning
any more to plague the island.

They consulted long about this ; and some were against it
for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and live there
desperate, and so the should have them to hunt like wild
beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have their
plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed,
and, in short, he reduced to a life of continua distress.

\Vill Atkins told them they had better have to do with a
hundred men than with a hundred nations ; that as they must
destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of
them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed the ne-
cessity of it so plainly that they all came into it; so they went
to work immediately with the boats, and getting some dry
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them
on fire, but they were so wet that they would not burn ; how-
ever, the fire so bnrned the upper part that it soon made them
unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running out of the
woods, and coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled
down and cried, " Ca, Ca, Waramokoa l " and some other
words of their language, which none of the others understood
anything of ; but as they made dpitiful gestures and strange
norses, it was easy to understan they begged to have their
boats spared, and that they would be gone, and never come
there again. But our men were now satisfied that they had
no way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but
effectually to prevent any of these peo 1e from ever going
home again, depending upon this, that i even so much as one
of them got back into their countr to tell the story, the col-
ony was undone ; so that, letting t em know that they should
not have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and
destroyed every one that the "storm had not destroyed before ;
at the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the
woods, which our people heard plain enough, after which the
ran about the island like distracted men, so that, in a wor ,
our men did not really know what at first to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that
while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to
have he t a good guard at the same time upon their planta-
tions ; or though it is true they had driven away their cattle,
and the Indians did not find out their main retreat--I mean
my old cast-1e at the hill, nor the cave in the valley--yet they
found out in plantation at the bower, and pul ed it all to
pieces, and a l the fences and planting about it ; trod all the
corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just then
almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage, though
to themselves not one farthing's worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions,
yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them
up and down ; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men
when they found them single, so our men durst not go
abroad single, for fear of being surrounded with their numbers.
The best was, they had no weapons ; for though they had
bows, they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make any;
nor had they any ed e-tool or weapon among them.

The extremity an distress they were reduced to was great,
and indeed deplorable ; but, at the same time, our men were also
brought to very bad circumstances by them ; for though their
retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled, and what to do, or which wa to turn them-
selves, they knew not. The only refuge they h now was the
stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little
corn which rew there, and the plantation of the three English-
men, Will tkins and his comrades, who were now reduced to
two ; one of them being killed by an arrow, which struck him on
the side of his head, just under the tem less, so that he never
spoke more ;_and it was very remarka Is that this was the
same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage slave with his
hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have murdered the
Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time
than mine was at any time, after I first discovered the grains
of barley and rice, and got into the manner of lantin and
raising my corn, and my tame cattle ; for now t ey ha , as I
may say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour
everything they could come at, yet could be hardly come at
themselves.

When the saw what their circumstances were, the first thing
they conclu ed was, that they would, if possible, drive them up
to the farther part of the island, southwest, that if any more
savages came on shore they mi ht not find one another ; then,
that they would daily hunt an harass them, and kill as many
of them as they could come at, till the had reduced their
number ; and if they could at last tame t rem, and bring them
to anything, they would give them corn, and teach them how
to lant, and live upon their daily labor.

n order to do this, they so followed them and so terrified them
with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at
an Indian, If he did not hit him, yet'he would fall down for fear ;
and so dreadfully frightened they were that they kept out of
sightfarther and farther ; til], at last, our men fol owing them,
and almost every day killing or wounding some of them, they
kept up in the woods or hollow places so much that it reduced
them to the utmost misery for want of food ; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any hurt, abso-
lute] starved to death.

hen our men found this it made their hearts relent, and
pity moved them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was
the most gentleman--like generous-minded man that I ever
met with in my life ; and he proposed, if possible, to take one
of them alive, and bring him to understand what they meant,
so far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go among them
and see if they might be brought to some conditions that might
be depended upon, to save their lives and do us no harm.

It was some while before any of them could be taken ; but
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised
and made a prisoner. He was sullen at first and would neither
eat nor drink; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals
given to him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew
tractable, and came to himself. They brought old Friday to
him, who talked often with him, and told him how kind the
others would be to them all ; that they would not only save
their lives, but give them part of the island to live in, provided
they would give satisfaction that they would keep in their own
bounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prefudice others;
and that they should have corn given them to p ant and make
it grow for t eir bread, and some bread given them for their
present subsistence; and old Friday bade the fellow go and
talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they said to
it ; assurin them that, if they did not agree immediately, they
should be a l destroyed. _

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the pro osal at the
first ofier, and begged to have some food given t. em ; upon
which twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with
three Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to the place where
they were. The three Indian slaves carried them a lar e
quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in t e
sun, and three live goats ; and they were ordered to go to
the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate their provi-
sions ve thankful] , and were the most faithful fellows to
their wor s that cou d be thought of ; for, except when they
came to beg victuals and directions, they never came out of
their bounds ; and there they lived when I came to the island,
and I went to see them. _

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed
tame goats, and milk them ; they wanted nothing but wives,
and they soon would have been a nation. They were confined
to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them,
and lying lain toward the sea before them, on the southeast
corner of t e island. They had land enou h, and it was very
good and fruitful; about a mile and a ha broad, and three
or four miles in length.

Our men tau ht them to make wooden s ades, such as I
made for mysel , and gave among them twe ve hatchets and
three or four knives ; and there they lived, the most subjected,
innocent creatures that ever were heard of. .

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity, with
respect to the savages, till I came to re-visit them, which was
about two years after ; not but that, now and then, some canoes
of savages came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts ;
but as they were of several nations, and perhaps had never
heard of those that came before, or the reason of it, they did
not make any search or in uiry after their countrymen; and
if they had, it would have eeu very hard to have found them
out.

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that hap-
pened to them till my return, at least, that was worth notice.
The Indians or savages were wonderfully civilized by them,
and they frequently went among them ; but forbid, on pain of
death, any of the Indians coming to them, because they would
not have their settlement betrayed again. One thine was very
remarkable, viz., that they taught the savages to make wicker-
work, or baskets : but they soon outdid their masters ; for they
made abundance of most in enious thin s in wicker-work, par-
ticularly of all sorts of has ets, sieves, ird-cages, on boards,
etc., as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, an abund-
ance of other things ; being very ingenious at such work, when
they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because
we furnished them With knives, scissors, spades, shovels, ick-
axes, and all things of that kind which they could want. ith
the help of those tools, they were so very handy that they came
at last to build up their huts or houses very handsomely, rad-
dling or working it up like basket-work all the way round;
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuit ,and looked
very odd, but was an exceeding good fence, as wel against heat
as against all sorts of vermin ; and our men were so taken with
it, that the got the wild savages to come and do the like for
them ; so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's colon-
ies, they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived. like bees in a
hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very indus-
trious, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a
tent of basket-work as, I believe, was never seen ; it was one
hundred and twenty paces round on the outside, as I measured
it by my steps; the walls were as close worked as a basket, in
panels or squares of thirty-two in number, and very strong,
standing about seven feet hi h ; in the middle was another not
above twenty-two paces roun , but built stronger, being octagon
in its form, and in the ei ht corners stood eight very strong
posts ; round the top of w ich he laid strong pieces, pinned to-
gether with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for
a roof of eight rafters, very handsome, I assure you, and joined
together very well, though he had no nails, and only a few iron
spikes, which he made himself too out of the old iron that I had
left there ; and, indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingen-
uity in several things which he had no knowledge of : he made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire ;
he made himself charcoal for his work ; and he formed out of
the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon ; in this
manner he made many things, but especially hooks, staples
and s )ikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the house ;
after )0 had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he worked
it up between the rafters with basketwork, so firm, and
thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and
over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the to , that
his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slate . In-
deed, he owned that the savages had made the basket~work for
him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, all around this
inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-two an-

les to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty

eet distant, so that there was a s ace like a walk within the
outer wicker-wall, and without t e inner, near twenty feet
wide.

The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-
work, but much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that
he had six rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there
was a door; first into the entry, or coming into the main tent,
another door into the main tent, and another door into the
space or walk that was round it; so that walk was also divided
into six equal parts, which served not only for a retreat, but
to store up any necessaries which the family had occasion for.
These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what
other apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered : As
soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle, you had a
short passage straight before you to the door of the inner house ;
but on either side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by
which you went first into a lar e room, or storehouse, twenty
feet wide and about thirty feet ong, and through that into an-
other not quite so long, so that in the outer circle were ten
handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at through
the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets or retrr~
ing-rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle ; and
four large warehouses, or barns, or what you please to call them,
which went through one another, two on either hand of the
passa e, that led through the outer door to the inner tent.

Sue a piece of basket-work, I_ believe, was never seen in the
world, nora house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built.
In this reat bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say,
Will At ins and his companion ; the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children, for she was, it seems, bi
with child when he died; and the other two were not at al
backward to give the widow her full share of everything, I
mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, etc., and when they killed
a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well
enough ; though, it was true, they were not so industrious as
the other two, as has been observed already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that as for re-_.
ligion, I do not know that there was anything of that kind
anion them; they often, indeed, put one another in mind
that t ere was a God, by the very common method of seamen,
swearing by his name : nor were their poor ignorant savage
wives much better for having been married to Christians, as
we must call them ; for as they knew very little of God them-
selves, so they were utterly incapable of entering into any dis.
course with their wives about a god, or to talk anything to
them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the
wives had made from them was, that they had taught them to
speak English pretty well; and most of their children, who
were near twenty in all, were taught to speak English too,
from their first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There was none
of these children above six years old when I came thither, for
it was not much above seven years since they had fetched these
five savage ladies over ; but they had all been pretty fruitful,
for they had all children, more or less : I think the cook's mate's
wife was big of her sixth child ; 'and the mothers were all a
good sort of well-governed, quiet, laborious women, modest and

ecent, helpful to one another, mighty observant and subject
to their masters (I cannot call them husbands), and wanted
nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian religion, and
to be legall married ; both which were happily brought about
afterwards y my means, or at least in consequence of my com-
in among them.
aving thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my runagate English, I must say somethin of
the Spaniards, who were the mam bed of the family, an in
whose story there are some incidents a so remarkable enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their circum-
stances when the were among the savages. They told me
readily that they ad no instances to give of their application
or ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, miser-
able, dejected handful of people ; that if means had been
put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned themselves
to (ice air, and so sunk under the weight of their misfortune,
that t ey thou ht of nothing but starving. One of them, a
grave and sensi le man, told me he was convinced theywere
in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give
themselves up to their misery, but always to take hold of the
helps which reason offered, as well for present support as for
future deliverance : he told me that grief was the most sense-
less, insignificant passion in the world, for that it regarded
only things ast, which were generally impossible to be re-
called or to e remedied, but had no views of things to come,
and had no share in anythin that looked like deliverance,
but rather added to the afl'hction than roposed remedy;
and upon this he repeated a Spanish prover , which, though I
cannot repeat in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet
I remember I made it into an English proverb of my own, thus :

In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.

He ran on then in remarks upon all the improvements I had
made in my solitude ; my unwearied application, as he called
it ; and how I had made a condition, which in its circum-
stances was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand times
more happy than theirs was, even now when they were all to-
gether. e told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had
a greater presence of mind in their distress than any people
that ever he met with; that their unhapp nation and the
Portuguese were the worst men in the worl to struggle with
misfortunes ; for that their first step in dangers, after the com-
mon efiorts were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and die
without rousin their thoughtsup to proper remedies for escape.

I told him t ieir case and mine difiered exceedingly ;<< that
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without
supply of food, or present sustenance till they could rovide
for it : that, it was true, I had this disadvantage and iscom-
fort, that I was alone ; but then the supply I had providentially
thrown into my hands, by the unex ected driving of the ship
on shore, was such a help as would ave encouraged any crea-
ture in the world to have applied himself as I had done.
"Seignior," says the Spaniard, "had we poor Spaniards been
in your case, we should never have got half those things out
of the ship, as you did : nay," says he, " we should never have
found means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have got
the raft on shdre without heat or sail ; and how much less
should we have done if any of us had been alone l " Well, I
desired him to abate his compliments, and go on with the his-
tory of their coming on shore, where they landed. He told
me they unhappily landed at a place where there were people
without provisions : whereas, had they had the common sense
to put 05 to sea again, and gone to another island a little
farther, they had found prov1sions, though without people;
there being an island that way, as they had been told, where
there were provisions, though no people ; that is to say, that
the Spaniar s of Trinidad had frequently been there, and had
filled the island with goats and hogs at several times, where
they had bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and sea-
fowls were in such plenty, that they could have been in no
want of flesh, though they had found no bread ; whereas, here,
they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which
the understood not, and which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough ; and they
could treat them no better, unless they would turn cannibals, and
eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty of their country.

They ave me an account how many ways the strove to
civilize fiie savages they were with, and to teac them ra-
tional customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain ; and
how they retorted it upon them, as unjust, that they, who came
there for assistance and support, should attempt to set up for
instructors of those that ave them food ; intimating, it seems,
that none should set up or the instructors of others but those
who could live without them.

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were
driven to ; how sometimes they were many days without any
food at all, the island the were u on being inhabited by a
sort of savages, that live more in olent, and for that reason
were less su plied with the necessaries of life than they had
reason to be ieve others were in the same part of the world:
and yet they found that these savages were less ravenous and
voracious than those who had better supplies of food. Also
they added, they could not but see with what demonstrations
of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of God
directs the events of things in this world : which, they said,
appeared in their circumstances ; for if, pressed by the hard-
ships they were under, and the barrenness of the countr where
they were, they had searched after a better to live in, t ey had
then been out of the way of the relief that happened to them
by my means. '

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they
lived among expected them to 0 out with them into their
wars : and, it was true, that as t ey had firearms with V them,
had they not had the disaster to lose their ammunition, they
could _have been serviceable not only to their friends, but
have made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies ;
but being without powder and shot, and yet in a condition
that they could not in reason deny to go out with their land-
lords to their wars ; so when they came into the field of
battle, they were in a worse condition than the savages them-
selves, for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they
use those the savages gave them ; so they could do nothing
but stand still and be wounded with arrows, till they came
up to the teeth of their enemy ; and then, indeed, the three
halberts they had were of use to them; and the would
often drive a whole little army before them with t ose hal-
berts, and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their mus-
kets: but that, for all this, the were sometimes surrounded
with multitudes, and in great anger from their arrows, till
at last they found the way to make themselves large targets
of wood, which they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose
names they knew not, and these covered them from the arrows
of the savages : that, notwithstandin these, they were some-
times in great danger; and five of t em were once knocked
down together with the clubs of the savages, which was the
time when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the
Spaniard whom I relieved : that at first they thought he had
been killed; but when they afterwards heard he was .taken
prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and
lwould willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued
1111.

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the
rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them
fighting till they were come to themselves, all but ,him who
they thought had been dead ; and then they made their way
wit their halberts and pieces, standing close together in a
line, through a body of above a thousand savages, beating
down all that came in their way, got the victory over their
enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it was with the
loss of their friend, whom the other party, findin alive,
carried ofi, with some others, as I gave an account be ore.

They described, most afiectionately, how they were sur-
prised with joy at the return of their friend and companion
in misery, who they thought had been devoured by wild
beasts of the worst kind--wild men; and yet, how more and
more the were surprised with the account he gave them of
his erran , and that there was a Christian in any place near,
much more one that was able, and had humanity enough, to
contribute to their deliverance.

The described how they were astonished at the sight of
the re ief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of
bread--things they had not seen since their coming 'to that
miserable place; how often the crossed it and blessed it as
bread sent from heaven ; and w rat a reviving cordial it was
to their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent
for their supply; and, after all, they would have told me
something 0 the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and
pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from
whence all these new comforts came: but it was im ossible
to ex ress it by words ; for their excessive joy natural y driv-
ing t em to unbecoming extravaglanees, they had no way to
describe them, but by telling me t ey bordered upon lunacy,
having no way to give vent to their passions suitable to the
sense that was u on them ; that in some it worked one way
and in some anot er ; and that some of them through a sur-
prise of joy would burst into tears, others be stark mad, and
others immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected
me, and called to my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his
father, and the cor people's ectasy when I took them up at
sea after their s ip was on fire; the joy of the mate of the
ship when he found himself delivered in the place where he
expected to perish; and my own joy, when, after twenty-
eight years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry me
to my own country. All these things made me more sensible
of the relation of these poor men, and more affected with
it.

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found
them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these people,
and the condition in which I left them. It was their opinion,
and mine too, that they would be troubled no more With the
savages, or if they were, they would be able to cut them ofi,
if they were twice as many as before ; so they had no concern
about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the
S aniard, whom I call governor, about their stay in the
is and ; for as I was not come to carry any of them OE, so it
would not be just to carry off some and leave others, who,
perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength was dim-
inished. 0n the other hand, I told them I came to establish
them there, not to remove them ; and then I let them know
that I had brought with me relief of sundry kind for them;
that I had been at a great charge to supply them with all things
necessary, as well for their convenience as their defense ; and
that I had such and such particular persons with me, as well
to increase and recruit their number, as by the particular
necessary employments which they were bred to, being arti-
ficers, to assist them in those things in which at present they
were in want.

They were all together when I talked thus to them: and
before I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked
them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried their
first animosities that had been among them, and would shake
hands with one another, and engage in a strict friendship and
union of interest, that so there might be no more misunder-
standings and jealousies.

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and ood humor,
said they had met with affliction enough to ma e them all
sober, and enemies enough to make them all friends; that,
for his part, he would live and die with them, and was so far
from designing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned
they had done nothing to him but what his own mad humor
made necessary, and what he would have done, and perhaps
worse, in their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if
I desired it, for the foolish and brutish thin he had done to
them, and was very willing and desirous of iving in terms of
entire friendship and union with them, and would do an thing
that lay in his power to convince them of it ; and as or go-
ing to England, he cared not if he did not go thither these
twenty years.

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill-
conduct, as they had let me know, and they appealed to me
for the necessity they were under to do so ; ut that Will
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they
had with the savages, and on several occasions since, and had
showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the general
interest of them all, that they had forgotten all that was
passed, and thou ht he merited as much to be trusted with
arms and supplie with necessaries as any of them ; and they
had testified their satisfaction in him by committing the com-
mand to him next to the governor himself ; and as they had
entire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they ac-
knowledged they had merited that confidence by all the
methods that honest men could merit to be valued and
trusted; and they most heartily embraced the occasion of
giving me this assurance, that they would never have any
interest so arate from one another.

Upon t ese frank and open declarations of friendship, we
appointed the next day to dine all to ether ; and, indeed, we
made 'a splendid feast. I caused the s ip's cook and his mate
to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's
mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six
pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's
provisions, with our unch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and,
in particular,I gave t iem ten bottles of French claret, and ten
bottles of English beer; things that neither the Spaniards nor
the English had tasted for many years, and which it may be
supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to
our feast five whole kids, which the cooks roasted ; and three
of them were sent, covered up close, on board the shi to the
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on s ore, as
we did with their salt meat from on board.

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I
brought my cargo of goods ; wherein, that there might be no
dispute about dividing, I showed them that there was a
sufficiency for them all, desiring that they might all take an
equal quantity of the goods that were for wearm ; that is to
say, equal when made up. As, first, I distribute linen suffi-
cient to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the Span-
iard's request, afterwards made them up six; these were ex-
ceeding comfortable to them, having been what they had lon
since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them. I allotte.
the thin English stufis, which I mentioned before, to make
every one a light coat, like a frock, which I judged fittest for
the heat of the season, cool and loose; and ordered that when-
ever they decayed, they should make more, as they thought
fit; the like for pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc.

I cannot express what leasure, what satisfaction, sat upon
the countenances of all t lese poor men, when they saw the
care I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them.
They told me I was a father to them ; and that having such a
correspondent as I was in so remote a part of the world, it
would make them forget that the were left in a desolate place ;
and they all voluntarily engage to me not to leave the place
without my consent.

Then I resented to them the people I had brought with me,
particular y the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all
of them most necessary people; but, above all, my general
artificer, than whom they could not name anything that was
more useful to them ; and the tailor, to show his concern for
them, went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made them
every one a shirt, the first thing he did ; and, what was still
more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch,
and use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts
for their husbands, and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters,I scarce need mention how useful they
were ; for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy thinas,
and made clever convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards,
lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind.
But to let them see how Nature made artificers at first, I
carried the car enters to see Will Atkins' basket-house, as I
called it ; and t ey both owned they never saw an instance of
such natural ingenuity before, nor anything so regular and so
handily built, at least of its kind; and one of them, when he
saw it, after musing a good while, turning about to me, " I am
sure," sa s he," that man has no need of us; you need do
nothing at give him tools."

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave
every man a digging-s ade, ashovel, and a rake, for we had no
harrows or plow: an to ever separate place a pickaxe, a
crow, a broad ax, and a saw; a ways appointin , that as often
as any were broken or worn out, they shoul be sup lied,
without grudging, out of the general stores that I left he ind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all
sorts of iron-work, they had without reserve, as they required ;
for no man would take more than he wanted, and he must be
a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account what-
ever ; and for the use of the smith I left two tons of unwrought
iron for a supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them
was such, even to rofusion, that they could not but rejoice at
them ; for now t ey could march as I used to do, With a
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and were
able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little
advanta es of situation, which also they could not miss, if
they ha occasion.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother
was starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober, well
educated, religious young woman, and behaved so inolfensively
that every one gave her a good word; she had, indeed, an un-
happy life with us, there being no woman in the ship but her-
self, but she bore it with patience. After a wlule, seeing
things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon
my island, and considerin that they had neither business nor
acquaintance in the East ndies, or reason for taking so long
a voyage, both of them came to me, and desired I would give
them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among my
family as the called it. I agreed to this readily; and they
had a little p ot of ground allotted to them, where they had
three'tents or houses set u , surrounded with a basket-work,
pallisadoed like Atkins', a joining to his plantation. Their
tents were contrived so that they had each of them a room
apart to lodge in, and a middle tent like a great storehouse, to
la their oods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the
ot er two nglishmen removed their habitation to the same
place ; and so the island was divided into three colonies, and
no more--viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday and the first
servants, at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in a
word, the capital city, and where they had so enlarged and
extended their works, as well under as on the outside of the
hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at
large. Never was there such a little city in a wood, and so
hid, in any part of the world; for I verily believe that a
thousand men might have ranged the island for a month, and,
if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the trees
stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast woven one into
another, that nothing but cutting them down first could dis-
cover the place, except the only two narrow entrances where
they went in and out could be found, which was not very easy;
one of them was close down at the water's ed e, on t e side
of the creek, and it was afterwards above two undred ards
to the place: and the other was up a ladder at twice, as have
already described it : and they had also a large wood, thickly
planted, on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, whic
grew apace, and concealed the place from all discovery there,
with only one narrow place between two trees, not easily to
be discovered, to enter on that side.

The other colon was that of Will Atkins, where there were
four families of nglishmen, I mean those I had left there,
with their wives and children ; three savages that were slaves,
the widow and the children of the Englishman that was killed,
the young man and the maid, and, by the way, we made a
wife of her before we went away. There were also the two
carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me for them;
also the smith, who was a very necessary man to them, especi-
ally as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms ; and my other
man, whom I call Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as
good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very in-
genious fellow, but a very merry fellow, and before I went
away we married him to the honest maid that came with the
youth in the ship I mentioned before.

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me natural] to sa
somethin of the French ecclesrastic that I had broug t wit
me out o the ship's crew whom I took up at sea. It is true
this man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give oflense to
some hereafter if I leave anything extraordinary upon record
of a man whom, before I begin, I must (to set him out in just
colors) represent in terms very much to his disadvantage, in
the account of Protestants; as, first, that he was a Papist;
secondly a Popish riest; and thirdly, a French Popish priest.
But justice deman s of me to give lum a due character ; and
I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious
person; exact in his life, extensiye in his charity, and exem-
plary in almost everything he did. What then, can anyone
say against being very sensible of the value of such a man,
notwithstandin his rofession ? though it may be my opinion,
perhaps, as wel as t 1e opinion of at ers who shall read this,
that he was mistaken.

The first hour that I began to converse with him, after he
had a reed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason
to delight exceedingly in his conversation ; and he first be an
with me about religion in the most obligin g manner imagina le.
" Sir," says he, " you have not only un er God" (and at that he
crossed his breast) " saved my life, but you have admitted me
to go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging civility,
have taken me into our family, givin me an opportunity of
free conversation. ow, sir, you see y my ha it what my
profession is, and I guess by yournation what yours is ; I may
think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost
endeavors, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can to the
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic doctrine ;
but as I am here under your permission, and in your family,
I am bound in justice to your kindness, as well as in decency
and ood manners, to be under your government; and there-
foreI shall not, without your leave, enter into an debate on
the points of religion in which we may not agree, arther than
you shall give me leave."

I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but
acknowledge it; that it was true we were such people as
they called heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic
I had conversed with, without falling into inconveniences, or
carrying the questions to any height in debate; that he
should not find himself the worse used for being of a dif-
ferent opinion from us, and if we did not converse without
anyldishke on either side, it should be his fault, not ours.

e replied that he thought all our conversation might be
easily separated from disputes; that it was not his business
to ca principles with every man he conversed with; and
that ' is rather desired me to converse with him as a gentle-
man than as a religionist; and that, if I would give him leave
at any time to discourse upon religious subjects, he would
readily comply with it, and that he did not doubt but I
would allow him also to defend his own opinions as well as
he could ; but that, without my leave, he would not break in
upon me with any such thing. He told me, farther, that he
would not cease to do all that became him, in his ofiice as a
priest, as well as a private Christian, to procure the good of
the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and though,
perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not pray
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he woul do
upon all occasions. In this manner we conversed ; and as he
was of the most obliging, gentlemanlike behavior, so he was,
if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I
believe, of great learning.

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the
man extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which
had hefallen him in the few years that be ad been abroad in
the world; and particularly it was ver remarkable, that in
the voyage he was now engaged in, he ad the misfortune to
be five times shipped and unshipped, and never to o to the

lace whither any of the ships he was in at first esigned.

hat his first intent was to have one to Martinico, and that
he went on board a ship boun thither at St. Malo ; but,
being forced into Lisbon by bad weather. the ship received
some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river
'l'agus, and was obli ed to unload her cargo there; but find-
ing a Portuguese s ip there bound to the Madeiras, and
ready to sail, and an posing he should easily meet with a ves-
sel there bound to glartimco, he went on board, in order to
sail to the Madciras; but the master of the Form uese ship,
being but an indiiferent mariner, had been out of iis reckon-
ing, and they drove to Fyal; where, however, he happened
to find a very good market for his cargo, which was corn, and
therefore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt
at the Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland. He
had no remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship, and
had a pretty good voyage as far as the banks (so they call
the place where the catch the fish), where, meeting with a
French ship bound rom France to Quebec, in the river of
Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions,
he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his
first design ; but when he came to Quebec, the master of the
ship died, and the vessel proceeded no farther; so the next
voyage be shipped himself for France, in the ship that was
burned when we took them up at sea, and then shipped with,
us for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had
been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one
vpyage, besides what I shall have occasion to mention farther
0 him. _

But I shall not make digression into other men's stories,
which have no relation to my own ; I return to what concerns
our afiairs in the island. He came to me one morning (for he
lodged among us all the while we were upon the wand), and
it happened to be just when I was going to visit the English-
men's colony, at the farthest part of the island ; I say he
came to me, and told me with a very grave countenance, that
he had for two or three days desired an opportunit of some
discourse with me, which he hoped would not be disp casing to
me because he thought it mi ht in some measure correspond
with my general design, whic was, the prosperity of my new
colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than e yet
thought it was, in the way of God's blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last art of his discourse,
and tnrninga little short, " How, sir," said , " can it be said that
we are not in the way of God's blessing, after such visible
assistances and deliverances as we have seen here, and of which
I have given you a large account?" "If you had pleased,
sir," said he, with a world of modesty, and yet great readiness,
"to have heard me, you would have found no room to have been
displeased, much less to think so hard of me, that I should
suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and de-
liverances; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the
wa of God's blessing, and your design is exceeding good,
an will prosper: but, sir, t ough it were more so than is
even possible to you, yet there may be some among you that
are not equall ri ht in their actions 2 and you know, that in
the story of t e c ildren of Israel, one Achan in the cam re-
moved God's blessing from them, and turned his han so
against them, that six-and-thirty of them, though not con-
cerned in the crime, were the objects of Divine vengeance,
and bore the weight of that punishment."

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his
inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere,
and was really so religious in its own nature, that I was very
sorry I had interru ted him, and begged him to go on ; and,
in the mean time, ecause it seemed that what we had both
to sa might take up some time, I told him I was going to
the nglishmen's plantations, and asked him to go with me,
and 'we might discourse of it by the way. He told me he
would the more willingly wait on me thither, because there
partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me
about; so we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and
plain with me in what he had to say.

"Why, then, sir," says he, " be pleased to give me leave to
lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have
to say, that we may not differ in the general principles,
though we may be of some differing opinions in the practice
of particulars. First, sir, though we difier in some of the
doctrinal articles of religion (and it is very unhapfpy it is so,
especially in the case before us, as I shall show a terwards),
yet there are some general principles in which we both
agree--that there is a God; and that this God having given
us some stated general rules for our service and obedience, we
ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either by
ne lecting to do what he has commanded, or by doing what
heias expressly forbidden. And let our difl'erent religions be
what they will, this general principle is readily owned by us
all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow pre-
sumptuous sinning against his command ; and every good
Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that
are under his care living in a total ne lect of God and his
commands. It is not your men being rotestauts, whatever
my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from being
concerned for their souls, and from endeavoring, if it lies be-
fore me, that they should live in as little distance from en-
mity with their Maker as possible, especially if you give me
leave to meddle so far in your circuit. '

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I
granted all he had said and thanked him that he would so far
concern himself for us, and begged he would explain the par-
ticulars of what he had observed, that like Joshua, to take
his own parable, I might ut away the acoursed thing from us.

" Wh , then, sir," says e, "I will take the liberty you give
me; an there are three things, which, if I am right, must
stand in the way of God's blessing upon your endeavors here,
and which I should rejoice, for your sake and their own, to see
removed. And, sir, I promise myself that you will full agree
with me in them all, as soon as I name them ; especia 1y, be-
cause I shall oonvince you, that every one of them may, with

reat ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be remedied.

irst, sir," says he, " you have here four Englishmen, who have
fetched women from among the savages, and have taken them
as their wives, and have had many children b them all, and
yet are not married to them after any stated lega manner, as the
awe of God and man require ; and therefore are yet, in the sense
of both, no less than fornicators, if not living in adultery. To
this, sir, I know you will object that there was no clergyman
or priest of any kind, or any profession, to perform the cere-
mony ; nor any en and ink, or paper, to write down a contract
of marriage, an have it signe between them. And I know
also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you, I mean
of the agreement that he obliged them to make when they took
those women, viz., that they should choose them out by con-
sent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way, is
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women as Wives,
but only an a reement among themselves to keep them from
quarrehng. ut, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri-
mony [so he called it, being a Roman] consists not only in the
mutal consent of the arties to take one another as man and
wife, but in the forma and legal obligation that there is in the
contract, to compel the man and woman, at all times, to own
and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to abstain
from all other women, to engage in no other contract while
these subsist ; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to pro-
vide honestlfi for them and their children ; and to obli e the
women to t e same or like conditions, mutatis mutar is, on
their side. Now, sir," says be, "these men may, when they
please, or when occasion resents, abandon these women, dis-
own their children, leave t em to perish, and take other women,
and marry them while these are livin ;" and here he added,
with some warmth, <<6 How, sir, is Godi nored in this unlawful
libert ? And how shall a blessin succeed your endeavors in
this p ace, however ood in themsgves, and however sincere in
your design, while t ese men, who at present are your subjects,
under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by
you to live in open a ultery?"

I confess I was struck With the thing itself, but much more
with the convincing arguments he supported it with ; for it was
certainly true that, though they had no cler an upon the
spot, yet a formal contract on both sides, made efore Witnesses,
and confirmed b any token which they had all agreed to be
bound by, thong it had been but breaking a stick between
them, engaging the men to own these women for their wives
upon all occasions, and never to abandon them or their children,
and the women to the same with their husbands, had been an
effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God; and it was a
great neglect that it was not done. But I thought to have got
01f my young priest by tellin him that all that part was done
when I was not there ; and tSSat they had lived so many years
with them now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy;
nothing could be done in it now.

" Sir," says he, " asking your pardon for such freedom, you
are right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could
not be charged with that part of the crime ; but, I beseech you,
flatter not yourself that you are not, therefore, under an obliga-
tion to do our utmost now to ut an end to it. How can you
think but t at, let the time past ie on whom it will, all the guilt

_,__' .. __-.
for the future will lie entirely upon you '1' because it is certainly
in your power now to put an end to it, and in nobody's power
but yours."

I was so dull still that I did not understand him right ; but
I ima ined that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I should
part t em, and not sufier them to live together any longer;
and I said to him I could not do that by any means, for that
would ut the whole island into confusion. He seemed sur-
prised t at I should so far mistake him. " No, sir," says he,
" I do not mean that you should now separate them, but legally
and efiectually marry them ; and as, 811', my way of marrying
them may not be easy to reconcile them to, though it will be
efiectua], even by your own laws, so your way may be as well
before God, and as valid among men. I mean by a written
contract, signed by both man and woman, and by all the wit-
nesses resent, which all the laws of Europe would decree to
be vali ."

Iwas amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity
of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to
his own arty or church, and such true warmth for preserving
the peep e, that he had no knowledge of or relation to ; I say,
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of God, the
like of which had, indeed, not met with anywhere. But recol-
lecting what he had said of marryin them by a written contract,
which I knew he would stand to, returned it back upon him,
and told him I granted all that he had said to be just, and on
his part very kind ; that I would discourse with the men upon
the point now, when I came to them ; and I knew no reason
why they should scru 1e to let him marry them all, which I
knew well enou h wou dbe granted to be as authentic and valid
in England as i they were married by one of our own clergy-
men. What was afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak
of by itself. '

I then ressed him to tell me what was the second complaint
which he ad to make, acknowled ing that I was very much his
debtor for the first, and thanked im heartily for it. He told
me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the second,
and hoped I would take it as well ; and this was, that notwith-
standing these English subjects of mine, as he called them, had
lived wrth these women almost seven years, had taught them
to speak English and even to read it, and that they were, as
he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and capable
of instruction, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them any-
thing of the Christian religion--no, not so much as to know
that ,there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner God
was to be served, or that their own idolatry, and worshiping
they knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said,
was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly
call them to account for, and perhaps at last take the work out
of their hands. He spoke this very afiectionatel and warmly.
" I am persuaded," says he, "had those men live in the savage
country whence their wives came, the savages would have taken
more pains to have brought them to be idolators, and to wor-
ship t e devil, than any of these men, so far as I can see, have
taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true God.
Now, sir," said he, " though I do not acknowledge your religion,
or you mine, yet we would be glad to see the devil's servants,
and the subjects of his kingdom, tau ht to know the general

rinciples of the Christian religion ; t at they might, at least,
iiear of God and a Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of
a future state--things which we all believe ; that they might,
at least, be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true
church than they are now, in the public profession of idolatry
and devil--worship."

I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms, and em-
braced him with an excess of assion. "How far," said I to
him, "have I been from un erstanding the most essential
part of a Christian, viz., to love the interest of the Christian
church, and the good of other men's souls ! I scarce have
known what belon s to the being a Christian." " Oh, sir! do
not say so," replie he; " this thing is not your fault." "No,"
said I z " but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you? "
" It is not too late et," said he ; "be not too forward to con-
demn yourself." " ut what can be done now?" said I ; " you
see I am going away." " Will ou give me leave to talk with
these poor men about it ? " " es, with all my heart," said I;
." and will oblige them to give heed to what you say too." " As
to that," said he, -" we must leave them to the mercy of Christ ;
but it is your business to assist them, encourage them, and
instruct theln ; and if ou give me leave, and God his blessing,
I do not doubt but t 1e oor ignorant souls shall be brought
home to the great circleo Christianity, if not into the particu-
lar faith we all embrace, and that even while you stay here."
Upon this, I said, " I shall not only give you leave, but give you
a thousand thanks for it." What followedI shall mention in
its place.

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to
blame. " Why, really," says he, "it is of the same nature.
And I will proceed, asking your leave, with the same plainness
as before. It is about your poor savages, who are, as I may
say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or
ought to be, received among all Christians, of what church or
pretended church soever, that the Christain knowledge ought
to be propagated by all possible means, and on all possible oc-
casions. It is on this principle that our church sends mission-
aries into Persia, India, and China ; and that our clergy, even
of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous
voyages, and the most dangerous residence among murderers
and barbarians, to teach them the knowled e of the true God,
and to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now,
sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and
thirty poor savages brought over from a state of idolatry to
the nowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I
wonder how you can pass such an occasion of doing good which
is really worth the expense of a man's whole life.'

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say.
I had here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion
before me, let his particular principles be of what kind sover.
As for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this
inm heart before, and I believe I should not have thought of it;
for looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had
we not had any work for them to do, we would lave used as such
or would have been glad to have transported them to any other
part of the world; for our business waste get rid of them, and
we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any
country, so they had never seen their own. I was confounded
at his discourse, and knew not what answer to make him.

He looked earnestly at me seeiu me in some disorder--" Sir,"
as s be, " I shall be very sorr if w at I have said ives you any
0 ense." " No, no," said Ly "I am offended wit nobody but
myself ; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that
Ishould never take any notice of this before, but with reflectin
what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," sai
I, " what circumstances I mil in ; I am bound to the East Ind-
ies in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be
an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the
men lying all this while at victuals and wages on the owners'
account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here,
and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diem
demurrage ; nor can I stay upon demurrage above ei ht days
more, and Ihave been here thirteen alread ; so that am per-
fectly unable to engage in this work,unless would suffer myself
to be left behind here again ; in which case, if this single vship
should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in
the same condition that I was left in here at first, and from
which I have been so wonderfully delivered." He owned the
case was very hard upon me as to my voyage ; but laid it home
upon my conscience, whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven
souls was not worth venturing all I had in the world for. I
was not so sensible of that as he was. I replied to him thus :
"Why sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an instrument
in God's hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the know-
ledge of Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given
over to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall into the way of
your profession ; how is it, then, that you do not rather ofler
yourself to undertake it than press me to do it?"

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along,
and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low how. "I
most heartily thank God and on, sir," said he, " for giving me
so evident a call to so blesse a work ; and if ou think your-
self discharged from it, and desire me to underta e it, I will most
readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards
and difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I
haw]: ,met with, that I am dropped at last into so glorious a
war . -

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this
to me : his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his
color came and went, as if he had been fallin into fits; in a
word, he was fired with the joy of being em arked in such
a work. I paused a considerable while before I could tell
what to say to him ; for I was really surprised to find a man
of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond
the ordinal rate of men, not of his profession only, but even
of any pro ession whatsoever. But after I had considered it
awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that
he would venture, on the single consideration of an attempt
to convert those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted
island for, perhaps, his life, and at last might not know
whether he should be able to do them good or not.

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a
venture. "Pray sir," said he, "what do you think I con-
sented to go in your ship to the East Indies for?" "Nay,"
said I, " that I know not, unless it was to preach to the Ind-
ians." "Doubtless it was," said he; "and do you think, if I
can convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ,
it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched off
the island again ?--nay, is it not infinitel of more worth to
save so many souls than my life is, or the ife of twenty more
of the same profession? Yes, sir," says he, "I would ive
Christ and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days if I can! be
made the haplpy instrument of saving the souls of those poor
men, though were never to get my foot off this island, or see
my native country an more. But since on will honor me
with putting me into t is work, for which will pray for you
all the days of my life, I have one humble petition to you be-
sides." " What is that?" said I. " Why," says he, " it is,
that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my inter~
preter to them, and to assist me ; for without some help I
cannot speak to them, or they to me."

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I
could not think of parting with him, and that for many
reasons : he had been the companion of my travels ; he was not
on] faithful to me, but sincerely aflectionate to the last degree;
an I had resolved to do something considerable for him if he
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I knew that,
as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite con-
found him to bring him to embrace another religion ; and he
would never, while his eyes were open, believe that his old
master was a heretic, and would be damned ; and this might
in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him
back again to his first idolatry. Iowever, a sudden thought
relieve me in this strait, and it was this : I told him I could
not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever, though a work that to him was of more value than
his life ought to be to me of much more value than the keep-
ing or parting with a servant. But, on the other hand, I was
persua ed that Friday would by no means agree to part with
me; and I could not force him to it without his consent, with-
out manifest injustice ; because I had promised I would never
send him away, and he had promised and engaged to me that
he would never leave me, unless I sent him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one
word of their language, nor they one of his. To remove this
difficult , I told him Friday's father had learned S anish,
which found he also understood, and he should serve 1him as
an interpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing
could persuade him but he would stay and endeavor to convert
tfiem ; but Providence gave another very happy turn to all
t is.

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When
we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and
after some account given them of what I had done for them,
viz., what necessary things I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and
very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous
life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice
the clergyman had taken of it ; and arguin how unchristian
and irreligious a life it was, I first asked t rem if they were
married men or bachelors. They soon explained their con-
dition to me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and
the other three were single men or bachelors. I asked them
with what conscience they could take these women, and call
them their wives, and have so many children by them, and not
be lawfull married to them.

They al gave me the answer I expected, viz., that there was
nobody to marry them ; that they agreed before the governor
to keep them as their wives, an to maintain them and own
them as their wives ; and they thought, as thin s stood with
them, they were as legally married as if they had een married
by a parson, and with all the formalities in the world.

I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of
God, and were bound in conscience to keep them as their
wives ; but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might
desert the poor women and children hereafter; and that their
wives, being poor desolate women, friendless and moneyless,
would have no way to help themselves. I therefore told them
that, unless I was assured of their honest intent, I could do
nothing for them, but would take care that what I did should
be for the women and children without them ; and that, unless
they would give me some assurances that they would marry
the women, could not think it was convenient they should con~
tinue together as man and wife ; for that it was both scandal-
ous to men and ofiensive to God, who they could not think
would bless them if they went on thus.

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, especially
Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they
loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own
native country, and would not leave them on any account
whatever; and they did verily believe that their wives were
as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skill,
as much for them and for their children as any women could
possibly do ; and they would not part with them on any ac-
count; and Will Atkins, for his own particular, added, that
if any man would take him away, and offer to carry him home
to England, and make him captain of the best man-of-war in
the navy, he would not go with him if he might not carry his
wife and children with him: and if there was a clergyman in
the ship, he would be married to her now with all his heart.

This was just as I would have it. The priest was not with
me at that moment, but was not far ofi : so to try him farther,
I told him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere,
I would have him married next morning, and bade him con-
sider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself he
need not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it,
and was glad I had a minister with me, and re believed they
would be all willing also. I then told him that m friend, the
minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak nglish, butI
would act the clerk between them. He never so much as
asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was,
indeed, what I was afraid of ; so we parted : I went back to
my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his com-
panions. I desired the French gentleman not to say an thing
to them till the business was thoroughly ripe ; and I to d him
what answer the men had given me.

Before I went from their quarter they all came to me, and
told me they had been considering what I had said ; that they
were glad to hear I had a cler an in my company, and they
were very willing to give me t e satisfaction I desired, and to
be formally married as soon as I pleased ; for they were far
from desiring to part with their wives, and that they meant
nothin butwhat was very honest when they chose them. So
I appomted them to meet me the next morning ; and, in the
meantime, they should let their wives know the meaning of
the marriage law ,; and that it was not only to prevent any scan-
dal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake them,
whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the
thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had
reason to be; so they failed not to attend altogether at my
apartment next morning, where I brought out my clergyman ;
and. though he had not on a minister's gown, after the manner
of England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of
France, yet having a black vest something like a cassock, with
a sash round it, he did not look very unlike aminister ; and as
for his language, I was his interpreter. But the seriousness of
his behavior to them, and the scruples he made of marrying
the women, because they were not baptized and professed
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his person ;
and there was no need, after that, to inquire whether he was a
clergyman or not. Indeed, I was afraid his scruples would
have been carried so far as that he would not have married
them at all ; nay, notwithstanding all I was able say to him,
he resisted me, though modestly yet very steadily, and at last
refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talked
with the men and the women too ; and though at first I was a
little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will,
perceivinrr the sincerity of his design.

When he came to them, he let them know that I had ac-
quainted him with their circumstances, and with the present
design; that he was very willing to erform that art of his
function, and marry them, as I had esired ; but t at before
he could do it he must take the liberty to talk with them. He
told them that in the sight of all indifierent men, and in the sense
of the laws of society, they had lived all this while in open
fornication; and that it was true that nothing but the con-
senting to marry or effectually separating them from one an-
other, could now put an end to it ; but there was a difficulty
in it too, with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony,
which he was not fully satisfied about, that of marrying one
that is a professed Christian to a savage, an idolator, and a
heathen--one that is not baptized ; and yet that he did not
see that there was time left to endeavor to ersuade the
women to be baptized, or to profess the name of hrist, whom
they had, he doubted, heard nothin of, and without which
they could not be baptized. He to d them he doubted they
were but indifierent Christians themselves ; that they had but
little knowledge of God or his ways and therefore he could
not expect that they had said much to their wives on that head
yet ; but that unless they would promise him to use their en-
deavors with their wives to persuade them to become Christ-
ians, and would, as well as they could, instruct them in the
knowledge and belief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them ;
for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages,
nor was it consistent with the princi les of the Christian re-
ligion, and was, indeed, expressly for idden in God's law.

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I
could, only ~ometimes adding something of my own, to con-
vince them how just it was, and that I was of his mind ; and I
always ver faithfully distinguished between what I said from
myself, an what were the olergyman's words. They told me
it was very true what the gentleman said, that they were very
indifierent Christians themselves, and that they had never
talked to their wives about religion. " Lord, sir," sa s Will
Atkins, " how should we teach them religion '? hy, we
know nothing ourselves 3 and besides, sir," said he, " should we
talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it
would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe our-
selves. And if we should tell them that we believe all the
things we speak of to them, such as of good people going to
heaven, and wicked people to the devi , they would ask us
where we intend to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are
such wicked fellows as we indeed are. Why, sir, 'tis enough
to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing ; folks must
have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach
other people." " Will Atkins," said I to im, "though I am
afraid that what you say has too much truth in it, yet can on
not tell your wife she is in the wrong; that there is a 0d,
and a religion better than her own ; that her gods are idols ;
that they can neither hear nor 3 eak; that t ere is a great
Being that made all things, and t at can destroy all that he
has made ; that he rewards the good and unishes the bad ;
and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we do
here? You are not so ignorant, but even Nature itself will
teach you that all this is true ; and I am satisfied you know it
all to be true, and believe it yourself." "That is true, sir,"
said Atkins ; " but with what face can I say anything to my
wife of all this, when she will tell me immediately it cannot
be true ?" "Not true ! " said I ; " what do you mean by
that ? " " Wh , sir," said he, " she will tell me it cannot be
true that this (god I shall tell her of can be just, or can pun-
ish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil,
that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I have
been, even to her, and to everybody else ; and that I should
be suffered to live, that have been always acting so contrary
to what I must tell her is cod, and to what I ought to have
done." " Why, truly, At ins," said I, " I am afraid thou
speakest too much truth ;" and with that I informed the clergy-
man of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know.
" Oh," said the priest, " tell him there is one thing will make
him the best minister in the world to his wife, and that is, re-
pentance ; for none teach repentance like true penitents. He
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the
better qualified to instruct his wife ; he will then be able to
tell her there is not only a God, and that he is the just rewarder
of good and evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and, with in-
finite goodness and long-sufiering, forbears to punish those
that ofl'end ; waitin to be gracious, and willing not the death
of a sinner, but ratier that he should return and live; that
oftentimes he suffers wicked men to go a long time, and even
reserves damnation to the general day of retribution ; that it
is a clear evidence of God and of a future state, that righteous
men receive not their reward, or wicked men their punish-
ment, till the come into another world ; and this will lead
him to teach is wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of
the last judgment. Let him but re ent himself, he will be an
excellent preacher of repentance to is wife."

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the
while, and who, we could easily preceive, was more than or-
dinarily afiected with it; when being eager, and hardly suf-
fering me to make an end--" I know all this, master," says he,
" and a great deal more ; but I have not the impudence to talk
thus to my wife, when God and my conscience know, and my
wife will be an undeniable evidence against me, that I have
lived as if I had never heard of a God or future state, or any-
thing about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas [and with
that he fetched a deep sigh, and I coul see that the tears stood
in his eyes] 'tis past all that with me." "Past it, Atkins '1'"
said I : " what dost thou mean by that 7" " I know well enough
what'I mean," says he 3 " I mean 'tis too late, and that is too
true.

I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said : the
poor, zealous priest--I must call him so, for, be his 0 inion
what it will, he had certainly a most singular afiection or the
good of other men's souls, and it would be hard to think he had
not the like for his own--I say, this afiectionate man could
not refrain from tears; but, recovering himself, said to me,
"Ask him but one question. Is he easy that it is too late ; or
is he troubled, and wishes it were not so '1' " I put the ques-
tion fairly to Atkins ; and he answered, with a great deal of
passion, " How could an man be easy in a condition that must
certainly end in eternal cstruction ? that he was far from be'
ing easy ; but that, on the contrary, he believed 'it would one
time or other ruin him." " What do you mean by that?"
said I. " Why," he said, "he believed he should one time or
other out his throat, to put an end to the terror of it."

The cler man shook his head, with great concern in his
face, when told him all this ; but turning quick to me upon
it, says. " If that be his case, we may assure him it is not too
late; Christ will give him repentance. But pray," sa 3 he,
" explain this.to him ; that as no man is saved but by 'hrist,
and the merit of his passion procuring Divine mercy for him,
how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy ? Does
he think he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of Divine
mercy ? Pray tell him there may be a time when provoked
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear,
but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy; and we,
that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at.
all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sin-
cerely repent: so that it is never too late to repent."

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnest-

ness ; but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the
rest, for he said to me, he would go and have some talk with his
wife ; so he went out awhile, and we talked to the rest. I
.erceived they were all stupidl ignorant as to matters of re-
ligion, as much as I was when wentrambling away from my
father; and yet there were none of them backward to hear
what had been said : and all of them seriously promised that
they would talk with their wives about it, and do their endea-
vors to persuade them to turn, Christians.

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what an-
swer they gave, but said nothing a good while ; but at last,
shaking his head, " We that are Christ's servants," says he,
" can go no farther than to exhort and instruct; and when
men comply, submit to the reproof, and promise what we ask,
'tis all we can do ; we are bound to accept their good words ;
but believe me, sir," said he, " whatever you ma have known
of the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I be ieve he is the
only sincere convert among them: I will not despair of the
rest ; but that man is apparently struck with the sense of his
past life, and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion
to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it : for attempt-
iu to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching our-
se ves. I know a man who, having nothing but a summary
notion of religion himself, and being wicked and profligate to
the last degree in his life, made a thorough reformation in him-
self by laborin to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins
but once to tal seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, my life
for it he talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself
a enitent ; and who knows what may follow ?"

pon this discourse, however, and their promisin , as above,
to endeavor to persuade their wives to embrace C ristianity,
he married the other two couple ; but Will Atkins and his
wife were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman, wait-
ing awhile, was curious to know where Atkins was gone ; and
turning to me, said, "I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of
your labyrinth here, and look; I darcsay we shall find this
poor man somewhere or other talking seriously to his wife
and teaching her already something of religion." I began to
be of the same mind ; so we went out together, and I carried
him a way which none knew but myself, and where the trees
were so very thick that it was not easy to see through the
thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out;'gga aha--"mam. u mmvaw mu anotn uxv cows 2A,,
when, comin to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his
tawny wife Sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in
discourse ; I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me,
and then, having shown him where they were, we stood and
looked very stea ily at them a good while. We observed him
very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun, and to every
quarter of the heavens, and then down to the earth, then out
to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the
trees. " Now," says the clergyman, " you see my words are
made good, the man preaches to her; mark him now, he is
telling her that our God has made him and her, and the heavens,
the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, etc." " I believe he
is," said I. Immediately, we perceived Will Atkins start upon
his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift u both his hands.
We supposed he said something, but we con d not hear him ;
it was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling half
a minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and
talks to her again ; we perceived then the woman very at-
tentive, but whether she said anything to him we could not
tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees I could see
the tears run lentifully down my clergyman's cheeks, and I
could hardly grbear myself : but it was a great afiliction to
us both that we were not near enough to hear anything that
passed between them. Well, however, we could come no
nearer for fear of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an
end of this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud
enough to us without the help of voice. He sat down again,
as I have said, close by her, and talked again earnest] to her,
and two or three times we could see him embrace er most
passionately ; another time we saw him take out his handker-
chief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind
of transport very unusual ; and after several of these things,
we saw im on a sudden jump 11 a ain, and lend her his hand
to help her up, when immediate y eading her by the hand
a step or two, they both kneeled down together, and con-
tinued so about two minutes.

My friend could bear it no longer. but cries out aloud, " St.
Paul ! St. Paul ! behold, he prayeth l" I was afraid Atkins
would hear him, therefore I entreated him to withhold him-
self awhile, that we might see an end of the scene, which to
me, I must confess, was the most affecting that ever I saw in
my life. Well, he strove with himself for awhile, but was in
such raptures, to think that the poor heathen woman was be-
come a Christian, that he was not able to contain himself ; hc
wept several times, then throwing up his hands and crossing
his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and by the way
of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimon of the suc-
cess of our endeavors ; some he spoke softl ', an I could not
well hear others; some in Latin, some in lsrench; then two
or three times the tears would interrupt him, that he could
not speak at all ; but I begged that he would contain himself,
and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was before
us, which he did for a time, the scene not being near ended
yet ; for after the poor man and his wife were risen a ain from
their knees, we observed he stood talking still eager y to her,
and we observed by her motion that she was greatly afiected
with what he said, by her frequent] lifting up her hands,
laying her hand to her breast, and such other postures as ex-
press the great seriousness and attention ; this continued about
alf a quarter of an hour ; and then they walked away so we
could see no more of them in that situation. I took this in-
terval to say to the clergyman, first, that I was glad to see
the particulars we had both been witnesses to ; that, though
I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began
to think that it was all very sincere here, both in the man and
his wife, however ignorant they might both be, and I ho ed
such a beginning would yet have a more happy end : "Xnd
who knows," said I, "but these two may in time, by instruc-
tion and exam 1e, work upon some of the others?" " Some of
them?" said e, turnimr quick upon me; "ay, upon all of
them ; depend upon it, if. those two savages--for he has been
but little better, as you relate it--should embrace Jesus
Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all the rest;
for true religion is naturally communicative, and he that is
once made a Christian will never leave a Pagan behind him, if
he can help it." I owned it was a most Christian principle to
think so, and a testimony of true zeal, as well as a generous
heart in him. "But, my friend,"-said I, "will you give me
leave to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object
the least thing against that affectionate concern which you
show for the turning of the oor people from their Pagan-
ism to the Christian religion ; ut how does this comfort on,
while these people are, in your account, out of the pale o the
Catholic Chure 1, without which you believe there is no salva-
tion? so that you esteem these but heretics, as eifectually lost
as the Pagans themselves."
To this he answered with abundance of candor, thus : " Sir,
I am a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a priest of the
order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the
Roman faith ; but yet, if you will believe me, and that I do
not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my circum-
stances and your civilities ; I say, nevertheless, I do not look
upon you, who call yourselves reformed, without some charity :
Idare not say (though I know it is our opinion in general)
that you cannot be saved ; I will by no means limit the mercy
of Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you into the
bosom of his church, in a manner to us unperceivable ; and I
hope you have the same charity for us : I pray daily for your
being all restored to Christ's church, by whatsoever method
he, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the meantime,
surely you will allow it consists with me, as a Roman, to dis-
tinguis far between a Protestant and a Pagan ; between one
that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not
think is according to the true faith, and a savage or a bar-
barian, that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer ; and if
you are not within the pale of the Catholic Church, we hope
you are nearer being restored to it than those who know
nothin of God or of his Church: and I rejoice, therefore,
when see this poor man, who, you say, has been a profligate,
and almost a murderer, kneel down and ray to Jesus Christ,
as we su pose he did, though not fully en 'ghtened ; believing
that Go , from whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly
touch his heart, and bring him to the farther knowledge of
that truth in his own time; and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his
wife, I can never believe that he shall be cast away himself.
And have I not reason, then, to rejoice, the nearer any are
brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they may not be
brought quite home into the bosom of the Catholic Church
just at the time when I may desire it, leaving it to the good-
ness of Christ to perfect his work in his own time, and in his
own way? Certain! , I would rejoice if all the savages in
America were broug t, like this poor woman, to pray to God,
thou h they were al to be Protestants at first, rather than they
shou d continue Pa ans or heathens; firmly believing that he
thathad bestowed 51c first light on them would farther illumi-
nate them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and bring them
into the pale of his Church, when he should see good."

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious
Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reason-
ing ; and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if such a
temper was universal, we might be all Catholic Christians,
whatever church or particular profession we joined in; that
a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right
principles ; and as he thought that the like charity would make
us all Catholics, so I told him I believed, had all the members
of his church the like moderation, they would soon all be
Protestants. And there we left that part ; for we never dis-
puted at all. .

However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by
the hand, " My friend," says I, " I wish all the clergy of the
Romish Church were blessed with such moderation, and had
an e ual share of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion ;
but I must tell you, that if you should preac such doctrine in
Spain or Italy, the would at you into the Inquisition." " It
may be so," said e; "I now not what they would do in
S ain or Italy ; but I will not as they would be the better
Christians for that severity; for Iyam sure there is no heresy
in aboundin with charity."

Well, as ill Atkins and his wife were gone, our business
there was over, so we went back our own way; and when we
came back, we found them waiting to be called in ; observing
this, I asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that
we had seen him under the bush or not ; and it was his opin-
ion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, and
hear what he would say to us; so we called him in alone, no-
blody being in the place but ourselves, and I began with him
t ms :

" Will Atkins," said I, " prythee what education had you ?
What was your father?"

W. A.--A better man than' ever I shall be, sir; my father
was a cler man.

R. 0.--%hat education did he give you ?

WI A.--He would have taught me well, sir, but I despised
all education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was.

R. C'.--It is true, Solomon says, " He that despises reproof
is brutish."

W. A.--Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered in
father: for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir;I
murdered my poor father.

1?. 0.----Ha! a murderer!

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word he
spoke) and looked pale : it seems he believed that Will had
really killed his father.

R. 0.--No, no, sir ; I do not understand him so. Will
Atkins, explain yourself ; you did not kill your father, did
you, with your own hands ?

W: A.--No, sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the
thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days ; I broke
his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for the
most tender and affectionate treatment that ever father gave,
or child could receive.

18. 0.--Well, I did not ask you about your father to extort
this confession : I pray God give you re entauce for it, and
forgive that and all your other sins ; but asked you because
I see that though you have not much learning, yet you are not
so ignorant as some are in things that are good ; that you
have known more of religion, a great deal, than you have
practiced.

W A.--Though you, sir, do not extort the confession that
I make about In father, conscience does; and whenever we
come to look bac upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent
parents are certainly the first to touch us ; the wounds they
make lie deepest, and the weight they leave will lie heaviest
upon the mind, of all the sins we can commit.

R. 0.--You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins;
I cannot hear it.

f W. A.--You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothing
0 it.

B. (Si--Yes, Atkins ; every shore, every hill, nay, I may say,
every tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul
for my ingratitude to, and bad usage of, a good tender father;
a father much like yours, by our description : and I murdered
my father as well as you, ill Atkins; butI think, for all
that, my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal.

I would have said more, if I could have restrained my pas-
sions ; but I thought this poor man's repentance was so much
sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse
and retire ; for I was surprised With what he had said, and
thought that instead of my going about to teach and instruct
him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a
most surprising and unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young cler yman, who was greatly
affected with it, and said to me, " 1d I not say, 311', that
when this man was converted he would preach to us all? I
tell you, sir, if this one man be made a true penitent, there will
be no need of me ; he will make Christians of all in the
island."--But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins. " But \Vill," said I, " how comes
the sense of this matterto touch you just now I"

'W. A;--Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck
a dart through my very soul : I have been talking about God
and religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make
a Christian of her, and she has preached such a sermon to me
as I shall never forget _while I live.
R. C'.---No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to you ; but
when you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience
has flung them back u on you.

W. A.--Ay, sir, wit such force as is not to be resisted.

R. CC--Pi'ay, Will, let us know what passed between you
and our wife ; for I know something of it already.

71;: A.--Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of
it; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express
it ; but let her have said what she will, though I cannot give
you an account of it, this I can tell you, that I have resolved
to amend and reform my life.

R. 0.--But tell us some of it; how did you begin, Will?
for this has been an extraordinar case, that is certain. She
has preached a sermon, indeed, ify she has wrought this upon

on.

y 'W. A.--Why I first told her the nature of our laws about
marriage, and what the reasons were that men and women
were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in
the ower of one nor other to break ; that otherwise, order
and Justice could not be maintained, and men would run from
their wives and abandon their children, mix confusedly with
one another, and neither families be kept entire nor inheri-
tances be settled b legal descent.

R. 0.--You tal like a civilian, Will. Could you make
her understand what you meant by inheritance and families ?
They know no such things among the savages, but marry any-
how, without regard to relation, consanguinity, or family;
brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the father
and the daughter, and the son and the mother.

W A.--1 believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it ; perhaps,
for any farther relations, they may not be so exact as we are;
but she tells me never in the. near relationship you s cak of.

.R. a--VVell, what did she say to what you told er?

IVA--She said she liked it very well, as it was much
better than in her country.

.R. 0'.--But did you tell her what marriage was?

W. A.--A , ay, there began all our dialogue. I asked her
if she would he married to me our way. She asked me what
way that was. I told her marriage was ap ointed by God ;
and here we had a strange talk together, in eed, as ever man
and wife had, I believe.

N. B.--This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife I
took down in writing, just after he had told it me, which was
as follows:
er.--Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God
in war country ?

. A.----Yes, my dear, God is in every country.

Wife--No your God in my country ; my country have the
great old Benamuckee God.

W. A.--Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is ;
God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea,
and all that in them is.

Wife--No makee de earth ; no you God makee de earth ;
no makee my country.

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not
makin her countr .

Wz' e.--No.lauglsi'; why laugh me i' This nothing to laugh.

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more
serious than he at first.
(1 W. A.----That's true indeed ; I will not laugh any more, my
ear.

Wife--Why you say you God makee all?

W A.---Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and
you, and me, and all things ; for he is the only true God, and
there is no God but him ; he lives forever in heaven.

Wife--Why you no tell me long a o ?

W.' A.--That's true, indeed ; but have been a wicked
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
anything before, but have live without God in the world
m se .

yWife--What, have you a great God in your country, you
no know him? No say Oh! to him? No do good thing for
him ? That no possible,

W A.--It is true, though, for all that; we live as if there
was no God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

Wife--But why God let you do so? Why he no makee,
youwgood live ? .

. A.--It is all our own fault.

Wife--But you say me he is great, much great, has much

great ower, can makee kill when he will, why he no makee
ill ivxen you no serve him? No say Oh! to him, no be
good mans.

W A.-That is true, he might strike me dead; and I
ought to ex ect it, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is
true; but ad is merciful, and does not deal with us as we
deserve.

Wife--But then you do not tell God thankee for that too ?

W. A.--No, indeed I have not thanked God for his mercy,
any more than I have feared God for his power.
er.--Then you God no God ; me no think believe he be
such one, great much power strong -: no makee kill you,
thou h you make him much an ry. _

"grip--What! will my wie'ed life hinder on from be-
lieving in God? What a dreadful creature am i and what
a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the
conversion of heathens l

er.--How me think you have great much God up there
gshe points up to heaven] and yet no 0 well, do no good thing ?

me he no tell what you do?

W A.--Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things ; he hears us
speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do
not s eak.

d if'e.--Whatl he no hear you curse, swear, speak de great
amn.

W A.--Yes, yes, he hears it all.

Wz' e.--Where be then the much great power strong ?

. A.--He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and
this proves him to be the true God : he is God, and not man,
and therefore we are not consumed.

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think
how he could tell his wife so clear] that God sees, and hears,
and knows the secret thoughts of t e heart, and all that we do,
and et that he had dared to do all the vile things he had done.

fife--Merciful I What you call that ?

. A.--He is our father and maker, and he pities and
spares us.

'Wzfi.--So then he never makee kill, never angry when you
do wicked ; then he no good himself, or no great . ble.

W. A.--Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infi-
nitely great, and able to punish too ; and sometimes, to show
his justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anger: to destroy sin-
ners and make examples ; many are cut off in their sins.

Mfe.--But no makee kill you yet ; then he tell you, ma
be, that he no makee you kill : so you makee de bargain wit
him, you do bad thing, he no be angry at you when he be an-
gry at other mans.

W A.--No, indeed ; my sins are all presumptions upon his
goodness ; and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me,
as he has done other men.

Wye--Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead : what
you say to him for that? You no tell him thankee for all
that too ?

W A.--I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog ; that is true.
er.--Why he no makee you much good better ? you say
he makee you.

W. A.--He made me as he made all the world. It is I have
deformed myself, and abused his goodness, and made myself
an abominable wretch.

Vsza--I wish you makee God know me. I no makee him
an ry--I no do bad, wicked thing.

ere Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a

cor untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and

he such a wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her

about God, but what the reproach of his own carriage would

make most irrational to her to believe ; nay, that already she

had told him that she could not believe in God, because he,
that was so wicked, was not destroyed. >>

TV. A.--My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to
know God, not God to know you ; for he knows you already,
and every thought in your heart. --

Wife--Why, then, he know what I say to you now : he
know me wish to know him. How shall me know who makes
me ?

W A.--Poor creature ! he must teach thee : I cannot teach
thee : I will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and for-
give me, that am unworthy to teach thee.

The poor fellow was in such agony at her desiring him to
make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that he
said he fell down on his knees before her, and prayed to God
to enlighten her mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the un-
worthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of relig-
ion : after which he sat down by her again, and their dialogue
went on. This was the time when we saw him kneel down
and hold u his hands.

Wafe-- hat you at down the knee for? What you hold
11 the hand for ? Vhat you say? Who you speak to?
\ hat is all that.

W A.--My dear, I bow my knees in token of my sub-
miss'idn to him that made me. I said Oh ! to him, as you call
it, and as your old men do to their idol Benamuckee ; that is,
I pra ed to him.

1sze.----What say you Oh ! to him for ?

. A.----I prayed to him to 0 en your eyes and your under-
standing, that ou may know im, and be accepted by him.

7% e.--Can e do that too?

. A.--Yes, he can: he can do all things.
Wife--But now he hear what you as ?

W. A.--Yes, he has bid us pray to im, and promised to
hear us.

Wafe--Bid you pray? When be bid you ? How he bid
you ! What you hear him speak ?

W." A.---No, we do not hear him speak ; but he has revealed
himself many ways to us.

Here he was at a reat loss to make herunderstand that God
has revealed himse to us by his Word, and what his Word
was ; but at last he told it her thus :

W. A.--God has spoken to some good men in former days,
even from heaven, by Iain words ; and God has inspired good
mfin lLy his Spirit; and they have written all his laws down in
a 00 .

Wife--Me no understand that; where is book ?

1V. A.--A1as ! my poor creature, I have not this book ; but I
hop; .1 shall one time or other get it for you, and help you to
rea it.

Here he embraced her with great afiection, but with inex-
pressible grief that he had not a Bible.

Wife--But how you makes me know that God teachee them
to write that book ?

WI A..---B the same rule that we know him to be God.

Wife.-- hat rule ? What way you know him ?

W A.--Because he teaches and commands nothing but what
is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us erfectly
good, as well as perfectly happy ; and because he for ids, and
commands us to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in itself,
or evil in its consequence.

Wife--That me would understand, that me fain see ; if he
teachee all good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all
thing, he hear me when I say Oh I to him, as you do just now ;
he makes me good, if I wish to be ood ; he spare me, no
makee kill me, when I no be good ; aligthis you say he do, yet
he be great God : me take, think, believe him to be great God :
me say Oh I to him with on, my dear.

Here the poor man cou d forbear no longer, but raised her
up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to in-
struct her in the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit ; and that
by some good providence, if possible, she might, some time or
other, come to have a Bible, that she might read the Word of
God, and be taught by it to know him. This was the time
that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and saw him kneel
down by her, as above.

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too
long to be set down here; and particularly, she made him
promise that, since he confessed his own life had been a wicked,
abominable course of provocations against God, that he would
reform it, and not ma e God angry any more, lest he should
make him dead, as she called it, and then she would be left
alone, and never be taught to know this God better : and lest
he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked men would
be, after death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both,
but articularly to the young clergyman; he was, indeed,
won erfully surprised with it, but under the greatest afliic-
tion imaginable that he could not talk to her, that he could
not speak English, to make her understand him; and as she
spoke but very broken English, he could not understand her;
however, he turned himself to me, and told me that he be-
lieved that there must be more to do with this woman than
to marry her. I did not understand him at first; but at
length he explained himself, viz., that she ought to be bap-
tized. I agreed with him in part readily, and wished it to be
done presently. "No, no ; Iold, sir," said he; "though I
would have her be baptized, b all means, for I must observe
that Will Atkins, her husban , has indeed brought her, in a
wonderful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life,
and has given her just ideas of the being of a God, of his

ower, justice, and mercy ; yet I desire to now of him if he

as said anything to her of esus Christ, and of the salvation
of sinners ; of the nature of faith in him, and redemption by
him ; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment,
and the future state. '

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor
fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said
somethin to her of all those things, but that he was himself
so wicke a creature, and his own conscience so reproaehed
him with his horrid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the ap-
prehension that her knowledge of him should lessen the at-
tention she should give to those things, and make her rather
contemn religion than receive it ; but he was assured, he said,
that her mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of
all those things, that if I would but discourse With her, she
would make it ap ear to my satisfaction that my labor would
not be lost upon lier.

Accordingly, I called her in, and lacing myself as inter-
preter between my religious priest and) the woman, I entreated

im to begin with her; but sure such a sermon was never
preached by a Popish priest in these latter ages of the world ;
and, as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the
knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error
of a Roman Catholic; and that I took him to be such a
clergyman as the Roman bishops were before the church of
Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of
men. In a word, he brou ht the cor woman to embrace the
knowledge of Christ, an of re emption by him, not with
wonder and astonishment only,as she did the first notions of a
God, but with joy and faith ; with an affection, and a surpris-
ing degree of understanding, scarce to be imagined,much less
to be expressed ; and, at her own request, she was ba tized.

When he was preparing to baptize her I entreatcd im that
he would perform that office with some caution, that the man
might not perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible,
because of other ill consequences which might attend a dif-
ference among us in that very religion which we were in-
structing the other in. He told me that as he had no con-
secrated cha e1, nor proper things for the oflice, I should
see he woul do it in a manner that I should not know by it
that he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known
it before; and so he did; for saying only some words
over to himself in Latin, which I could not understand, he
poured a whole dishful of water "$2" the woman's head, pro-
nouncing in French, very loud, " ary {which was the name
her husband desired me to give her, for was her godfather],
I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost ;" so that none could know anything by it
what religion he was of. He gave the benediction afterwards
in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know butit was French,
or else did not take notice of it at that time.

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and after the
marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very
affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in
that good disposition he was in,but to support the convictions
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; told
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake
his crimes: represented to him how God had honored him
with being the instrument of brin ing his wife to the know-
ledge of the Christian religion, an that he should be careful
he should not dishonor the grace of God; and that if he did,
he would see the heathen a better Christian than himself;
the savage converted, and the instrument cast away. He
said a great many good things to them both; and then rec-
ommending them to God's goodness, gave them the bene-
diction again, I repeating everything to them in English;
and thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleas-
p'rtrt and agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my whole
1 e. -
But m clergyman had not done yet: his thoughts hung
continual y upon the conversion of t e thirty-seven savages,
and fain he would have stayed upon the island to have under-
taken it ; but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was
impracticable in itself ; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put
it into a wa of being done in his absence to his satisfaction.

Having t us brought the affairs of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the
young man I had taken out of the famished ship's company
came to me, and told me he understood I had a clergyman
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married
to the savages; that he had a match too, which he desired
might be finished before I went, between two Christians
which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me. a

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the
island: so I began to persuade him not to do an thing of
that kind rashly, or because he found himself in this solitary
circumstance. I represented to him that he had some con-
siderable substance in the world, and good friends, as I under-
stood by himself, and the maid also; that the maid was not
only poor, and a servant, but was unequal to him, she being
six or seven and twenty years old, and he not above seventeen
or eighteen ; that he might very probably, with my assist-
ance, make a remove from this wilderness, and come into his
own country again ; and that then it would be a thousand to
one but he would repent his choice, and the dislike of that
circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was
going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling, and told
me, with a great deal of modest , that I mistook in my
guesses; that he had nothing of t )at kind in his thoughts;
and he was very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting
therg in a way to see their own country again ; and nothing
should have made him think of stayin there, but that the
voyage I was going was so exceeding ong and hazardous,
and would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends;
that he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle
him in some little property in the island where he was, give
him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he would
live here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I
returned to England, I would redeem him ; and he ed I
would not be unmindful of him when I came to Eng and:
that he would give me some letters to his friends in London,
to let them know how good I had been to him, and in what
part of the world, and what circumstances I had left him in :
and he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, the plan-
tation, and all the im rovements he had made upon it, let the
value be what it won d, should be wholly mine.

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his
youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he told me
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all
possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to England, I
would deliver his letters, and do his business effectually ; and
that he might depend I should never forget the circumstances
I had left him in; but still I was impatient to know who was
the person to be married ; upon which he told me it was my
J ack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably
surprised when he named the match; for, indeed, I thought
it very suitable. The character of that man I have given al-
ready; and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober, and religious young woman ; had a very good share of
sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very hand-
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good
manners, and was neither too backward to speak when requi-
site, nor impertinently forward when it was not her business ;
very hand and housewifely, and an excellent manager; fit,
indeed, to ave been governess to the whole island; and she
knew very well how to behave in every respect.

The match bein pro osed in this manner, we married them
the same day; ang as f was father at the altar, and gave her
away, so I gave her a ortion; for I appointed her and her
husband a handsome gage space of ground for their planta--
tion ; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the young
gentleman made to give him a small property in the island,
put me upon parceling it out amongst them, that they might
not quarrel afterwards about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfect]
reformed, exceedingly pious and religious; and, as far as
may be allowed to speak positivel in such a case, I verily
believe he was a true penitent. e divided things so justly,
and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I
caused to be drawn up and signed and sealed, setting out the
bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and testifying
that I gave them thereb severally a right to the whole posses-
sion and inheritance o the respective plantations or farms,nonmson GBUSOE. 3 49

with their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all
the rest of the island as my own property, and a certain rent
for every particular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any
one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing an
attested copy of the same writing.

As to the government and laws amongst them, I told them I
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were
able to give themselves ; only I made them promise me to live
in love and good neighborhood with one another; and so I
pre ared to leave them.

ne thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and
having much business in hand, it was odd to have seven and
thirty Indians live in a nook of the island independent, and,
indeed, unem loyed ; for, excepting the providing themselves
food, which t ey had difficulty enough to do, sometimes they
had no manner of business or ropert to manage. I roposed
therefore, to the governor paniar , that he shoul go to
them with Frida 's father, and propose to them to remove,
and either plant or themselves, or be taken into their several
families as servants, to be maintained for their labor, 'but with.
out being absolute slaves; for I would not permit them to
make them slaves b force, by an means; because they had
their liberty given them by capitu ation, as it were articles of
surrender, which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all
very cheerfully alongl with him: so we allotted them land
and plantations, whic three or four accepted of, but all the
rest chose to be employed as servants in the several families
we had settled ; and thus my colony was in a manner settled
as follows : The Spaniards possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital city, and extended their plantations all
along the side of the brook, which made the creek that I have
so often described, as far as my bower ; and as they increased
their culture, it went always eastward. The English lived in
the northeast part, where Will Atkins and his comrades be-
gan, and came on southward and southwest, towards the back
part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great addi-
tion of land to take in, if they found occasion, so that they
need not jostle one another for want of room. All the east
end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any of the sav-
ages should come on shore there only for their usual cus-
tomary barbarities, the might come and go ;, if they disturbed
nobody, nobody wou d disturb them ; and no doubt but
they were often ashore, and went away again, for I never
heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any
more.

It now came into my thou hts that I had hinted to my friend
the clergyman that the war of converting the savages might
perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction, and I
told him that now I thou ht that it was put in a fair way ; for
the savages, being thus divided among the Christians, 1f the
would but everyone of them do their part with those whic 1
came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very good
effect.

He agreed presentl in that, if they did their part. "But
how," sa s he, "shall we obtain that of them? " I told him
we woul call them all together, and leave it in charge with
them, or go to them, one b one, which he thought best; so
we divided it,----he to spea to the Spaniards, who were all
Papists, and I to speak to the English, who were all Protest-
ants ; and we recommended it earnestly to them, and made them
promise that they would never make any distinction of Papist
or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians,
but teach them the eneral knowledge of the true God, and of
their Saviour Jesus ehi-ist ; and they likewise promised us that
they would never have any difierences or disputes one with an-
other about religion.

When I eame to Will Atkins' house (I may call it so, for such
a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe was not stand-
ing in the world again), there I found the young woman I have
mentioned above and Will Atkins' wife were become intimates ;
and this prudent, religious young woman had perfected the
work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not above
four days after what I have related, yet the new-baptized sav-
a e woman was made such a Christian as I have seldom heard
0 in all my observations or conversation in the world.

It came next into In mind in the morning before I went to
them, that amongst al the needful things I had to leave with
them, I had not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself
less considerin for them than my good friend the widow was
for me when 5 e sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds from
Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater extent than
ever she ima ined, for they were reserved for the comfort and
instruction 0 those that made much better use of them than
I had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to
Will Atkins' tent, or house, and found the young woman and
Atkins' baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together
--for Will "Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy--I asked
if they were together now, and he said, yes ; so I went into the
house and he with me, and we found them together very earn-
est in discourse. 'F 0h, sir," says Will Atkins, " when God has
sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring home, he
never wants a messenger; my wife has got a new instructor;
I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapable of that work ; that
young woman has been sent hither from heaven ; she is enough
to convert a whole island of savages." The young woman
blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desired her to sit still ;
I told her she had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped
God would bless her m it.

We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had any
book among them, though I did not ask ; but I put my hand
into my pocket, and pulled out my Bible. " Here," said I to
Atkins," I have brought you an assistant that perhaps you had
not before." The man was so confounded, that he was not able
to speak for some time; but recovering himself, he takes it
with both his hands, and turning to his Wife, " Here, my dear,"
says he, "did I not tell you our God, thou h he lives above,
could hear what we have said ? Here's theiook I pra ed for
when you and I kneeled down under the bush ; now ad has
heard us and sent it." When he had said so, the man fell into
such transports of passionate joy, that between the joy of
having it, and ivin God thanks for it, the tears ran down
his face like a c ild t at was crying.

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a
mistake that none of us were aware of, for she firmly believed
God had sent the book upon her husband's petition. It is true
that providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a con-
sequent sense; but I believe it would have been no diflicult
matter at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to have
believed that an express messenger came from heaven on pur-
pose to bring that individual book ; but it was too serious a
matter to suffer any delusion to take place, so I turned to the
young woman, and told her we did not desire to impose upon
the new convert in her first and more ignorant understanding
of things, and be ged her to explain to her that God may be
very properly sai to answer our petitions, when, in the course
of his providence, such things are in aparticular manner brought
to pass as we petitioned for ; but we did not expect returns from
heaven in a miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy
that it is not so.

_ This the young woman did afterwardseflectually, so that there
was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here ; and I should have
thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to
have had it so. But the surprise of joy upon \Vill Atkins is
really not to be expressed ; and there we may be sure was no
delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the world
for anything of its kind than he.was for the Bible ; nor, I be-
lieve, never any man was glad of a Bible from a better princi-
ple ; and though he had been a most profligate creature, head-
strong, furious, and des erately wicked, yet this man is a stand-
ing rule to us all for t e well instructing children, viz., that
parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever

espair of the success of their endeavors, let the children be
ever so refractory, or, to appearance, insensible to instruction ;
for, if ever God in his providence touches the conscience of
such, the force of their education returns upon them, and the
early instruction of parents is not lost, though it may have
been many years laid asleep, but some time or other they may
find the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man ; how-
ever ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he
found he' had some to do with now more ignorant than himself,
and that the least part of the instruction of his good father that
now came to his mind was of use to him.

Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his father
used to insist so much on the inexpressible value of the Bible,
and the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and
persons ; ut he never entertained the least notion of the worth
of it till now, when being to talk to heathens, savages, and
barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for his
assistance.

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion,
though she had one and so had the youth, on board our ship,
among their goods, which were not yet brought on shore. And
now, aving said so many things of this young woman, I can-
not omit telling one story more of her and m self, which has
something in it very instructive and remarkab e.

I have related to what extremity the oor oung woman was
reduced,--how her mistress was starved, to (death, and died on
board that unhappy shi we met at sea, and how the ship's
com any was reduced tot elast extremity. The gentlewoman,
and er son, and this maid, were first hardly used as to pro-
visions, and at last totally neglected and starved--that is to say,
brought to the last extremity of hunger. One day, being dis-
coursing with her on the extremities they suffered, I asked her
if she could describe, by what she had felt, what it was to starve,
and how it appeared. She told me she believed she could, and

she told her tale very distinctly thus;
" First, sir," said she, " we had for some days fared exceeding
hard, and sufiered very great hunger; but at last we were
wholly without food of any kind, exce t sugar, and a little
wine and water. The first day after I ad received no food
at all,I found in self, towards evening, first empty and sick at
the stomach, an; nearer night much inclined to yawning and
sleep. I lay down on the couch in the great cabin to sleep, and
slept about three hours, awaked a little refreshed, having taken
a glass of wine when I lay down; after being about three
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I
found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down
again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and
thus I continued all the second day with a strange variety--
first hungr , then sick again, with retchings to vomit. he
second mg t, being obliged to go to bed again without an
food more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep,
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily
stocked with provisions--that I bou ht some for my mistress,
and went and dined very heartily. Ithought my stomach was
as full after this as it would have been after a good din-
ner ; but when I awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits,
to find myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass of
wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its hav-
ing some splirits to sugply nourishment, but there being no sub-
stance in t e stomac for the digesting office to wor upon, I
found the only effect of the Wine was to raise disa reeable
fumes from the stomach into the head ; and I lay, as t ey told
me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The
third day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused,
and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I
awaked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question,
had not my understanding returned and conquered it, whether,
if I had been a mother, and had had a little child with me, its
life would have been safe or not. This lasted about three
hours, during which time I was twice raging mad as any crea-
ture in Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can
now inform you.

"In one of those fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down
"and struck my face a ainst the corner of a pallet-bed,
in which my mistress ay, and with the blow the blood
gushed out of my nose ; and the cabin-boy bringing me
a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and
as the blood came from me, I came to myself, and the vio-
lence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the
ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and retched
to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to
brin u .

" tgr I had bled some time I swooned, and they all be-
Iieved I was dead ; but I came to myself soon after, and then
had a most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described
--not like the colic, but a gnawing eager pain for food, and
towards night it went off with a ind of earnest wishing or
longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the longing of
a woman with child. I took another draught of water with
sugar in it ; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought
it all up again ; then I took a draught of water without sugar,
and that stayed with me ; and I laid me down upon the bed,
praying most heartily that it would please God to take me
away; and composing my mind in hopes of it I slumber-ed
awhile, and then waking, thought myself dying, being light
with vapors from an empty stomach. I recommended my
soul then to God, and earnestly wished that somebody would
throw me into the sea.

" All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought,
expiring, but bore it with much more patience than I-----gave
the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young mas-
ter, who would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat
it ; and I believe it saved his life.

" Towards the morning I slept again ; and when I awoke I
fell into a violent passion of crying, and after that had a sec-
ond fit of violent unger. I got up ravenous, and in a most
dreadful condition ; had my mistress been dead, as much as I
loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh
with as much relish and as unconcerned as ever I did eat the
flesh of any creature appointed for food ; and once or twice I
was going to bite in own arm. At last I saw the basin in
whic was the blood had bled at m nose the day before : I
ran to it, and swallowed it with such aste, and such a greedy
appetite, as if I wondered that nobody had taken it before,
and afraid it should be taken from me now. After it was
down, though the thoughts of it filled me with horror, at it
checked the fit of hunger, and I took another draug t of
water, and was composed and refreshed for some hours after.
This was the fourth day; and thus I kept up till towards
night, when, within the compass of three hours, I had all the
several circumstances over again one after another, viz., sick,
sleepy, eagerly hungry, ain in the stomach, then ravenous
again, then sick, then unatic, then crying, then ravenous
again, and so every quarter of an hour, and my strength
wasted exceedingly; at night I lay me down, having no com-
fort but in the hope that I should die before morning.

" All this ni ht I had no slee ; but the hunger was now
turned into a disease ; and I had) a terrible colic and riping,
by wind, instead of food, having found its way into the %owels ;
and in this condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised
by the cries and lamentations of my young master, who called
out to me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up a little,
for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead,
thou h she was able to give very little signs of life.

" had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of
some sustenance, as I cannot describe; with such frequent
throes and pangs of a petite, as nothing but the tortures of
death can imitate ; an in this condition I was when I heard
the seamen above cry out, 'A sail! a sail l' and halloo and
jum about as if they were distracted.

" was not able to get of from the bed, and m mistress
much less ; and my young master was so sick that thought
he had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin door,
or get any account what it was that occasioned such confusion ;
nor had we had any conversation with the ship's company
for two days, they having told us that they had not a mouth-
ful of anything to eat in the ship ; and this they told us after-
wards--they thought we had been dead. It was this dread-
ful condition we were in when you were sent to save our lives;
andnhow you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better
too.

This was her own relation, and in such a distinct account of
starving to death as, I confess, I never met with, and was ex-
ceeding entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe
it to be a true account, because the youth gave me an account
of a good part of it ; though I must own, not so distinct and
so feelinrr as the maid; and the rather because it seems his
mother fled him at the price of her own life; but the 001'
maid, though her constitution being stronger than that 0 her
mistress, who was in years, and a wealfiy woman too, she
might struggle harder with it ; I say, the poor maid might be
supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her
mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last bit something
longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid. No
question, as the case is here related, if our ship, or some.
other, had not so providentially met them, a few days more
would have ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it
by eating one another; and that, even as their case stood,
would have served them but a little while, they being five
hundred leagues from any land, or an possibility of relief,
other than in the miraculous manner it happened : but this is
by tlie way 3 I return to my disposition of things among the
co e.

p Alhd, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I
did not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had
framed, and which I thou ht of setting up among them; for
I found, at least at my rst coming, such seeds of division
among them, that I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and
left it among them, they would, upon eve light dis ust,
have separated, and gone away from one anot er; or per aps
have turned pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves,
instead of a plantation of sober and religious people, as I in-
tended it; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass canon that
I_had on board, or the two qnarterdeck guns that my nephew
took extraordinary, for the same reason : I thought it was
enough to qualify them for a defensive war a ainst any that
should invade them, but not to set them up or an ofiensive
war, or to o abroad to attack others; which, in the end,
would only ring ruin and destruction upon them: I reserved
the sloo , therefore, and the nns, for their service another
way, as shall observe in its p ace.

Having now done with the island,I left them all in good
circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on
board In ship again on the 6th of May, having" been about
twenty- ve days among them ; and as they were all resolved
to stay upon the island till I came to remove them,I promised
to send them farther relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly
find an opportunity; and particularlyI promised to send them
some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows. As to the two
cows and calves which I brought from England, we had been
obliged, by the len h of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for
want of bay to fee them.

The next da , giving them a salute of five guns at parting,
we set sail, an arrived at the bay of All Saints in the Brazi s
in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our
passage but this: that about three days after we had sailed,

eing becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E.N.E.,
runnmg,as it were, into a bay or gulf on the land side, we
were driven something out of our course, and once or twice
our men cried out, " Land to the eastward l" but whether it
was the continent or islands we could not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth, and the
weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered towards the
land with something very black; not being able to discover
what it was, till after some time, our chief mate, going up the
mainshrouds a little way, and looking at them with a perspective,
cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant
by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily. " Nay, sir,"
sa s be, " don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too; for
I elieve there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them
paddle along, for they are coming towards us apace."

I was a little surprised then,indeed,and so was my nephew,
the captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in
the island, and having never been in those seas before, that he
could not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three times,
we should all be devoured. I must confess, considering we
were becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore,
I liked it the worse ; however, I bade them not be afraid, but
bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to
know that we must. engage them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace towards
us ; so I gave orders to come to an anchor and furl all our
sails. As for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear
but fire, and therefore they should get their boats out, and
fasten them, one close b the head, and the other by the stern,
and man them both well, and wait the issue in that posture ;
this I did, that the men in the boats might be ready with
sheets and buckets to put out any fire these savages might
endeavor to fix to the outside of the ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they came with us; but never was such horrid sight seen b
Christians: though my mate was much mistaken in his ca -
culation of their number, yet when they came up we reckoned
about a hundred and twenty-six ; some of them had sixteen
or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the least six or
seven.

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless
they had never seen before ; nor could they at first," we
afterwards understood, know what to make of us ; they came
boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about
to row round us ; but we called to our men in the boats not
to let them come too near them. This very order brought us
to an engagement with them, without our designing it; for
five or six of the large canoes came so near our longboat, that
our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which
they understood very well, and went back ; but at their retreat
about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats, and one
'of our men in the longboat was very much wounded.' How-
ever, I called to them not to fire by any means ; but we handed
down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter pres-
ently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them
from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again.

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body
astern of us, and so near that we could easily discern what
they were, though we could not tell their design ; and I easily
found the were some of my old friends, the same sort of sav-
ages that had been used to engage with ; and in a short time
more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came di-
rectly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight upon
us, till they came so near that they could hear us s ea ' ; upon
this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they s ould shoot
any more arrows, and made all our guns ready; but being so
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck, and call out aloud to them in his lanouage, to know what
they meant ; which accordingly he did. Whether they under-
stood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he called to
them, six of them, who were in the foremost or nighest boat to
us, turned their canoes from us, and stooping down, showed
us their naked backs ; whether this was a defiance or challenge
we know not, or whether it was done in mere contempt, or as
a signal to the rest: but immediately Friday cried out they
were going to shoot, and, unhappily for him, poor fellow, they
let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inex-
pressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three ar-
rows, and about three more fell very near him ; such unlucky
marksmen they were l .

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and
companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a
broadside as they had never heard in their lives before, to be
sure. They were not above half a cable's len th ofi when we
fired ; and our gunners took their aim so well t lat three or four
of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by
one shot only.

The ill manners of turning 11 their bare backs to us gave
us no great offense ; neither (li I know for certain whether
that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us
mi ht. be understood so by them or not ; therefore, in return, I
ha only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with
powder only, which I knew would frighten them sufficiently :

ut when they shot at us directly with all the fury they were
capable of, and especiall as they had killed 'my poor Friday,
whom I so entirely love and valued, and who, indeed, so well
deserved it, I thou ht myself not only justifiable before God
and man, but woulf have been ver glad if I could have over-
set every canoe there, and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we
wounded at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry
never were seen among such a multitude; there were thirteen
or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, and the men
all set a-swimming : the rest, frightened out of their wits,
scoured awa as fast as they could, takin but little care to
save those whose boats were split or spoile with our shot; so
I suppose that many of them were lost; and our men took up
one poor fellow, swimming for his life, above an hour after
the were all gone.

he small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound
a great many ; but, in short, we never knew how it went with
them, for they fled so fast that, in three hours or thereabouts,
we could not see above three or four straggling canoes, nor did
we ever see the rest any more ; for a breeze 0 wind springing
up the same evening, we weighed, and set sail for the Brazils.
,We had a risoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen
that he woul neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he
would starve himself to death : but I took a way to cure him ;
for I made them take him and turn him into the longboat, and
make him believe they would toss him into the sea.again, and
so leave him where they found him, if he would not speak:
nor, would that do, but they really did throw him into the sea,
and came away from him ; and then he followed them, for he
swam like a cork, and called to them in his tongue, though they
knew not one word of what he said ; however, at last, they
took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable:
nor did I ever design they should drown him.

We were now under sail again, but I was the most discon-
aolate creature alive for want of my man Frida , and would
have'been very glad to have gone back to the is and, to have
taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion, but it could
not be ; so we went on. We had one risoner, as I have said,
and it was a long time before we coul make him understand
anything; but, in time, our men 'tau ht him some English,
and he began to be a little tractable. ifterwards, we inquired
what country he came from, but could make nothing of what
he said ; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and he spoke
in the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we could
never form a word after him ; and we were all of opinion that
they might speak that language as well if they were gagged
as otherwise ; nor could we perceive that the had any occa-
sion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, ut formed their
words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an open throat.
He told us, however, some time after, when we had taught him
to speak a little English, that they were oing with their kings
to fight a great battle. When he said ings, we asked him
how many kings. He said they were five nation (we could
not make im understand the plural s), and that they all joined
to go against two nation. We asked him what made them come
up to us. He said, " To makee te great wonder look." Here
it is to be observed, that all those natives, as also those of Africa,
when they learn English, alwa s add two e's at the end of the
words where we use one ; and t ey lace the accent upon them,
as makee, takee, and the like ; na , could hardly make Friday
leave it 011', though at last he did: And now I name the oor
fellow once more, I must take my last leave of him. 001'
honest Friday! We buried him with all the decency and sol-
emnity possi Is, by putting him into a cofiin, and throwing
him into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven uns for
him ; and so ended the life of the most grateful, aithful,
honest, and most affectionate servant that ever man had.

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in
about twelve da s' time we made land, in the latitude of five
degrees south 0 the line, bein the northeasternmost land of
all that part of America. We ept on S. by E., in sight of the
shore four days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in
three days came to an anchor of the bay of All Saints, the old
place of my deliverance, from whence came both my good and
evil fate.

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I
had, and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted
to hold the least correspondence on shore : not my partner
himself, who was alive, and made a great figure among them 3
not my two merchant-trustees ; not the fame of my wonder-
ful preservation in the island, could obtain me that favor ; but
my partner, rememberin that I had given five hundred moi-
dores to the Prior of the ifonastery of the Augustines, and two
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery,
and obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor, and
get leave for me personally, with the captain and one more, be-
sides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more ; and this
upon condition, absolutely capitulated for, that we would not
offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person
away without licence. They were so strict with us, as to land-
ing any goods, that it was with extreme difiicult that I ct
on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine roadclot s,
studs, and some linen, which I had brought for a present to
my partner.

He was a very generous, open-hearted man ; though, like me,
he began with little at first ; and though he knew not that I
had the least desi n of iving him anything, he sent me on
board a present 0 fresE provisions, wine, and sweetmeats
worth above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and
three or four fine medals of gold ; but I was even with him in
my resent, which, as I have said, consisted of fine broadcloth,
Eng ish studs, lace, and fine Hollands ; also, I delivered him
about the value of one hundred pounds sterling, in the same
goods, for other uses ; and I obliged him to set up the sloop,
which I had brought with me from En land, as I have said, for
the use of my colony, in order to sen the refreshments I in-
tended to my plantation.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in avery few
days, for she was already framed; and I gave the master of
her such instructions that he could not miss the place ; nor did
he, as I had an account from my partner afterwards. I got him
soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them ; and one of our
seamen, that had been on shore with me there, offered to go
with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter to the gover-
nor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of land for
a plantation and giving him some clothes and tools for his
planting work, which he said he understood, having been
an old planter at Maryland, and a bnccaneer into the bargain.
Ieneouraoed the fellow by granting all he desired ; and, as an
additionj gave him the savage whom we had taken prisoner
of war, to be his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to
give him his share of eve hing he wanted with the rest.

When we came to fit t is man out, In old partner told me
there was a certain ver honest fellow, a. razil planter of his ac-
quaintance, who had fa len into the displeasure of the church. " I
know not what the matter is with him," says he, " but, on my
conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has been
obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition ;" that he
won (1 be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape,
with his wife and two daughters ; and if I would let them go to
my island, and allot them a plantation, he would give them a
small stock to begin with--for the ofiicers of the Inquisition had
seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a
little household stuff, and two slaves. " And," adds he,
_" though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him fall
into their hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive if he
does."

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with
them ; and we concealed the man, and his wife and dau liters,
on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea ; an then,
having put all their goods on board some time before, we put
them on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay.

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner ; and
their stocks, indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in prepara-
tions, and a farm,----but nothin to begin with, except as above :
however, they carried ever With them what was worth all the
rest, some material for planting sn ar-canes, with some plants
of canes, which he--I mean the ortugal man--understood
ver well.

mong the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the
island, I sent them by the sloop three milch-cows and five calves,
about twenty-two hogs among them, threesows big with pig,
two mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards, according
to my promise, I engaged three Portugal women to go, and rec-
ommended it to them to marry them and use them kindly. I
could have procured more women, but I "remembered that the
poor persecuted man had two daughters and that there were but
ve of the Spaniards that wanted--the rest had wives of their
own, though in another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose,
was ver welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with
this ad ition, between sixty and seventy people, besides little
children, of which there were a great many. I found letters
at London from them all, b way of Lisbon, when I came back
to England, of which I s all also take some notice imme-
diate] .

I bribe now done with the island, and all manner of discourse
about it : and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums
would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect
to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own
harms, much less by those of other men, to beware: not cooled
by almost forty years' miseries and disappointments; not satis-
fied with prosperity be ond expectation, nor made cautious by
afllictions and distress eyond imitation.

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man
at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate and desire
him to lock him up among the prisoners there and starve him.
Had I taken a small vessel from England, and gone directly to
the island; had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all
the necessaries for the plantation, and for my peo 1e; taken
a patent from the government here to have secure my prop-
erty in subjection only to that of England ; had I carried over
cannon and ammunition, servants and people to plant, and taken
possession of the place, fortified and strengthened it in the name
of England, and increased it with eople, as I might easily have
done ; had I then settled mysel there, and sent the ship back
laden with good rice, as I might also have done in six months'
time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out a ain for our
supply ; had I done this, and stayed there myself, I red at least
acted like a man of common sense: but I was possessed of a
wandering spirit, andscorned all advantages : I pleased myself
with being the atron of the people I placed there, and doing for
them in a king of haught , majestic wa , like an old patri-
archal monarch, providing or them as if had been father of
the whole family as well as of the plantation: but I never so
much as pretended to plant in the name of any government or
nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call my people
subjects to any one nation more than another: na , I never
so much as gave the place a name, but left it as found it,
belonging to nobody, and the people under no discipline or
government but my own; who, though I bad influence over
them as a father and benefactor, had no authority or power to act
or command one wa or other, farther than voluntary consent
moved them to comp y ; et even this, had I stayed there, would
have done well enough : ut as I rambled from them and came
there no more, the last letters I had from any of them were by
my partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop to the
place and who sent me word, though I had not the letter till I
got to London, several years after it was written, that they went
on but oorly ; were discontented with their long stay there;
that ' ill Atkins was dead; that five of the S aniards were
come away ; and though they had not been muc molested by
the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes with them ; and
that they be ged of him to write to me to think of the prom-
ise I had made to fetch them away, that they might see their
coun'tr again before they died.

Butlwas gone a wild goose chase indeed ! and they that will
have any more of me must be content to follow me into a new
variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the
iustice of Providence may be duly observed ; and we may see
|0W easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make
the strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish us most
severely with those very things which we think it would be our
utmost happiness to be allowed in. WhetherI had business or
no business, away I went: it is no time now to enlarge upon
the reason or absurdity of my own conduct but to come to the
history--I was embarked for the voyage, and the voyage Iwent.
I shall only add a word or two concerning m honest Popish
clergyman ; for let their opinions of us, and a 1 other heretics
in general, as they call us, be as uncharitable as it may, I
verily believe this man was very sincere, and wished the good
of all men : yet I believe he was upon the reserve in many of
his expressions, to prevent giving me offense; for I scarce
heard him once call on the Blessed Virgin, or mention St. J ago,
or his uardian angel, though so common with the rest of
them.; owever, I say, I had not the least doubt of his sin-
cerity and pious intentions; and I am firmly of opinion if the
rest of the Popish missionaries were like him, they would
strive to visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders, where
they have nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to
India, Persia, China, etc., the most wealthy of the heathen
countries; for if they expected to bring no gains to their
church b it, it may well be admired how they came to ad-
mit the hinese Confucius into the calendar of the Christian
saints;

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious riest asked
me leave to go thither ; being still, as he observed, ound never
to finish any voyage he began. How happy it had been for
me if I had gone with him! But it was too late now : all
things Heaven appoints for the best : had I gone with him, I
had never had so many things to be thankful for, and the
reader had never heard of the second part of the travels and
adventures of Robinson Crusoe ; so I must here leave exclaim-
ing at myself, and go on with my voyage. From the Brazils,
we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good
Hope, and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally
southeast, now and then a storm, and some contrary winds :
but my disasters at sea were at an end--my future rubs and
cross events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear
the land was as well pre ared to be our scourge as the sea.

Our ship was on a tra in voyage, and had a supercargo on
board, who was to direct a 1 her motions after she arrived at
the Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days for
stay, by charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to.
This was none 0 my business, neither did I meddle with it ;
my nephew, the captain, and the supercargo adjusting all
those t ings between them as they thought fit.

We stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to take
in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast of
Coromandel. We were, indeed, informed that a French man-
of--war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were
gone for the Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with
France, I had some apprehensions of them ; but they went
their own way, and we card no more of them.

I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of
places, journals of our voyages, variations of the compass, lati.
tudes, trade-winds, etc. ; it is enough to name the ports and
places which we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our
passage from one to another. We touched first at the island
of Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and treach-
erous, and very well armed with lances and bows, which the
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with
them awhile; they treated us very civilly; and for some trifles
which we gave them, such as knives, scissors, etc., they brought
us eleven good fat builocks, of a middling size, which we took
in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending, and
the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had fur.
nished ourselves with provisions ; and I, who was always too
curious to look into every nook of the world wherever I came,
went on shore as often as I could. It was on the east side of
the island that we went on shore one evening; and the peo-
ple, who, by the way, are very numerous, came throngiraii
about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance ; but as we h
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger. When we saw the people, we out
three bonghs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance
from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not only
of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other
side set up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they
accept the truce, too ; but then this is a known condition of
the truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles to-
wards them, nor the to come past your three poles, or boughs,
towards you ; so t at you are perfectly secure within the
three poles, and all the space between your oles and theirs is
allowed like a market for free converse, tra c, and commerce.
When you go there you must not carry your wea ons with
you ; and if they come into that space, they stic up their
'avelins and lances all at the first oles, and come on unarmed ;

ut if any violence is oifered t em, and the truce thereby
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their
weapons, and the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a
greater number of their people came down than usual, but all
very friendly and civil ; and they brought several kinds of pro-
visions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we had ;
the women also brought us milk and roots, and several things
very acceptable to us, and all was quiet, and we made us a
little tent or but of some boughs or trees, and lay on shore all
ni ht.

know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at an-
chor at about a stone's cast from the land, with two men in her
to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore ; and
getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I
spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the
cover of the branches of the trees all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of our men
make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out for God's sake
to bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were
all like to be murdered ; at the same time, I heard the fire of
five muskets, which was the number of guns they had, and
that three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were not
so easil fri htened with guns as the savages we're in America,
where half to do with them. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the
noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three
fusees we had on board, to land and assist our men."

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too
much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into
the water, to wet to the boat with all the expedition they could,
being pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with
them ; the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but they were
of small use to them. a

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough
too, three of them being ver ill wounded; and that which
was still worse was, that whi e we stood in the boat to take
our men in, we were in as much danger as they were in on shore ;
for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick that we were
glad to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches, and
two or three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we
had by mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been day-
light, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if they
could have seen but the least part of any of us, they would
have been sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a
little sight of them, as the stood pelting us from the shore
with darts and arrows ; an havin got ready our firearms, we
gave them a volley, that we could ear, by the cries of some of
them, had wounded several ; however, they stood thus in battle
array on the shore till break of da ', which we supposed was
that they might see the better to ta e their aim at us,
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh
our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand u
in the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit
a bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals of distress
to the ship, and, though she rode a league of, yet my nephew,
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the
posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty
well understood us ; and weighing anchor with all speed, he
stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and then
sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to assist us ; but we
called to them not to come too near, telling them what condi-
tion we were in ; however, they stood in near to us, and one of
the men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and kee ing
one boat between him and the enemy, so that they coul not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to
the boat ; upon which we slipped out a little cable, and leaving
our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the arrows ;
we all the while lying close behind the barricado we had made.

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore,
that we could lay her side to the shore, she ran along just b
them, and poured in a broadside among them, loaded wit
pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides
the reat shot, which made a terrible havoc among them.

hen we were got on board, and out of danger, we had
time to examine into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed,
our supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me
upon it; for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not
have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not done
something to provoke them to it. At length, it came out that
an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had brou ht
it Within our poles, and a young woman with her, who a so
brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old woman (whether
she was mother to the young woman or no they could not tell)
was selling us the milk, one of our men ofiered some rudeness
to the wench that was with her, at which the old woman made
a great noise : however, the seaman would not quit his prize,
but carried her out of the old woman's sight among the trees,
it being almost dark; the old woman went away without her,
and, as we may suppose, made an outcry among the people she
came from ; who, upon notice, raised this reat army upon us
in three or four hours, and it was great odds but we had all
been destroyed. .

One of our men was killed with a, lance thrown at him 'ust
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent t ey
had made ; the rest came ofi free, all but the fellow who was
the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enon h for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became of im for a
great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though
the wind presented, and made signals for him, and made our
boat sail up shore and down shore several lea ues, but in vain;
so we were obliged to give him over ; and if e alone had suf-
fered for it, the loss had been less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on
shore once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or
them ; it was the third ni ht after the action that had a great
mind to learn, if I could y any means, what mischief we had
done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again :
but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the men I went with
had been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous as I was brought into by it, With-
out design. .

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship,
besides the su ercargo and myself, and we landed two hours
before midnig t, at the same place where the Indians stood
drawn up on the evening before. I landed here, because my
desi n, as I have said, was chiefly to see if the had quitted
the eld, and if they had left any marks behin them of the
mischief we had done them ; and I thought, if we could sur-
prise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man again

y way of exchange.

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two
bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other.

We neither saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed ;
and we marched up, one body at a distance from the other, to
the place; but at first could see nothing, it being very dark ;
till b and by our boatswain, who led the first party, stumbled
and ell over a dead body. This made them halt awhile ; for
knowing by thecircumstanees that they were at the place where
the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming u there.
We concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which we
knew would be in less than an hour, when we could easily dis'
cern the havoc we had made amon them. We told thirt -two
bodies upon the ground, whereo two were not quite ead ;
some ha an arm and some a leg shot off, and one his head ;
those that were wounded, we supposed, they had carried away.

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all
we could come to the knowledge of, I resolved on going on
board ; but the boatswain and his party sent me word that
they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go
along with them: and if they could find them, as they still
fancied they should, they did not doubt of getting a good
booty; and it might be theyl mi ht find Tom Jeffry there;
that was the man's name we ad 0st.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I know well enough
what answer to have given them; or I should have com-
manded them instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard
fit for us to run, who had a ship and shi loading in our char e,
and a voyage to make which depende very much upon t e
lives of the men ; but as they sent me word they were re-
solved to go, and only asked me and my company to 0 along
with them, I positively refused it, and rose up, for Igwas sit-
ting on the ground, in order to go to the boat. One or two of
the men began to importune me to go ; and when I refused,_
be an to grumble, and sa they were not under my command,
and they would go. " ome, Jack," says one of the men,
"will you go with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he
would,--and then another,---and, in a word, they all left me
but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat.
So the supercargo and I, with t e third man, went back to
the boat, where we told them we would stay for them, and
take care to take in as many of them as should be left ; for I
told them it was a mad thin they were going about, and
an osed most of them would ave the fate of Tom J efiry.

hey told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come ad a ain, and the would take care, etc.; so
away they went. entreated t em to consider the ship and
the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that they
were intrusted with the voya e, in some, measure; that if
they miscarried, the shi mig t be lost for want of their
help, and that they coul not answer for it to God or man.
But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship ;
they were mad ugon their journey : only they gave me good
words, and begge I would not be angry ; that they did not
doubt but the would be back again In about an hour at
farthest; for e Indian town, they said, was not above half
a mile 0E, though they found it above two miles before they
got to it.

Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was
desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as
warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had
every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a istol ; some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had angers, and
the boatswaiu and two more had poleaxes ; besides all which,
they had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes; bolder
fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked
work in the world.

When they went out, their chief desion was plunder, and
they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a cir-
cumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire
with revenge, and made devils of them all.

When the came to the few Indian houses which they
thou ht had een the town, which was not above half a mile
ofi, t ey were under a great disappointment, for there were
not above twelve or thirteen houses ; and where the town
was, or how bi , they knew not. They consulted, therefore,
what to do, an were some time before the could resolve;
for if they fell upon these, they must cut all t eir throats; and
it was ten to one but some of them might escape, it being in
the night, though the moon was up ; and if one escaped, he
would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole
army upon them : again, on the other hand, if they went away
and left those untouched, for the eople were all asleep, they
could not tell which way to look or the town ; however, the
last was the best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and
look for the town as well as they could. They went on a
little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they pres-
ently concluded, would be a good guide to them ; for, they
said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before them or
the town behind them, and if they untied her, they should
see which way she went : if she went back, they had nothing
to say to her; but if she went forward, they would follow
her ; so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags,
and the cow went on before them, directly to the town i
which, as they reported, consisted of above two hundred
houses or huts, and in some of these they found several
families liviua together.

Here they Found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep
could make them; and, first, they called another council, to
consider what they had to do ; and, in a word, they resolved
to divide themselves into three bodies, and so set three houses
on fire in three parts of the town; and as the men came out,
to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they need not be
asked what to do then), and so to search the rest of the houses
for plunder. But they resolved to march silentl first through
the town, and see what dimensions it was of, an if they might
venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would ven-
ture upon them ; but while they were animating one another
to the work, three of them, who were a little before the rest,
called out aloud to them, and told them that they had found
Tom J elfry : they all ran up to the place, where they had
found the poor fellow hanging u naked by one arm, and his
throat out. There was an Indian ouse just by the tree, where
they found sixteen or seventeen of the princi a1 Indians, who
had been concerned in the fray with us be ore, and two or
three of them wounded with our shot ; and our men found they
were awake, and talking one to another in that house, but
knew not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them,
as before, that they swore to one another they would be re-
venged, and that not an Indian that came into their hands
should have any quarter; and to work they went immediately,
and yet not so madly as mi ht be expected from the rage and
fury they were in. Their rst care was to get something that
would soon take fire ; but, after a little search, they found
that would be to no pur ose : for most of the houses were
low, and thatched with age and rushes, of which the country
is full ; so they presently made some wildfire, as we call it, by
wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands, and in a
quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five
places, and particularly that house where the Indians were not
gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened crea-
tures began to rush out to save their lives, but met with their
fate in the attempt; and especially at the door, where they
drove them back, the boatswaiu himself killing one or two
with his poleaxe. The house being large, and many in it, he
did not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenade, and threw
it among them, which at first frightened them, but, when it
burst, made such havoc among them that they cried out in a
hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians who were in
the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the renado,
except two or three more who pressed to the door w ich the
boatswain and'two more kept, with their bayouets on the muz-
zles of their pieces, and dispatched all that came in their way ;
but there was another apartment in the house, where the prince
or king, or whatever he was, and several others, were; and
these were kept in till the house, which was by this time all
in a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered
together. '

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not
waken the people faster than they could master them ; but
the fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows
were glad to keep a little together in bodies ; for thefire grew
so raging, all the houses being made of light combustible stuff,
that they could hardl bear the street between them : and
their business was to allow the fire, for the surer execution.
As fast as the fire either forced the eople out of those houses
which were burning, or frightened t em out of others, our peo-
ple were ready at their doors to knock them on the head, still
calling and hallooing one to another to remember Tom Jeffry.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy,
and especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it
being night, seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the cap-
tain, who was roused by his men, seeing such a fire, was ve un-
easy, not knowing what the matter was, or what danger was
in, especiall hearing the guns too, for by this time they be-
gan to use t eir firearms; a thousand thoughts op ressed his
mind concerning me and the supercargo, what wou d become
of us ; and at last, though he could ill s are any more men, et
not knowing what exigence we might e in, he takes anot er
boat, and With thirteen men and himself comes ashore to me.
. He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat
with no more than two men ; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know
what was doing; for the noise continued, and the flame in-
creased ; in short, it was next to an impossibility for any men
in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had hap-
pened, or their concern for the safet of the men : in a word,
the captain told me he would go an help his men, let what
would come. I argued with him, as I did before with the
men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the in-
terest of the owners and merchants, etc, and told him I and the
two men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn
what was likely to be the event, and come back and tell him.
It was in vain to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to the
rest before : he would go, he said ; and he only wished he had
left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having
his men lost for want of help; he had rather lose the ship, the
voyage, and his life, and all ; and away he went.
was no more able to stay behind now than I was to per-
suade them not to go ; so, in .short, the captain ordered two
men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more,
leaving the Iongboat at an anchor ; and that, when they came
back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more come
after us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for
the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof
two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this mischief
on.

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of
the ground we trod on ; and being guided by the fire, we kept
no path, but went directly to the place of the flame. If t e
noise of the guns was surprising to us before, the cries of the

oor people were now quite of another nature, and filled us with

orror. I must confess I was never at the sacking a city, or
at the takin a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Crom-
well taking rogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and
child ; and I had read of Count Till sacking the city of Mag-
debourg, and cutting the throats o twent -two thousand, of
all sexes ; but I never had an idea of the t ing itself before,
nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upon
our minds at hear-incr it. However, we went on, and at length
came to the town, though there was no entering the streets of
it for the fire. The first object we met with was the ruins of
a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house was con-
sumed; and just before it, plainly now to be seen by the light
of the fire, lay four men and three women killed, and, as we
thought, one or two more lay in the heap among the fire ; in
short, there were such instances of rage, altogether barbarous,
and of afury something beyond what was human, that we
thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it ; if they
were the authors of it, we thought the on ht to be every one
of them ut to the worst of deaths. at t is was not all : we
saw the re increased forward, and the cry went on just as the
fire went on ; so that we were in the utmost confusion. We
advanced a little way further, and behold, to our astonishment,
three naked women, and crying in a most dreadful manner,
came flying as if they had wings, and after them sixteen or
seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and consternation,
with three of our En lish butchers in the rear, who, when
they could not overta e them, fired in among them, and one
that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight. Vt'hen
the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we
would murder them as well as those that pursued them, they
set up a most dreadful shriek, es ecially the women ; and two
of them fell down, as if already dead, with the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in
my veins, when I saw this ; and I believe, had the three Eng-
lish sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our
men kill them all ; however we took some means to let the
poor flyin creatures know that we would not hurt them ; and
immediate y they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their
hands lifted up, made piteous lamentations to us to save them,
which we let them know we would ; whereupon they cre t to-
gether in a huddle close behind us, as for protection. left
my men drawn up together, and, charging them to hurt nobody,
but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and see what
devil it was possessed them, and what the intended to do,
and to command them of ; assuring them t at if they stayed
till daylight they would have a hundred thousand men about
their ears: I say I left them, and went among those flying
people, taking only two of our men with me ; and there was,
indeed, a piteous s ectacle among them. Some of them had
their feet terribly urned with trampling and running through
the fire; others their hands burned; one of the women had
fallen down in the fire, and was very much burned before she
could get out again; and two or three of the men had cuts
in their backs and thighs, from our men pursuin ; and an-
other was shot through the body, and died while was there.

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was;
but I could not understand one word they said ; though, by
signs, I perceived some of them knew not what was the occa-
sion themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this out-
rageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to
my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town,
through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an
end to it, cost what it would ; accordingly, as I came back to
my men, I told them my resolution, and commanded them to
PS0 low me, when, at the very moment, came four of our men,
with the boatswain at their heads, roving over heaps of
bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if
they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed
to them as loud as they could halloo ; and with much ado one
of them made them hear, so that they knew who we were,
and came up to us.

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come ;
and, without waiting to hear me, " Captain," says he, " noble
ca tain l I am lad you are come ; we have not half done yet.
Vi lainous, hellfiiound dogs ! I'll kill as'many of them as poor
Tom has hairs upon his head : we have sworn to spare none of
them ; we'll root out the very nation of them from the eart ."
And thus he ran on, out of breath, too, with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word.

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little,
" Barbarous dog! " said I, " what are you doing? I won't
have one creature touched more, upon pain of death: I charge
you, upon (your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or
you are a ead man this minute." " Why, sir," sa s he, " do
you know what you do, or what they have done ? f you want
a reason for what we have done, come hither." And with that
he showed me the poor fellow hanging, with his throat cut.

I confess I was urged then in se f, and at another time
would have been forward enoug ; but I thought they had
carried their rage too far, and remembered Jacob's words to
his sons Simeon and Levi: " Cursed be their anger, for it was
fierce ; and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I had now a
new task upon my hands ; for when the men I carried with me
saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain
them as I should have had with the others ; nay, my nephew
himself fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing, that
he was on] concerned for fear of the men being ove owered ;
and as to t e eople, he thought not one of them oug it to live;
for they had a l lutted themselves with the murder of the cor
man, and that t ey ought to be used like murderers. pon
these words, away ran eight of my men, with the boatswain
and his crew, to complete their bloody work ; and I, seeing it
quite out of my power to restrain them, came away pensive
and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much less the horrible
noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and
two men, and with these walked back to the boat. It was a
very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as
it were alone ; for as it began now to be almost day, and the
alarm had run over the country, there stood about forty men
armed with lances and bows, at the little place where the
twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned before ; but by ac-
cident I missed the place, and came directly to the seaside;
and by the time I got to the seaside, it was broad day : im-
mediately I took the pinnace and went on board, and sent her
back'to assist the men in what mi ht happen.

I observed, about the time that came to the boatside, that
the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated ; but in
about half an hour after I got on board, I heard a volley of
our men's firearms, and saw a great smoke 3 this, as I under-
stood afterwards, was our men fallincr upon the men who, as
I said, stood at the few houses on t e way, of whom they
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all the houses on fire, but
did not meddle with the women or children.

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace,
our men began to appear ; they came dropping in, not in two
bodies as they went, but straggling here and there in such a
manner, that a small force of resolute men might have cut them
all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole country ;
and the men were surprised, and so fri htened, that I believe
a hundred of them would have fled at t 1e sight of but five of
our men ; nor in all this terrible action was there a man that
made any considerable defense; they were so sur rised be-
tween the terror of the fire and the sudden attack 0 our men
in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves ;
for if they fled one way, they were met by one party; if back
again, by another ; so that they were everywhere knocked
down ; nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except
one that sprained his foot, and another that had one of his
hands burned.

I was very angry with my nephew the captain, and indeed
with all the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as
well for his acting so out of his duty as commander of the
ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his
prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his blind men, in
so bloody and cruel an enterprise. M ne hew answered me
very respectfully, but told me that w en e saw the body of
the poor seaman whom they had murdered in so cruel and
barbarous a manner, he was not master of himself, neither
could he govern his passion: he oWned he should not have
done so, as he was commander of the shi ; but as he was a
man, and nature moved him, he could not ear it. As for the
rest of the men, they were not subject to me at all, and they
knew it well enough ; so they took no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number they had killed ;
but according to the best of their accounts, put all together,
they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty people
--men, women, and children, and left not a house standing in
the town. As for the poor fellow Tom J eEr , as he was quite
dead (for his throat was so cut that his hea was half off), it
would do him no service to bringlhim away ; so they only took
him down from the tree where e was hanging b one hand.

However just our men thought this action, was against
them in it, and I always after that time told them God would
blast the voyage ; for I looked upon all the blood they shed
that night to be murder in them. For though it is true that
the had killed Tom'Jeifry, yet J eifry was the aggressor, had
bro en the truce, and had violated a young woman of theirs,
who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the
public capitulation.

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were after-
wards on board. He said it was true that we seemed to break
the truce, but really had not; and that the war was begun
the night before by the natives themselves, who had shot at
us and killed one of our men without any just provocation ;
so that, as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we might
also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an
extraordinary manner; that though the poor man had taken
a little libert with the wench, he ougit not to have been
murdered, an that in such a villainous manner ; and that the
did nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God a -
lowed to be done to murderers.

One would think this should have been enough to have
warned us against going on shore amongst heathens and bar-
barians; but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at
their own expense ; and their experience seems to be always
of most use to them when it is dearest bought.

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence
to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the
chief of the supercargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal;
where, if he missed his business outward-bound, he was to go
up to China, and return to the coast as he came home.

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia,
where five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian
side of the gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either
all killed or carried away into slavery ; the rest of the boat's
crew were not able to rescue them, and had but just time to get
ofi their boat. I began to upbraid them- with the just retri-
bution of Heaven in this case ; but the boatswain very warml
told me he thought I went farther in my censures than
could show an warrant for in Scripture; and referred to
Luke xiii, 4, w ere our Saviour intimates that those men on'
whom the Tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the
Galileans : but that which put me to silence in the case was,
that not one of these five men who were now lost were of those
who went on shore to the massacre of Madagascar--so I al-
ways called it, though our men could not bear to hear the word
massacre with any patience.

But my frequent reaching to them on this subject had
worse consequences t an I expected ; and the boatswain, who
had been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one
time. and told me he found that I brought that aifair contin-
ually upon the stage ; that I made unjust reflections upon it, and
had used the men very ill on that account, and himself in par-
ticular ; that as I was but a passenger, and had no command
in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged
to bear it; that they did not know but I might have some ill
design in my head, and perhaps to call them to an account for it
when they came to En land ; and that, therefore, unless I
would resolve to have one with it, and also not to concern
myself any farther with him, or an of his afiairs, he would
leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with me
among them.

I heard him atientl enough till he had done, and then told
him that I con eased I ad all along opposed the massacre of
Madagascar, and that'I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind
freely about it, though not more upon him than any of the
rest; that as to having no command in the ship, that was
true ; nor did I exercise any authorit , only took the liberty
of speaking my mind in things whic publicly concerned us
all ; and what concern I had in the voyage was none at his
business; that I was a considerable owner in the ship. In
that claim, I conceived I had a right to speak even farther
than I had done, and would not be accountable to him or any
one else, and began to be a little warm with him. He made
but little reply to me at that time, and I thought the afiair
had been over. We were at this time in the road at Bengal ;
and being willing to see the place, I went on shore with the
supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself ; and towards
evening was preparing to go on board, when one of the men
came to me and told me he would not have me trouble myself
to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me
on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I
was in at so insolent a message ; and I asked the man, who
bade him deliver that message to me. He told me the cox-
swain. I said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them
know he had delivered his message, and that I had given him
no answer to it.

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told
him the story, adding, what I presently foresaw, that there
would be a mutiny in the ship ; and entreated him to go im-
mediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint
the ca tain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence,
for be ore I had spoken to him on shore, the matter was efiected
on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all
the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone ed in the boat, came
up, and desired to speak with the captain ; and there the boat-
swain, making a long harangue, and repeating all he had said
to me, told the captain in a few words, that as Iwas n0w gone
peaceably on shore, they were loath to use any violence with
me, which, if I had not gone on shore, they would otherwise
have done, to oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought
fit to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to serve in the
ship under his command, t ey would perform it well and faith-
fully ; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige
me to quit it, they would all leave the shi , and sail no farther
with him ; and at that word all, he turne his face toward the
mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed on between
them, at which the seamen, being got together there, cried out,
" One and all! one and all I " -

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit and of great
presence of mind ; and though he was surprised, you may be
sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would con-
sider of the matter; but that he could do nothing in it till he
had spoken to me about it. He used some arguments with
them, to show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the
thing; but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands
round before his face, that they would all go on shore, unless
he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any more
on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation
to me, and did not know how I might take it; so he began to
talk smartly to them ; told them that I was a very considerable
owner of the ship, and that, in justice, he could not put me out
of my own house; that this was next door to serving me as
the famous pirate Kidd had done, who made a mutiny in the
ship, set the captain on shore on an uninhabited island, and
ran awa with the ship; that let them go into what ship they
would, ' ever the came to England again, it would cost them
very dear ; that t e ship] was mine, and that he could not put
me out of it ; and that e would rather lose the ship, and the
voyage too, than disoblige me so much; so they might do as
they pleased. However, he would go on shore and talk with
me, and invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps
they might accommodate the matter with me. But they all
rejected the proposal, and said they would have nothin to do
with me any more; and if I came on board, they woul all go
ashore. " Well," said the captain, "if you are all of this
mind, let me 0 on shore and talk with him." So away he
came to me With this account, a little after the message had
been brought to me from the coxswain.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess: for I
was not wit out apprehensions that they would confine him
by violence, set sail, and run away with the ship ; and then I
had been stripped naked in a remote country, having nothing
to help myself 3 in short,I had been in a worse case than
when I was alone in the island. But they had not come to
that length, it seems, to my satisfaction ; and when my nephew
told me what they had said to him, and how they had sworn
and shook hands, that they would, one and all, leave the ship
if I was sufiered to come on board, I told him he should not
be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore. I only
desired he would take care and send me all my necessar
things on shore, and leave me a suficient sum of money, and
would find my way to England as well as I could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my ne hew, but there
was no way to help it but to comply ; so, in s ort, he went on
board the ship again, and satished the men that his uncle
had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his goods
from on board the ship ; so that the matter was over in a few
hours, the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider
what course I should steer.

I was now alone in the most remote part of the world, as I
think I may call it, for I was near three thousand leagues by
sea farther off from En land than I was at my island; only, it
is true,I might travel ere by land over the Great Mogul's
country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up
the Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the
desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon: from thence by
sea again to Italy, and so overland into France; and this, put
together, might at least be a full diameter of the globe or more.

had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the
island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England.
But as I came hither Without any concern with the East India
Company, so it would be diflicu t to go from hence without
their license, unless with 'great favor of the captains of the
ships, or the company's factors; and to both I was an utter
stranger.

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without
me ; a treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances scarcely
ever met with, exce t from pirates running away with a ship,
and setting those t at would not agree With their villainy on
shore. Indeed, this was next door to it both ways; however,
my nephew left me two servants, or rather, one companion and
one servant ; the first was clerk to the parser, whom he engaged
to go with me, and the other was his own servant. I took me
also a good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where
several merchants 10d ed, some French, two Italians, or rather
Jews, and one Englis man. Here I was handsomely enough
entertained ; and that I might not be said to run rashly upon
anything, I stayed here above nine months, considering what
course to take, and how to manage myself. I had some Eng-
lish goods with me of value, and a considerable sum ofmone ;
my ne hew furnishin me with a thousand pieces-of-eig t,
and a etter of credit or more, if I had occasion, that I might
not be straitened, whatever might happen.

I quickly dis osed of my code to advantage; and, as I
originally mten ed, I bought ere some very good diamonds,
which, of all other things, were the most proper for me in my
present circumstances, because I could always carry my whole
estate about me.

After a lon stay here, and many proposals made for my
return to Eng and, but none falling out to my mind, the Eng-
lish merchant who lodged with me, and whom I had contracted
an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one morning :
" Countryman," says he, " I have a roject to communicate to
you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know,
suit with ours also, when you shall have thoroughly consid-
ered it. ere we are tposted, you by accident, and I by my
own choice, in a part 0 the world very remote from our own
country ; but it 18 in a country where, by us, who understand
trade and business, a reat deal of money is to be got. If you
will ut on'e thousan ounds to my one thousand pounds, we
will fire a ship here, t Ie first we can get to our minds ; you
shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we'll go a trading voy-
age to China ; for what should we stand still for ? The whole
world is in motion, rolling round and round ; all the creatures
of God, heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent;
why should we be idle? There are no drones 1n the world but
men : why should we be of that number?"

I liked this proposal very well ; and the more so because it
seemed to be expressed with so much good will, and in so
friendly a manner. I will not say but that I might, by my
loose, unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a pro-
posal for trade, or, indeed, anythin else ; otherwise, trade was
none of my element. However, might perhaps say with
some truth, that if trade was not my element, rambling was ;
and no pro osal for seeing any part of the world whic I had
never seen efore could possibly come amiss to me.

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to our
minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get
English sailors ; that is to say, so many as were necessary to
govern the voya e and manage the sailors which we should
pick up there. gfter some time we got a mate, a boatswain,
and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three fore-
mast men. With these we found we could do well enough,
having Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up.

There are so many travelers who have written a isto of
their voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little
diversion to anybody to give a long account of the places
we went to, and the people who inhabit there ; these things I
leave to others, and refer the reader to those journals and trav-
els of Englishmen, of which many, I find, are published, and
more promised every day ; it is enough for me to tell you that
we made this voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares
for opium and some arrack; the first a commodity which
bears a great price among the Chinese, and which, at that time,
was much wanted there. In a word, we went up to Suskan,
made a very great voyage, were eight months out, and re-
turned to Bengal ; and I was very well satisfied with m ad-
venture. I observe that our people in En land often adymire
how oflicers, which the Company send into ndia, and the mer-
chants which generally stay there, get such very great estates
as they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty or seventy
thousand pounds at a time ; but it is no wonder, or at least
we shall see so much farther into it, when we consider the in-
numerable orts and places where they have a free commerce,
that it will e none ; and much less it will be so when we con-
sider that at those places and ports where the Ennrlish ships
come, there is such great and constant demands for the growth
of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for the re-
turns, as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much
money by my first adventure, and such an insight into the
method of getting more, that had I been twenty years ounger,
I should have been tempted to have stayed here, an sought
no farther for making any fortune ; but what was all this to a
man upwards of threeseore, that was rich enough, and came
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the
world than a covetous desire of gainin by it? And, indeed,
I think it is with gIreat justice I now ca 1 it restless desire, for
it was so. When was at home, I was restless to go abroad ;
and when I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say,
what was this gain to me ? I was rich enough already, nor
had I any uneasy desires about getting more money; and
therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of no great force
for the prompting me forward to farther undertakings: hence,
I thoug it that by this voya e I had made no progress at all,
because I was come back, asI might call it, to the place from
whence I came, as to a home : whereas, my eye, like that which
Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied With seeing. I was
come into a part of the world which I was never in before,
and that part, in particular, which I had heard much of and was
resolved to see as much of it as I could : and then I thought
I might say I had seen all the world that was worth seeing.

But my fellow-traveler and I had diflerent notions; I do
not name this to insist on my own, for I acknowledge his
were the most just, and the more suited to the end of a mer-
chant's life : who, when he is abroad upon adventures, is wise to
stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is likely to get
the most moneyby. My new friend kept himself to the nature
of the thing, and would have been contentto have gone, like a
carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backward and forward,
provided he could, as he called it, find his account in it. On
the other hand, mine was the motion of a mad, rambling boy,
that never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not
all : I had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home,
and yet the most unsettled resolution] imaginable which way to
go. In the interval of these consultations, my friend, who
was always upon the search for business, progpsed another
voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to ring home a
loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; places,
indeed, where the Dutch trade, but islands belonging part] to
the Spaniards ; though we went not so far, but to some ot er,
where they have not the whole power, as they have at Batavia,
Ce 'lon, etc.

Ve were not long in preparing for this voyage ; the chief
difficulty was in bringing me to come into it; however, at
last, nothing. else offering, and finding that reall stirring
about and trading, the profit being so great, and, as may say,
certain, had more pleasure in it, and had more satisfaction to
my mind than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the
unhappiest part of 1i e, I resolved on this voyage too, which
we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and several
islands whose names I do not remember, and came home in
about five months. We sold our spices, which were chiefly
cloves and nutme s, to the Persian merchants, who carried
them away to the nlf ; and making near five of one, we really
got a great deal of money.

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me :
" Well now," said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my
indolent temper, "is not this better than walking' about here,
like a man wrth nothing to do, and spending our time in star-
ing at the nonsense and ignorance of the pagans?" "Why,
truly," says I, "my friend, I think it is, and I be in to be a
convert to the principles of merchandising; but must tell
you," said I, " by the way, you do not know what I am doing;
for if I once conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily,
as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I
tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly I shall never let you
lie still."

But, to be short with my speculations, a little while after
this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a
coaster, not an European trader, of about two hundred tons
burden; the men, as they pretended, having been so sickly
that the ca tain had not hands enough to go to sea with, he
lay by at engal ; and having, it seems, ot money enough,
or being willing, for other reasons, to 0 or Europe, he gave

ublic notice he would sell his ship. l'his came to my ears
liefore my new partner heard of it, and I had a rent mind to
buy it ; so I went to him and I told him of it. e considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but musing some
time, he replied, " She is a little too big ; but, however, we will
have her." Accordingl , we bought the ship, and agreeing
with the master, we psi for her, and took possession. When
we had done so, we resolved to engage the men, if we could,
to join with those we had, for the ursuing our business ; but,
on a sudden, they having receive , not their wages, but their
share of the money, as we afterwards learned, not one of them
was to be found ; we inquired much about them, and at length
were told that they were all gone together by land to Agra,
the great city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence to
travel to Surat, and go by sea to the Gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while, as that I
should miss the opportunity of going with them ; for such a ram-
ble, I thought, and in such company as would both have guarded
and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my great
design ; and I should have both seen the world, and one
homeward too; but I was much better satisfied a few a'ys
after, when I came to know what sort of fellows they were ; for,
in short, their history was, that this man they called captain was
the gunner only, not the commander; that they had been a
trading voyage, in which the had been attacked on shore by
some of the Malays, who ha killed the captain and three of
his men; and that, after the captain was killed, these men,
eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the ship,
which they did, and brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate
and five men more on shore.

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came
honestly by her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess,
examine into things so exactly as we ought ; for we never in-
quired an thing of the seamen, who would certainly have fal-
tered in t eir account, contradicted one another, and erhaps
contradicted themselves; somehow or other we sbou d have
had reason to have suspected them; but the man showed us
a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or
some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and called
himself by that name, and- we could not contradict him ; and
withal, having no suspicion of the thing, we went through
with our bargain.

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and
some Dutch ; and now we resolved on a second voyage to the
southeast for cloves, etc. ; that is to say, among the Philip-
pine and Molucca isles ; and, in short, not to fill up this part
of my story with trifles, when what is to come is so remark-
able, I spent, from first to last, six years in this country, trad-
ing from part to port, backward and forward, and with very
good success, and was now the last year with my new partner,
going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to China, but

esirmg first to go to Siam, to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up
and down a great while in the Straits of Malacca, and among
the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those dificult seas,
than we found our ship had 3 rung a leak, and we were not
able, by all our industry, to fin out where it was. This forced
us to make some port ; and my partner, who knew the country
better than I did, directed the ca tain to put into the river of
Cambodia ; for I had made the nglish mate, one Mr. Thomp-
son, captain, not being willing to take the charge of the ship
upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the great
bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and
50mg often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me one

ay an Englishman, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on
board an English East India ship, which rode in the same river,
at or near the cit of Cambodia. What brought him hither,
we knew not; at he comes to me, and speaking English,
" Sir," says he, "you are a stranger to me, and I to you ; but
I have somethin to tell you that ve nearly concerns you."

I looked stea fastly at him a goo while, and thought at
first I had known him ; butI did- not. "If it very nearly con-
cerns me," said I, " and not ourself, what moves you to tell
it to me ? " " I am moved,' says he, " by the imminent dan-
ger you are in, and, for anght I see, you have no know-
ledge of it." " I know no danger I am in," says I, " but that
my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out ; but I intend to la
her aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it." " But, sir, '
says he, " leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it, you will be
wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, when ou hear
what I have to say to you. Do you know, sir," said 1e, " the
town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river; and
there are two large English shi 3 about five leagues on this
side, and three Dutch ?" " Wel ," said I, " and what is that to
me ? " " Why, sir," said he, "is it for a man that is upon such
adventures as you are to come into a port, and not examine
first what ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal
with them ? I suppose you do not think you are a match for
them?" I was amused very much at his discourse, but not
amazed at it, for I could not conceive what he meant; and I
turned short upon him, and said : " Sir, I wish you would ex-
plain yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be
afraid of any of the Company's ships, or Dutch ships. I am
no interloper. \Vhat can they have to say to me ? " He
looked like a man half angry and half-pleased, and ausing
awhile, but smiling, " Well, sir," says he, "if you thin your-
self secure, you must take your chance ; I am sorry your fate
should blind you against good advice ; but assure yourself, if
you do not put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide
e attacked by five longboals full of men, and perhaps, if on
are taken, you will be han ed for a pirate, and the particu ars
be examined afterwards. thought, sir," added he, " I should
have met with a better reception than this for doing you a
piece of service of such importance." "I can never be un-
grateful," said I, " for any service, or to any man that ofiers
me any kindness; but it is past my comprehension what they
should have such a design upon me for ; however, since you
say there is no time to be lost, and that there is some villainous
design on hand against me, I will go on board this minute, and
put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it; but, sir," said I, "shall I go
away ignorant of the cause of all this? Can you ive me no
further light into it '1'" " I can tell you but part 0 the story
sir," says he ; " but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and
I believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest, thou h
there is scarce time for it. The short of the story is this--t 1c
first part of which I suppose you know well enough--that you
were with this ship at Sumatra ; that there your captain
was murdered by the Malays, with three of his men ; and that
you, or some of those that were on board With you, ran away
with the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is the sumCnuso: \VAnxan 09 ms Dunn--Pace 386.
of the story, and you will all be seized as pirates, I can as-
sure you, and executed with very little ceremony; for you
know merchant ships show butlittle law to pirates, if the et
them into their power." "Now you speak plain Eng isi,"
said I, " and I thank you ; and though know nothing that
we have done like what you talk of, for I am sure we came
honestly and fairly by the ship, yet seeing such a work is do-
ing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will be
upon my guard." " Nay, sir," says he, " do not talk of being
you your guard ; the best defense is, to be out of the danger.

you have any regard for your life, and the lives of all our
men, put to sea wit out fail at high water ; and as you ave
a whole tide before you, you will be gone too far out before
the can come down ; for they will come away at high water,
an as they have twenty miles to come, you will get near two
hours of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the
length of the way; besides, as they are only boats, and not
shi s, they will not venture to follow you far out to sea, espe-
cia ly if it blows." " Well," said I, " you have been very kind
in this: what shall I do for you to make you amends 1' "
"Sir," says he, "you may not be willing to make me any
amends because ou may not be convinced of the truth of it.
I will make an 0 er to you : I have nineteen months' pay due
to me on board the ship --,whichI came out of England in ;
and the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' pay due
to him. If you will make good our pay to us, we will go along
with you ; if you find nothing more in it, we will desire no
more; but if we do convince you that we have saved your
lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will
leave the rest to you."

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board,
and the two men with me. As soon as 1 came to the ship's
side, my artner, who was on board, came out on the uarter--
deck, an called to me, with a great deal of joy, " h, ho!
Oh, ho I we have stop ed the leak--we have stopped the leak !"
" Say you so ? " said Pg" thank God ! but wei h anchor, then,
immediately." " Weigh! " says he ; " what 0 you mean by
that? What is the matter?" "Ask no questions," said I ;
" but all hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute."
He was surprised ; hut, however, 1e called the ca tain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up ; an though the
tide was not quite down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we
stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told
him the story; and we called in the men, and they told us
the rest of it ; but as it took up a great deal of time, before
we had done, a seaman comes to the cabin door and called out
to us that the captain bade him tell us we were chased.
" Chased ! " says I ; " by what?" " By five sloops, or boats,"
says the fellow, "full of men." "Very well," said I, "then
it is ap areut there is somethin in it." In the next place, I
ordere all our men to be calle up. and told them that there
was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates, and
asked them if they would stand by us, and by one another;
the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would
live and die with us. Then I asked the ca tain what way he
thought best for us to manage a fight wit) them; for resist
them I was resolved we would, and that to the last drop.
He said readily, that the way was to keep them off with our
great shot as long as we could, and then to fire at them with
our small-arms, to keep them from boarding us; but when
neither of these would do any longer, we would retire to our
close quarters ; perhaps they had not materials to break open
our bulkheads, or get in upon us.

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring two guns
to bear fore and aft, out of the steel-age, to clear the deck, and
load them with musket-bullets and small pieces of old iron, and
what came next to hand ; and thus we made ready for fight ;
but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind enough, and
could see the boats at a distance, bein five large longboats,
following us with all the sail they coul make. '

Two of these boats which by our glasses we could see were
English) had outsaile the rest, were near two leagues ahead
of them, and gained upon us considerably, so that we found
they would come up with us ; upon which we fired a gun with-
out ball, to intimate that they should bring'to ; and we put
out a flag of truce, as a signal for arle ; but they came
crowding after us, till they came wit in s not, when we took
in our w rite flag, they liavin made no answer to it, and hung
out a red flag, and fired at t em with a shot. Notwithstand-
ing this, they came on till they were near enough to call to them
with a speaking-trumpet which we had on board ; so we called
to them, and bade them keep 05 at their peril.

It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavored to
come under our stern so as to board us on our quarter ; upon
which, seeing they were resolute for mischief and depended
upon the strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the
ship to, so that they lay u on our broadside; when immedi-
ately we fired five guns at them, one of which had been leveled
so true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat,
and bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail, and
running all to the head of the boat, to keep her from sinking;
so she lay by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the foremost
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in partic-
ular. While this was doing, one of the three boats that was
behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up to the
boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see
her take out the men ; we called again to the foremost boat,
and offered a truce, to parley again, and to know what her busi-
ness was with us; but had no answer, only she crowded close
under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dex-
terous fellow, ran out his two chase~guus, and fired again at
her, but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved
their caps, and came on ; the gunner, getting quickly ready
again, fired among them a second time, one shot of which,
though it missed the boat itself, yet fell in amon . the men,
and we could easil see had done a great deal of misc ief amon
them ; but we too no notice of that, wore the ship again, an
brought our quarter to hear u on them, and firing three guns
more, we found the boat was a most split to pieces ; in partic-
ular, her rudder and a piece of her stern were shot quite
away ; so they handed her sail immediately, and were in great
disorder. But, to complete their misfortune, our gunner let
fly two guns at them a sin ; where he hit them we could not
tell, but we found the oat was sinking, and some of the men
already in the water; upon this, I immediately manned out
our pinnace, which we had kept close by our side, with orders
to pick up some of the men, if they could, and save them from
drowning, and immediate] to come on board ship with them,
because we saw the rest 0 the boats began to come up. Our
men in the pinuace followed their orders, and took up three
men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a good while
before we could recover him. As soon as they were on board,
we crowded all the sail we could make, and stoodfarther out
to .sea ; and we found that when the other three boats came
up to the first two, they gave over their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I knew
not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I
apprehended, I resolved that we should change our course,
and not let any one know whither we were going : so we
stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all Euro-
pean ships, whether they were bound to China or anywhere
else, within the commerce of the European nations.

When we were at sea we began to consult with the two sea-
men, and inquire what the meaning of all this should be ; and
the Dutchman let us into the secret at once, telling us that
the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more than
a thief that had run away with her. Then he told us that the
captain, whose name too he mentioned, though I do not re-
member it now, was treacherously murdered by the natives on
the coast of Malacca, with three of his men--and that he,
this Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where they
wandered about a great while, till at length he, in particular,
in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam of to a
Dutch ship, which, sailing near the shore in its way from China,
had sent their boat on shore for fresh water: that he dnrst
not come to that part of the shore where the boat was, but
made shift in the night to take the water farther off, and swim-
ming a great while, at last the ship's boat took him up.

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship had arrived, having deserted the
rest in their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who
had run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of
pirates, who where gone a-cruising in her, and that they had
algeady taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very richly
a en.

This latter art we found to concern us directly, though we
knew itto be alse ; yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we
had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepossession
against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have de-
fended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their
hands ; and especially, considering that our accusers had been
our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned
passion have executed; and therefore it was his opinion we
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, with-
out puttin in at any port whatever; because there we could
give a 00 account of ourselves, could rove where we were
when t e ship put in, of whom we bong t her, and the like ;
and, what was more than all the rest, if we were put upon the
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we should
be sure to have some justice, and not be hanged first, and judged
afterwards.

I was some time of m partner's o inion ; but after a little
more serious thinking.SS told him thought it was a very
great hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that
we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and that
if the alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on
every side, as well by the Dutch at Batavia as the English
elsewhere : that if we should be taken as it were running away,
we should even condemn ourselves, and there would want no
more evidence to destroy us. Ialso asked the English sailor's
opinion, who said he was of my mind, and that we should cer-
tain] be taken. This danger a little startled my partner, and
all the ship's company, and we immediately resolved to go
away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China;
and, pursuing the first design as to trade, find some way or
other to dispose of the ship, and come back in some of the
vessels of the country, such as we could get. This was ap-
proved of as the best method for our security ; and accordingly
we steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty leagues of from
the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put us to some
inconvenience ; for, first, the winds, when we came that distance
from the shore, seemed to be more steadily a ainst us, blowing
almost trade, as we call it, from the E. and .N.E., so that we
were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill rovided
with victuals for so lon a run; and, what was stil worse,
there was some danger t at those English and Dutch ships,
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound that way,
might have got in before us, and if not, some other shi bound
to China might have information of us from them, an pursue
us with the same vigor. .

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself,
including the late escape from the longboats, to have been in
the most dangerous condition that ever I was in through all
my past life ; for whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I
was never pursued for a thief before ; nor had I ever done
anything that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent,
much less thievish ; I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, 331
may lightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my own; but
now I was embarrassed in the worst condition ima inable;
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no con ition to
make that innocence appear ; and if I had been taken, it had
been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind--at least, a
crime esteemed so among the people I had to do with. This
made me very anxious to make an esca e, though which way
to do it I knew not, or what port or p ace we should go to.
My partner seeing me thus dejected, though he was the most
concerned at first, began to encourage me, and describing to
me the several ports of that coast, told me he would put in on
the coast of Cochin China, or the Bay of 'l'onquin, intending
afterwards to o to Macao, a town once in possession of the
Portu uese, and where still a great many European families
reside , and particularly the missionary priests usually went
thither in order to their going forward to China.

Hither, then, we resolved to go ; and accordingly, though
after a tedious and irregular course, and very much straitened
for provisions, we came within sight of the coast very early in
the morning ; and upon reflection on the past circumstances
we were in, and the danger if we had not escaped, we resolved
to put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of
water for us, and to see if we could, either overland or by the
ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any port
thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance;
for though we did not immediately see any European ships in
the Bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the
bay two Dutch shi s ; and a third, without any colors s read
out, but which we elieved to be a Dutchman, passed y at
about two leagues' distance, steerin for the coast of China,
and in the afternoon went by two nglish shi s steering the
same course ; and thus we thought we saw curse ves beset with
enemies both one way and the other. The place we were in
was wild and barbarous--the eople thieves, even by occupation
or profession ; and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of
them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not how little
we had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several ways.
We were in a small river of this country, within afew leagues
of its utmost limits northward ; and by our boat we coasted
northeast, to the point of land which opens the great Bay of
Tonquin; and it was in this beating up along the shore that
we discovered we were surrounded with enemies. The people
we were among were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants
of the coast, having no correspondence with any other nation,
and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross commodities;
and it may be articularly seen that they are the most bar-
barous of any 0 the inhabitants. Among other customs, they
have this one--that if any vessel has the misfortune to be ship-
wrecked upon their coast, they presently make the men all
prisoners or slaves; and it was not long before we found a
piece of their kindness this way, on the occasion following.

I have observed above, that our shi sprung a leak at sea,
and that we could not find it out ; an it happened that, as I
have said, it was stopped unexpectedly, in t e happy minute
of our being to be seized by the Dutch and English s lips near
the Bay of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the shi so perfectly
ti ht and sound as we desired, we resolved whi e we were at
this place to lay her on shore, and take out what heavy things
we had on board, and clean her bottom, if possible, to find out
where the leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened the ship,
and brought all our guns and other movables to one side, we
tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom ;
but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her on dry
ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been ac uainted with such a
sight, came wondering down the shore to ook at us; and see-
ing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heel-
ing in towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at
work on her bottom with stages and with their boats on the
ofi-side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast away,
and lay fast on the ground; On this supposition, they all
came about us in two or three hours' time, with ten or twelve
large boats, having some of them eight, some ten men in a
boat, intendin , no doubt, to have come on board and
plundered the s rip, and if the found us there, to have carried
us awa for slaves to their king, or whatever they call him,
for we new nothing of their governor.

When they came 11 to the ship, and began to row round her,
they discovered us a 1 hard at work on the outside of the ship's
bottom and side, washing, and aving, and stop ing, as
every seafaring man knows how. hey stood for a w ile gaz-
ing at us, and we, who were a little surprised, could not im-
agine what their design was; but being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and others
to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were at work,
to defend themselves with, if there should be occasion ; and it
was no more than need--for in less than a quarter of an hour's
consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a
wreck, and that we were all at work endeavoring to save her,
or to save our lives b the he] of our boats; and when we
handed our arms into 1. e boat, they concluded, by that motion, 1
that we were endeavoring to save some of our goods : upon
this, they took it for ranted we all belon ed to them, and
away they came direct y upon our men, as i it had been in a
line of battle. '

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened,
for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to
know what they should do. I immediately called to the men
that worked upon the sta es, to slip them down, and get u
the side into the ship, and Ibade those in the boats to row roun
and come on board ; and the few who were on board worked
with all the strength and hands we had to bring the shi to
rights ; but, however, neither the men upon the stages nor t ose
in the boats could do as they were ordered before the Cochin
Chinese were upon them ; and two of their boats boarded our
longboat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a
stout, strong fellow, who, having a musket in his hand, never
offered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool, as I
thought ; but he understood his business better than I could
teach him, for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by
main force out of their. boat into ours, where, taking him by
the ears, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the
fellow died in his hands ; and, in the mean time, a Dutchman,
who stood next, took up the musket, and with the butt end of
it so laid about him, that he knocked down five of them who
attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little towards
resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless because ignorant of
their danger, began to throw themselves into the longboat,
where we had but five men in all to defend it ; however, the
following accident, which deserved our laughter, gave our men
a complete victory.

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the
ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had canlked her to
stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat,
one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with resin, tallow,
and oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work ;
and the man that attended the car enter had a great iron ladle
in his hand, with which he su plied) the men that were at work
with the hot stuff. Two of t 1e enem 's men entered the boat
just where this fellow stood, being in t e fore-sheets ; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladleful of the stufi, boiling hot,
which so burned and scalded them, being half-naked, that the
roared out like bulls, and, enraged with the fire, lea ed both
into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, " ell done,
Jack ! give them some more of it i " and stepping forward
himself, takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch-
pot, he and his man threw it among them so plentifully that,
in short, of all the men in the three boats, there was not one
that escaped being scalded and burned with it, in a most fright-
ful, pitiful manner, and made such a howling and crying that I
never heard a worse noise : for it is worth observing that,
though pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every na-
tion has a particular way of exclamation, and make a noxse as
difierent one from another as their speech. I cannot ive the
noise these creatures made a better name than how'f'in , nor
a name more proper to the tone of it ; for I never hear any-
thing more like the noise of the wolves which, as I have said,
I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc.

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not
only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger
was imminent before, but as we got this victory without any
bloodshed, except of that man the fellow killed with his naked
hands, and which I was very much concerned at ; for I was
sick of killing such oor savage wretches even though it was
in my own defense, nowin they came on errands which they
thought just, and knew no etter: and that though it may be
a just thing, because necessary (for there is no necessary wick-
edness in nature), yet I thou lit it was a sad life, when we
must be always obliged to be ki lin our fellow-creatures to pre-
serve ourselves; and, indeed, I t'ink so still; and I would
even now suflera great deal, rather than I would take away
the life even of the worst person injuring me; and I believe
all considering people, who know the value of life, would be of
my opinion, if they entered seriousl into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story. A l the while this was doin ,
my partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on boar
had with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and
having got the guns into their places again, the gunner called
to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly
among them. I called back again to him, and bid him not
offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work without him;
but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who
was on board, took care of. The enemy, was so terrified with
what they had met with in their first attack, that they would
not come on again ; and some of them who were farthest off,
seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as we suppose,
to see their mistake, and glave over the enterprise, finding it
was not as they expected. 'hus we got clear of this merry fight;
and having got some rice, and some roots and bread, with about
sixteen hogs, on board, two days before, we resolved to stay
here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it ; for we
made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next da with
rogues enough, erhaps more than our pitch-kettle wou d dis-
pose of for us. nge therefore got all our things on board the
same evening, and the next morning were ready to sail : in the
mean time, lying at anchor at some distance from the shore, we
were not so much concerned, being now in a fighting posture,
as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy had presented.
The next day, having finished/our work within board, and find-
ing our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail.
We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, for we wanted
to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the
Dutch ships that had been there ; but we durst not stand in
there, because we had seen several shi s go in, as we supposed,
but alittle before ; so we kept on N. ., towards the island of
Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or En lish
merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship in the ' ed-
iterranean is of an Algerine man-of-war.

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E., as if we
would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands ; and this we
did that we might not fall into the way of any of the European
ships ; and then we steered north, till we came to the latitude
of 22 degrees 20 minutes, by which means we made the island
of Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor, in order to
get water and fresh provisions, which the people there, who are
ve courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us with will-
ing y, and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their
agreements and bargains ; which is what we did not find among
other people, and may be owing to the remains of Christianity
which was once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protes-
tants, and is a testimony of what I have often observed, viz.,
that the Christian religion always civilizes the people and re-
forms their manners, where it is received, whether it works sav-
in%eifects upon them or no.

rom thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China
at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports
of China where our European ships usually come ; being re-
solved, if possible, not to fall into any of their hands, especially
in this country; where, as our circumstances were, we could
not fail of being entirely ruined.

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved
to put into the first trading port we should come at ; and stand-
ing in for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us with
an old Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowrng us to be a
European ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were
glad of, and took him on board ; upon which, without asking
us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in,
and sent it back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to him
about carrying us to the Gulf of Nanquin, which is the most
northern part of the coast of China. The old man said he knew
the Gulf of Nanquin very well ; but smiling, asked us what we
would do there. I toldhim we would sell our cargo and purchase
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, etc. ; and
so would return by the same course we came. He told us our
best port would have been to put in at Macao, where we could
not have failed of a market for our opium to our satisfaction,
and might for our money have purchased all sorts of China
goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which
he was very opinionated or conceited,I told him we were gen-
tlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and
see the great city of Pekin, and the famous court of the mon-
arch of China. "Why, then," says the old man, "you should
go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the sea there,
you may go up within five leagues of the great canal. This
canal is a navigable stream, which goes through the heart of
that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some
considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up
to the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred and sev-
cnty lea ues."

"Wel ," said I, "Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our
business now ; the great question is, if you can carry us up to
the city of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Pekin
afterwards?" He said he could do so very well, and that there
was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. This
gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror,
and we had much rather have met the devil, at least if he had
not come in too frightful a figure : and we depended upon it
that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no
condition to fight them ; all the ships they trade with into those
parts being of great burden, and of much greater force than
we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, "Sir,
you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch ; I suppose
they are not now at war with your nation?" "No," said I,
"that's true; but I know not what liberties men may take
when they are out of the reach of the laws of their own country."
"Why," says he, " on are no pirates! what need you fear?
They will not meddle with peaceable merchants, sure."

If I had any blood in my body that did not- fly u into my
face at that word, it was hindered by some stop in tlie vessels
appointed by nature to circulate it, for it put me into the great-
est disorder and confusion imaginable; nor was it possible for
me to conceal it so, but the old man easily perceived it.

"Sir," says he, " I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts
at my talk ; pray be pleased to go which way on think fit, and
depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can." " Why,
seignior," said I, "it is true I am a little unsettled in my reso-
lution, at this time, whither to go in particular; and I am some-
thing more so for what you said about pirates. I hope there are
no pirates in these seas. we are but in an ill condition to meet
with them, for you see we have but a small force, and are but
very weakly manned." "Oh, sir," says he, "don't be con-
cerned; I do not know that there have been any pirates in
these seas these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the Bay of Siam, about a month since ; but you may be
assured she is gone to the southward ; nor was she a ship of
any great force, or fit for the work. She was not built for a
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew that was
on board, after the captain and some of his men had been mur-
dered by the Malayans, at or near the_island of Sumatra."
" What!" said I, seeming to know nothing of the matter, "did
they murder the captain?" "No," said he, "I don't under-
stand they murdered him; but, as the afterwards ran away
with the ship, it is generally believed t at they betrayed him
into the hands of the Malayans, who did murder him, and ser-
haps they procured them to do it." "Why, then," sai I,
"they deserve death as much as if they had done it them-
selves." "Nay," says the old man, " they do deserve it; and
they_ will certainly have it, if they light upon any English or
Dutch ship; for they have all agreed together, that if the
meet that rogue, they'll give him no quarter." "But," said
to him," you say the pirate is gone out of these seas; how can
they meet with him, then?" "\Vhy, that's true," says he,
" they do say so ; but he was, as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam,
in the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were left on
shore when the ran away with her; and some English and
Dutch traders eing in the river, they were within a little of
taking him; nay," said he, "if the foremost boats had been
well seconded by the rest, the had certainly taken him; but
he, finding only two boats wit lill reach of him, tacked about,
and fired at those two, and disabled them before the others
came up, and then standing 0!? to sea, the others were not able
to follow, and so he got away; but they have all so exact a
description of the ship, that they will be sure to know her ; and
wherever they find her, they have vowed to give no quarter
either to the captain or seamen, but to hang them all up at the
yard-arm." " V hat!" said I, "will they execute them, right
or wrong? Hang them first, and judge them afterwards?"
" 0h, sir," says the old pilot, " there is no need to make a for-
mal business of it with such rogues as those ; let them tie them
back to back, and set them a diving--'tis no more than they
rigIhtly deserve."

knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could
do no harm, so that I turned short upon him. "\Vell, now,
seignior," said I, "this is the very reason why I would have
you carry us up to Nanquin, and not put back to Macao, or to
any other part of the country where the English or Dutch ships
come ; for be it known to you, seignior, those captains of the
English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent
fellows, that neither know what belongs to justice, nor how to
behave themselves as the laws of God and nature direct ; but
being proud of their ofices, and not understanding their ower,
they would act the murderers to punish robbers ; woul take
upon them to insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guilty without due inquiry ; and perhaps I ma live to bring
some of them to account for it when they may he taught how
justice is to be executed, and that no man ought to be treated
as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the crime, and
that he is the man."

With this I told him that this was the very ship they at.
tacked, and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had
with their boats, and how foolishly and cowardly they behaved.
I told him all the story of our buying the shi , and how the
Dutchmen served us. I told him the reasons had to believe
the story of killing the master by the Malayans was true, as
also the running away with the Shlp ; but it was all a fiction of
their own to suggest that the men had turned pirates, and
they ought to have been sure it was so before the ventured to
attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist tnem; addin
that they would have the blood of those men whom we killed
there in just defense to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were
very much in the right to go away to the north ; and that, if
he might advise us, it shoul be to sell the ship in China, which
we might very well do, and buy or build another in the country.
" And," said be, "though you will not get so good a ship, yet
you may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods

ack again to Bengal, or anywhere else." I told him I would
take his advice when I came to any port where I could find a
ship for my turn, or get any customer to buy this. He replied.
I should meet with customers enough for the ship at Nanquin,
and that a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go back
again ; and that he would procure me people both to buy one
and sell the other. " Well, but, seignior," said I, "as you say
they know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your
measures, be instrumental to bring some honest, innocent men
into a terrible broil, and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood ;
for wherever they find the ship they will prove the guilt upon
the men, b proving this was the ship ; and so innocent men
may proba ly be overpowered and murdered." "Why," says
the old man, " I'll find out a way to prevent that also ; for as
I know all those commanders you speak of very well, and shall
see them all as the pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights
in the thing, and et them know that they had been so much
in the wrong ; that though the people who were on board at first
mi ht run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they
had turned pirates ; and that, in particular, these were not the
men that first went off with the ship, but innocently bought
her for their trade ; and I am persuaded they will so far believe
me as at least to act more cautiously for the time to come."

While these things were passing between us, by wa of
discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in a out
thirteen days' sail came to an anchor at the southwest point
of the great Gulf of Nanquin ; where, by the way, I came by
accident to understand that two Dutch ships were gone the
length before me, and that I should certainly fall into their
hands. I consulted my partner again in this exigency, and he
was as much at a loss as I was, and would very gladly have
been safe on shore almost an where ; however, I was not in
such perplexity neither, but asked the old ilot if there was
no creek or harbor which I might put into an pursue my busi-
ness with the Chinese rivately, and be in no danger of the
enemy. He told me if would sail to the southward about
forty-two lea ues, there was a little ort called Quinchang,
where the fat iers of the mission usua ly landed from Macao,
on their progress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese,
and where no European ships ever put in ; and if I thought to
put in there, I migllit consider what farther course to take when

was on shore. e confessed, he said, it was not a place for
merchants, except that at some certain times they had a kind
of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over
thither to buy Chinese merchandises.

we all agreed to 0 back to this place; the name of the
port, as he called it, may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not
particularly remember it, having lost this, together with the
names of many other places set down in a little pocket-book,
which was spoiled by the water by an accident, which I shall
relate in its order; but this I remember, that the Chinese or
Japanese merchants we corresponded with called it by a dif-
ferent name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and
pronounced it as above, Quinchang.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we
weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shore where
we were, to get fresh water ; on both which occasions the peo-
ple of the country were very civil to us, and brought abundance
of things to sell to us ; I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea,
rice, and some fowls ; but nothing without money.

We did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary)
for five days ; but it was very much to our satisfaction ; and
I was joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot on
shore, resolving, and my artner too, that if it was possible to
dispose of ourselves and e ects any other way though not every
way to our satisfaction,we would never set one foot on board that
unha py vessel more ; and indeed, I must acknowledge, that of
all tile circumstances of life that ever I had any ex erience of,
nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as t at of being
in constant fear. Well does the Scripture say, " The fear of man
bringeth a snare ": it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely
oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief, and all the vigor
of Nature which usually supports men under other afflictions,
and is present with them in the greatest exigencies, fails them

ere.

'Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by
heightenin every danger ; representing the 'nglish and Date
captains to e men incapable of hearing reason, or ofdistinguish-
in between honest men and rogues ; or between a story cal-
cu ated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to
deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole voyage,
progress, and desi n ; for we might many ways have con-
vinced any reasona le creature that we were not pirates ; the
goods we had on board, the course we steered, our frankly
showing ourselves, and entering into such and such ports ; and
even our very manner, the force we had, the number of men,
the few arms, the little ammunition, short provisions ; all these
would have served to convince any men that we were no
pirates. The opium and other goods we had on board would
make it appear the shi had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen,
who, it was said, had t e names of all the men that were in the
ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portu-
guese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These,
and many other particular circumstances, might have made
it evident to the understanding of any commander, whose
hands we might fall into, that we were no pirates. But fear,
that blind, useless passion, worked another way, and threw us
into the vapors; it bewildered our understandings, and set
the imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things
that perhaps might never happen. \Ve first supposed, as in-
deed everybody had related to us, that the seamen on board
the English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were
so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our beat-
ing 0E their boats and escaping, that they would not give
themselves leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no, but
would execute us offhand, without giving us any room for a
defense. We reflected that there really was so much apparent
evidence before them, that they would scarce inquire after any
more ; as, first, that the ship was certainly the same, and that
some of the seamen among them knew her, and had been on
board her ; and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at
the river of Cambodia that they were coming down to examine
us, we fought their boats and fled ; so that we made no doubt
but the were as fully satisfied of our being pirates as we were
satisfie of the contrary ; and, as I often said, I know not but
I should have been apt to have taken those circumstances for
evidence, if the tables were turned, and my case was theirs:
and have made no scruple of cuttin all the crew to pieces,
without helievin , or perhaps considering, what they might
have to ofier in t eir defense.

But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions ;
and both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dream-
ing of halters and yardarms, that is to say, gibbets ; of fight-
ing, and being taken ; of killing, and being killed ; and one
night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutch-
men had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my double fist against the side of the cabin
I lay in with such a force as wounded my hand grievously, broke
my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it awaked
me out of my sleep.

Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage we might
meet with from them if we fell into their hands ; then the
stor of Amhoyna came into my head, and how the Dutch
mig it perhaps torture us, as they did our countrymen there,
and make some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess
those crimes they never were guilty of, or own themselves and
all of us to be pirates, and so they would put us to death with
a formal appearance of justice ; and that they might be tempted
to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo, which was
worth four or five thousand pounds altogether.

These things tormented me, and my partner too, night and
day; nor did we consider that the captains of ships had no
authority to act thus ; and if we had surrendered prisoners to
them, the could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us,
but woul be accountable for it when they came to their coun-
try ; this,I say, gave me no satisfaction ; for if they were to act
thus with us, what advantage would it be to us that they should
be called to an account for it? or if we were first to be mur-

c

Y=
dered, what satisfaction would it be to us to have them punished
when they came home ?

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now
had u on the vast variet of my particular circumstances ; how
hard thought it was t at I, who had spent forty years in a
life of continual difficulties, and was at last come, as it were,
to the port or haven which all the men drive at, viz., to have
rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows by my
own unhappy choice; and that I, who had escaped so many
dangers in my youth, should now come to be hanged in my
old age, and in so remote a lace, for a crime which I was not
in the least inclined to, muc less guilty of.

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in ;
and I would be considering that this seemed to me to be a
disposition of immediate Providence, and I ought to look upon
it and submit to it as such ; that although I was innocent as
to men, I was far from being innocent as to my Maker ; and
I ought to look in and examine what other crimes in my life
were most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as a retribution ; and that I ought
to submit to this just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had
pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place,
and then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions;
that I would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel
of merciless wretches in cold blood ; that it were much better
to have fallen into the hands of the savages, though I was
sure they would feast upon me when they had taken me, than
those who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman
tortures and barbarities; that in the case of the savages, I
always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and why should
I not do so now seeing it was much more dreadful, to me at
least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it
was to think of being eaten by men? for the savages, give
them their due, would not eat a man till he was killed and dead,
but these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death.
Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself
into a kind of fever with the agitation of a supposed fight;
my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged,
and I always resolved to take no quarter at their hands ; but
even, at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow u the
shi and all that was in her, and leave them but little Booty
to cast of.

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these
things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater
was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore ; and my
partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load
upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found that
he was not able to stand longer under it ; but that the Portu-
guese pilot came and took it of his back, and the hill disap-
peared, the ground before him appearing all smooth and plain :
and truly it was so; they were all like men who had a load
taken 0E their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off
my heart that it was not able any longer to bear; and as I
said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship.
When we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our
friend, got us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods, which,
by the way, was much the same ; it was a little house, or hut,
with a larger house adjoining to it, all built with canes, and
palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out pilfering
thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few in that
country: however, the magistrates allowed us a little guard,
and we had a soldier with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, who
stood sentinel at our door ; to whom we allowed a pint of rice,
and a little piece of money, about the value of threepence, per
day, so that our goods were kept very safe.

l'he fair, or mart, usually kept at this place, had been
over some time : however, we found that there were three or
four junks in the river, and two J a )anuers, I mean ships from
Japan, with goods which they had ought in China, and were
not gone away, having some Japanese merchants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to
get us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who
were in the town, and who had been there some time con-
verting the people to Christianity; but we thought they made
but poor work of it, and made them but sorry Christians when
they had done : however, that was none of our business. One
of these was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon ;
another was a Portuguese ; and the third a Genoese; but
Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very
agreeable company; the other two were more reserved,seemed
rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they came
about, viz., to talk with and insinuate themselves among the
inhabitants, wherever they had opportunity. We often ate
and drank with those men ; and though, I must confess, the
conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so
far from the true conversion required to bring heathen people
to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more
than letting them know the name of Christ, and say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which
they. understand not, and to cross themselves and the like ; yetCnusox's TALK wn-H FATHER Sworn--Page 405.
it must be confessed that the religionists, whom we call mis-
sionaries, have a firm belief that these peo 1e will be saved,
and that they are the instruments of it ; an on this account,
they undergo not only the fatigue of the voya e, and the
hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes eath itself,
and the most violent tortures, for the sake of this work.

But to return to my story: This French priest, Father
Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the
mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal seat of the Chinese em-
peror, and waited only for another priest, who was ordered to
come tohim from Macao, to go alongwith him; and we scarce
ever met together but he was invitina me to 0 that journey ;
telling me how he would show me aIl the g orious things of
that mighty empire, and, among the rest, the greatest city in
the world; "a city," said he, "that your London and our
Paris put together cannot be equal to." This was the cit of
Pekin, which, I confess, is ve1 great, and infinitely ful of

eople; but, as I looked on t ose things with difierent eyes

rom those of other men, so I shall give my opinion of them in
a few words, when I come in the course of my travels to speak
more particularly of them.

But first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with
him one day, and being ve1 merry together, I showed some
little inclination to go with lim ; and he pressed me and my
partner ver hard, and with a reat many persuasions, to
consent. " by, Father Simon,' says my partner, " should
you desire our company so much? on know we are heretics,
and you do not love us, nor cannot eep us company with any
pleasure." " 0h," says he, "you may perhaps be good
Catholics in time; 111 business here is to convert heathens,
and who knows but may convert you too?" "Very well,
Father," said I, " so you will preach to us all the way? " " I
will not be troublesome to you," says he ; "our reli ion does
not, divest us of good manners; besides, we are here like
countrymen ; and so we are, com ared to the place we are m ;
and if you are Huguenots, and a Catholic, we may all be
Christians at last ; at least we are all gentlemen, and we may
converse so, without being uneas to one another." I liked
this (part of his discourse very we 1, and it began to put me in
min of my priest that I had left in the Brazils; but this
Father Simon did not come up to his character by a great
deal ; for though Father Simon had no ap earance of a crimi-
nal levity in him, yet he had not that fund) of Christian zeal,
strict piety, and sincere affection to religion, that my other
good ecclesiastic had.

But to leave him a little, although he never left us, nor solic-
iting us to go with him; we had something else before us
at first, for we had all this while our ship and our merchandise
to dispose of, and we began to he very doubtful what we
should do, for we were now in a place of very little business ;
and once I was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam,
and the city of Nanquin ; but Providence seemed now more
visibly, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in our affairs;
and I was encouraged, from this very time, to think I should,
one way or other, get out of this entangled circumstance, and
be brought home to my own country again, though I had not
the least View of the manner. Providence, I say, began here
to clear up our way a little ; and the first thing that offered
was, our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us,
who inquired what goods we had; and, in the first place, he
bought all our 0 ium, and gave us a very good price for it;
paying us in gel by weight, some small pieces of their own
coin, and some in small wed es, of about ten or twelve ounces
each. While we were dea ing with him for our opium, it
came into my head that he might perhaps deal for t e ship,
too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him; he
shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to
him; but in a few days after he came to me, with one of the
missionary priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a
proposal to make to me, which was this: he had bought a
great quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts of
proposals made to him of buying the ship ; and that, therefore,
re had not money to pay for the ship ; but if I would let the
same men who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire
the ship to go to Japan ; and would send them from thence
to the Philippine Islands with another loading, which he
would pay the freight of before they went from Japan ; and
that at their return he would buy the shi . I began to listen
to his proposal, and so eager did my hea still run upon ram-
bling, that I could not but begin to entertain a notion of going
myself with him, and so to set sail from the Philippine Islands
away to the South Seas; accordingly, I asked the Japanese
merchant if he would not hire as to the Philippine Islands and
discharge us there. He said no, he could not do that, for
then he could not have the return of his cargo ; but he would
dischar 6 us in Japan, at the ship's return. Well, still I was for
taking rim at that proposal, and goiu myself ; but my part-
ner, wiser than myself, persuaded me rom it, representing the
dangers as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false,
cruel, and treacherous people ; likewise those of the Spaniards
at the Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous than they.
But to bring this long turn of our afiairs to a conclusion ;
the first thing we had to do was, to consult with the captain
of the shi , and with his men, and know if they were willing
to go to apan ; and while I Was doing this, the young man
whom my nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels came to me, and told me that he thought that voyage
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advan-
ta e, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that
if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a
merchant, or as I pleased to order him ; that if ever he came
to England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a
faithful account of his success, which should he as much mine
as I pleased. I was really 10th to part with him; but con-
sidering the prospect of advantage, which really was consider-
able, and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in it
as any I knew, I inclined to let him go; but I told him I
would consult my partner, and give him an answer the next
day. My partner and I discoursed about it, and my partner
made a most generous offer: " You know it has been an un-
lucky ship," said he, "and we both resolved not to go to sea in
it again ; if your steward (so he called my man) will venture
the voyage, will leave my share of the vessel to him, and
let him make the best of it ; and if we live to meet in England,
and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for one-
half of the profits of the ship's freight to us; the other shall
be his own." .

If my artner, who was no way concerned with my young
man, ma e him such an offer, I could do no less than offer
him the same ; and all the shi 's compan being willing to go
with him, we made over half t 1e ship to rim in property, and
took a writing from him, obli ing him to account for the
other, and away he went to apan. The Japan merchant
proved a very punctual, honest man to him ; protected him
at_Japan, and got him a license to come on shore, which the
Europeans in general have not lately obtained ; paid him his
freight very punctually; sent him to the Philippines, loaded
with Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own,
who, trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European
goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spices ;
and there he was not only paid his freight very well, and at a
very good price, but not being willing to sell the ship then,
the merchant furnished him goods on his own account ; and
with some money, and some spices of his own which he brought
with him, he went back to the Manillas to the Spaniards,
where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got a good
acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship, and
the governor of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, in
America, on the coast of Mexico, and gave him a license to
land here, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish
ship to Europe with all his men. He made the voyage to Aca-
pulco very happily, and there he sold his ship ; and having there
also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he
found means, somehow or other, to et to Jamaica with all his
treasure ; and about ei ht years a ter came to England, ex-
ceeding rich ; of which shall take notice in its place ; in the
meantime I return to our particular afi'aiis.

Being now to part with the shi .and ship's company, it
came before us, 0 course, to consi er what recompense we
should give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of
the desi 11 against us in the river Cambodia. The truth was,
they had done us a very considerable service, and deserved
well at our hands ; though,by the way, the were a couple of
to ues too ; for, as they believed the story 0 our being pirates,
an that we had really run awa with the ship, they came
down to us, not only to betra t e design that was formed
against us, but to go to sea wit) us as pirates ; and one of them
confessed afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going
a-roguing brought him to do it 3 however, the service they did
us was not the less, and therefore, as I had promised to be
grateful to them, I first ordered the money to be paid them
which they said was due to them on board their respective
ships ; over and above that, I gave each of them a small sum
of money in gold, which contented them very well ; then I
made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the gunner bein now
made second mate an purser; the Dutchman I made oat-
swain ; so they were both very well pleased, and proved very
serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.

We were now on shore in China: if I thought myself
banished, and remote from my own country at Bengal, where
I had many ways to get home for m mone , what could I
think of myself now, when I was gota out a t ousaud leagues
farther ofi from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of

rospect of return ? All we had for it was this, that in about
our months' time there was to be another fair at the place
where we were, and then we might be able to purchase all
sorts of the manufactures of the countr , and withal mi ht
possibl find some Chinese junks or vesse s from Tonquin t at
would e to be sold, and would carry us and our goods whither
we leased. This I liked very well, and resolved to wait;
besi es, as our particular persons were not obnoxious, soif any
English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have
an opportunity to lead our goods, and get passage to some
other place in India nearer home. Upon these hopes, we re-
solved to continue here; but, to divert ourselves, we took two
or three journeys into the country. First, we went ten
days' 'ourney to the city of Nanquin, a cit well worth seeing,
indeed ; they say it has a million of peop e in it; it is regu-
larly built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross one
another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it reat ad-
vantage. But when _I come to compare the miserab e people
of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of liv-
ing, their government, their religion, their wealth, and their
glory, as some call it, I must confess that I scarcely think it
worth my while to mention them here. It is very observable
that we wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the
ceremonies, the government, the manufactures, the commerce,
and conduct of these people; not that it is to be wondered at,
or, indeed, in the least to be regarded, but because, having a
true notion of the barbarity of those countries, the rudeness
and the ignorance thateirevail there, we do not expect to find
any such thing so faro . Otherwise, what are their buildin

to the palaces and royal buildings of Europe? What their
trade to the universal commerce of England, Holland, France,
and Spain ? What are their cities to ours for wealth, stren th,
gayety of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety ? at
are their ports, supplied with a few junks and barks, to our
navigation, our merchant fleets, our large and powerful navies?
Our city of London has more trade then half theirmighty em-
pire; one English, Dutch, or French man--of-war of eighty
guns, would be able to fight almost all the ship ing belonging
to China; but the greatness of their wealth, t eir trade, the
power of their government, and the strength of their armies,
may be a little surprising to us, because, as I have said, con-
sidering them as a barbarous nation of Pagans, little better
than savages, we did not expect such things among them; and
this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their greatness
and power is represented to us ; otherwise, it is in itself noth-
ing at all ; for what I have said of their ships may be said of
their armies and troops ; all the forces of their empire, though
,they were to bring two millions of men into the field together,
would be able to do nothin but ruin the country, and starve
themselves, if they were to esiege a strong town in Flanders,
or to fight a disciplined army ; one good line of German cuiras-
siers, or of French cavalry, might withstand all the horse of
China ; a million of their foot would not stand before one em-
battled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded,
though they were not to be one to twent in number; nay, I
do not boast if I say that thirty thousan German or English
foot and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat all
the forces of China. And so of our fortified towns, and of the
art of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns ; there
is not a fortihed town in China could hold out one month
against the batteries and attacks of an European army ; and,
at the same time, all the armies of China could never take such
a town as Dunkirk, rovided it was not starved; no, not in
a ten years' siege. ' hey had firearms, it is true, but they are
awkward and uncertain in their going ofi ; and their powder
has but little strength. Their armies are badly disciplined,
and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat ; and therefore, I
must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and
heard our people say such fine things of the power, glory, magni-
ficence, and trade of the Chinese ; because, as far as I saw,
they appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant
sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to rule
such a people ; and were not its distance inconceivably great
from Muscovy, and the Mus'covite empire in a manner as rude,
impotent, and ill overned as the , the Czar of Muscovy might
with ease drive t em all out 0 their country, and conquer
them in one campai n ; and had the Czar (who is now a grow-
ing prince) fallen t is way, instead of attacking the warlike
Swedes, and equally improved himself in the art of war, as
they say he has done, and if none of the powers of Europe had
envied or interrupted him, he might by this time have been
Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King of
Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in num-
ber. As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation,
commerce, and husbandry are very imperfect compared to the
same things in Europe ; also in their knowledge, their learning,
and in their skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward
or defective, though they have globes or s heres, and a smat-
tering of the mathematics, and think they now more than all
the world besides ; but they know little of the motions of the
heavenly bodies; and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are
their common people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think
a great dragon has assaulted it and is going to run away with
it ; and they fall a-clattering with all the drums and kettles
in the country, to fright the monster away, just as we do to
hive a swarm of bees.

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made
in all the accounts I have given of my travels, so'I shall make
no more such ; it is none of my business, nor any part of
my design; but to give an account of my own adventures
through a life of inimitable wanderings, and a long variety
of changes, which, erhaps, few that come after me will have
heard the like of ; shall therefore say very little of all the
mighty places, desert countries, and numerous people I have
yet to pass through, more than relates to my own story, and
which my concern amon them make necessary.

I was now, as near as can com ute, in the heart of China,
about thirty degrees north of theliine, for we were returned
from Nanquin. I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Pekin,
which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned
me daily to do it. At length his time of going away being
set, and the other missionary who was to go with him being
arrived from Macao, it was necessar that we should resolve
either to go, or not; so I referred 1t wholly to my partner,
and left it wholly to his choice, who at length resolved it in
the afiirmative, and we prepared for our journey. We set out
with very good advantage, as to finding the way ; for we got
leave to travel in the retlnue of one of their mandarins, a kind
of viceroy or principle magistrate in the province where the
reside, and who take great state upon t em, traveling win
great attendance, and great homaore from the people, who are
sometimes greatly impoverished my them, being obliged to
furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in
their journeys. That which I particularly observed in our
traveling with his baggage, was this, that though we received
suflicient provisions hoth for ourselves and our horses from
the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet ,we were
obliged to pay for everything we had, after the market
price of the country, and the mandarin's steward collected
it duly from us; so that our traveling in the retinue of the
mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was
not such a mighty favor in him, but was a great advantage
to him, considering there were above thirty other people
traveled in the same manner besides us, under the protection
of his retinue ; for the country furnished all the rovisions for
nothing to him, and yet he took our money for t rem.

We were twenty-five days traveling to Pekin, through a
country infinitely populous, but I think badly cultivated ; the
husbandry, the economy, and the way of living miserable,
though they boast so much of the industry of the people ; I
say miserable, if compared with our own, but not so to these
poor wretches, who know no other. The pride of the people
Is Infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
in some parts, which adds to that which I call their misery ;
and I must needs think the native savages of America live
much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they
have nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas, these are proud
and insolent, and in the main are in many parts mere beggars
and drud es; their ostentation is inexpressible; and, if the
can, they ove to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, whic i
is to the last degree ridiculous, as well as the contempt of all
the world but themselves.

I must confess I traveled more leasantly afterwards in the
deserts and vast wildernesses of rand Tartary than here, and
yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very con-
venient for travelers ; but nothing was more awkward to me
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the
midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance ; and my
friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these
occasions, to see the beggarly pride of these people. For ex-
ample, cominw by the house of a country gent eman, as Father
Simon callediiim, about ten leagues off the city of Nanquin,
we had first of all the honor to ride with the master of the house
about two miles ; the state he rode in was a perfect Don
Quixotism, bein a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit
was veryproper ora scaramouch, or merry-andrew, beingadirty
calico, with hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost
on every side ; it covered a tafiety vest, as greasy as a butcher's,
and which testified that his honor must be a most exquisite
sloven. His horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling creature,
and he had two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor
creature along ; he had a whip in his hand, and he belabored
the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the
tail ; and thus he rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants,

oing from the city to his country seat about half a league be-
ore us. We traveled on gently, but this figure of a gentle-
man rode away before us ; and as we stopped at a village about
an hour to refresh us, when we came by the countr seat of
this great man, we saw him in a little place before is door,
eating a repast. It was a kind of a garden, buthe was easy to
be seen ; and we were given to understand that the more we
looked at him the better he would be pleased. He sat under
a tree something like the palmetto, which effectually shaded
him over the head, and on the south side ; but under the tree was
placed a large umbrella, which made that partlook well enough.
'Ie sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being aheavy, cor-
puleut man, and had his meat brought him by two women slaves.
'Ie had two more, one of whom fed the squire with a spoon,
and the other held the dish with one hand, and scraped ofi
what he let fall 11 on his worship's beard and taffety vest.

Thus leaving t e poor wretch to please himself with our
looking at him, as if we admired his pomp, though we really
pitied and contemned him, we pursued our journey ; only

ather Simon had the euriosit to stay to inform himself what
dainties the country justice ad to feed on in all his state,
which he had the honor to taste of, and which was, I think,
a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and a
little bag filled with reen pepper, and another plant which
they have there somet ing like our ginger, but smelling like
musk, and tasting like mustard ; all this was put together, anda
small piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this washis worship's
re ast. Four or five servants more attended at a distance,
w 0 we supposed were to eat of the same after their master.

As for our mandarin with whom we traveled, he was re-
spected as a king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, and
attended in all his appearances with such omp, that I saw
little of him but at a distance. But this I 0 served, that there
was not a horse in his retinue but that our carrier's packhorses
in England seemed to me to look much better ; though it was
hard to judge rightly, for they were so covered with equi age,
mantles,'trappin s, etc., that we could scarce see anyt ing
but their feet and their heads as they went along.

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity
that I have given an account of- being over, I had no anxious
thoughts about me, which made this journey the pleasanter to
me ; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in passing
or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me free of the
country, as they call it--that isto say, threw me in. The place
was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it because
it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of
several people and places which I had occasion to remember,
and which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the
words were never after to be read, to my great loss, as to the
names of some of the places I touched at in this journey.-

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody With me ut the
youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me
as a servant, and w, 0 proved very trusty and diligfnt ;and my
partner had nobod with him but one servant,w owasakins-
man. As for the gortuguese pilot, he being desirous to see the
court, we bore his charges for his company, and to use him as an
interpreter, for he understood the language of the country, and
spoke good French and a little English ; and indeed this old
man was a most useful implement to us everywhere 5 for we
had not been above a week at Pekin, when he came laughin .
" Ah, Seignior Inglese," says he, "I have something to tel
will make your heart lad." " My heart glad," says I ; " what
can that be ? I don't now anythintr in this country can either
give me joy or grief to any great degree." " Yes, yes," says
the old man in broken En lish, " make on glad, me sorry."
" Why," said I, " will it ma 0 you sorry g" " Because," said
he, " you have brou ht me here twenty-five days' journey, and
will leave me to go ack alone ; and which way shall I get to
my port afterwards, without a ship, without a horse, without
pecan"v "--so he called money, being his broken Latin, of
which he had abundance to make us merry-with. In short, he
told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish
merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their journey by
land to Muscov , within four or five weeks ; and he was sure
we would take t e opportunity to go with them, and leave him
behind to go back alone.

I confess I was greatly sur rised with this good news, and
had scarce power to speak to im for some time ; but at last I
turned to him. " How do you know this ?" said I: " are you
sure it is true ? " " Yes," says he; "I met this morning in the
street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among
than He came last from Astracan, and was designing to go
to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his
mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow,
and so down the river VYolga to Astracan." " Well, Seignior,"
says I, "do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone ;
if this be a method for my return to En land, it shall be your
fault if you go back to Macao at all." Ve then went to con-
sult together what was to be done; and I asked my partner
what he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit
with his afiairs? He told me he would do just as I would;
for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his
efiects in such good hands, that as we had made a good voy-
age here, if he could invest it in China silks, wrought and
raw, such as might be worth the carriage, he would be con-
tent to go to England, and then make his voyage back to Ben-
gal by t )e Company's shi s.

Having resolved upon t is, we agreed that if our Portuguese
pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges to Moscow,
or to England, if he pleased ; nor, indeed, were we to be
esteemed over-generous in that either, if we had not rewarded
him farther, the service he had done us being really vorth
more than that ; for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea,
but he had been like a broker for us on shore 5 and his procur-
ing for us the Japan merchant was some hundreds of ounds
in our pockets. So we consulted together about it, an being
willing to gratify him, which was but doing him justice, and
very willing also to have him with us besides, for he was a
most necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a
quantity of coined gold, which, as I compute it, came to about
one hundred and seventy-five pounds sterling, between us, and
to bear all his charges, both for himself and horse, except only
a horse to carry his goods. Having settled this between our-
selves, we called him to let him know what we had resolved.
I told him he had complained of our being willing to let him
go back alone, and I was now about to tell him 'we were
resolved he should not oback at all ; that as we had resolved
to go to Europe with t e caravan, we resolved also he should
go with us ; and that we called him to know his mind. He
shook his head and said it was a long joumey, and that he had
no pecune to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when he
came there. We told him we believed it was so, and there-
fore we had resolved to do something for him that should let
him see how sensible we were of the service he had done us,
and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him
what we had resolved to give him here, which he might lay
out as we would do our own ; and that as for his charges, if
he would go with us we would set him safe on shore (life and
casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or England, which he
would, at our own charge, except'only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported, and told us
he would go with us over the whole world 5 and so we all pre-
pared for our journe . However, as it was with us so it was
with the other mere ants ; they had many things to do, and
instead of being readv in five weeks, it was four months and
some days before all things were got together.

It was the beginning of February, our st le, when we set
out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had gone ex-
press back to the ort where we had first ut in, to dis ose of
some goods whici we had left there; and I, with a 'hinese
merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nanguin, and
who came to Pekin on his own afi'airs, went to Nanqum, where
I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred
pieces of other very fine silks of several sorts, some mixed
with gold, and had all these brought to Pekin against my
partner's return ; besides this, we bought a very large quantity
of raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo amouting, in these
goods only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds ster-
ling; which, together with tea and some fine calicoes, and threeI

camels' loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen
camels for our share, besides those we rode upon ; which, with
two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with pro-
visions, made us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our
retinue.

The company was very great, and, as far as I can remember,
made between three and four hundred horse, and upwards of
one hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided
for all events ; for as the Eastern caravans are subject to be
attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but they
are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous
when they prevail.

The company consisted of people of several nations ; but there
were about sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow,
thou h of them some were Livonians; and to our particular
satis action, five of them were Scots, who appeared also to be
men of great experience in business, and of very ood substance.

. When we had traveled one day's journey, t )e guides, who
were five in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants--
that is to say, all the passengers except the servants--to a

reat council, as they called it. At this council, every one

eposited a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for
the necessary expense of bu ing forage on the way, where it
was not othermse to be ha , and for satisfying the guides,
getting horses, and the like; and here they constituted the
Journey, as they call it, viz., they named captains and oflicers
to draw us all up, and give the word of command, in case of
an attack, and give every one their turn of command; nor
was this forming us into order any more than what we found
needful on the way, as shall be observed.

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and
is full of potters and earth-makers--that is to sa , people that
temper the earth for the China ware; and as was coming
along, our Portugal pilot, who had always something or other
to say to make us merry, came sneerin to me, and told me he
would show me the greatest rarity in a l the countr , and that
I should have this to say of China, after all thei l-humored
things that I said of it, that I had seen one thing which was
not to be seen in all the world beside. I was very importunate
to know what it was ; at last he told me it was a gentleman's
house built with China ware. "Well," sa s I, "are not the
materials of their buildings the product of t eir own country ?
and so it is all China ware, is it not '3" " No, no," says he, " I
mean it is a house all made of China ware, such as you call it
in England, or as it is called in our country, porcelain."
" Well," says I, " such a thing may be. How big is it ? Can
we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we will buy it."
" U on a camel l" says the old pilot, holding up both his
han s ; " why, there is a family of thirt peo le lives in it."

I was then curious, indeed, to see it ; lint w en I came to it,
it was nothing but this : it was a timber house, or a house built,
as we call it in England, with lath and plaster ; but all this plas-
tering was really China ware--that is to say, it was plastered
with the earth that makes China ware. The outside, which
the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked very well,
perfectl white, and painted with blue figures, as the large China
ware in ngland is painted, and hard as if it had been burned.
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined
with hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we
called galley-tiles in England, all made of the finest China and
the figures exceedingly fine indeed, with extraordinary variety
of colors, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but
joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the same earth,
that it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floons of the
rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen
floors we have in use in several parts of England ; as hard as'
stone, and smooth, but not burned and painted, except some
smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with
the same tile; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the
whole house were of the same earth ; and, after all, the roof was
covered with tiles of the same, .but of a deep shining black.
This was a China ware house indeed, truly and literally to be
called so, and had I not been upon the journey, I could have
stayed some days to see and examine the particu ars of it. They
told me there were fountains and fish-pounds in the garden,all
paved on the bottom and sides with the same ; and fine statues
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain
earth, and burned whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be
allowed to excel in it ; but I am very sure they excel in their
accounts of it ; for they told me such incredible things of their
performance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in partic-
ular, of one workman that made a ship, with all its tackle, and
masts, and sails in earthenware, big enough to carry fifty men.
If they had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to
Japan in it, I might have said something to it indeed; but as
it was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, ask-
ing pardon for the word, that the fellow lied ; so I smiled and
said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for
which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of
three shillings, and told me if it had been three days' jour-
ney without the wall, as it was three days within, 0 must
have fined me four times as much, and made me ask pardon
the next council day. I promised to be more orderly; and,
indeed, I found afterwards the orders made for keeping all to-
gether were absolutely necessary for our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made
for a fortification against the Tartars ; and a very great work
it is, going over hills and mountains in a needless track, where
the rocks are impassable, and the grecipices such as no enemy
could possibly enter, or indeed c imb up, or' where, if they
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is near
a thousand English miles, but that the country is five hundred
in a straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without
measuring the windings and turnings it takes ; it is about four
fathoms high, and as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour or thereabonts without trespassing our
orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the ate), to
look at it on every side, near and far ofl', I mean w at was
within my view ; and the guide of our caravan, who had been
extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to
hear my opinion of it. I-told him it was a most excellent
thing to keep out the Tartars; which he happened not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compliment; but
the old pilot laughed," " Oh, Seignior Inglese," says he, " you
speak in colors." "In colors ! " said I, "what do on mean by
that?" "Why, you speak what looks white t liS way, and
black that way--gay one way, and dull another. You tell him
it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell me by that it
is good for nothing but to keep out '1 artars. I understand
you, Seignior Inglese, I understand you ; but Seignior Chinese
understood you his own way." " Well," says I, " seignior, do
you think it would stand out an army of our country people,
with a good train of artillery ? or our engineers, with two com~
paniesof miners? 'Vould not they batter it down in ten days,
that an army might enter in battalia? or blow it up in the air,
foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it left?"
" Ay, ay," says he, " I know that." The Chinese wanted
mightily to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him
a few days after, for we were then almost out of their country,
and he was to leave us a little time after this ; but when he knew
what I said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard
no more of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatness
while he stayed. '

After we passed this mighty nothin , called a wall, some--
thing like the Picts' wall, so famous in orthumberland, built
by the Romans, we began to find the country thinly inhabited,
and the eople rather confined to live in fortified towns or
cities,. as eing subject to the inroads and dc redations of the
Tartars, who rob in rent armies, and thereibre are not to be
resisted by the nake inhabitants of an open country. And
here I began to find the necessity of keeping together in a
caravan as we traveled, for we saw several troops of Tartars
roving about ; but when I came to see them distinctly, I won-
dered more that the Chinese Empire could be con uered by
such contemptible fellows ; for they are a mere hor e of wild
fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no discipline or
manner of fight. Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught
nothing, and fit for nothing ; and this we found the first day
we saw them, which was after we entered the wilder part of
the country. Our leader for the da gave leave for about six-
teen of us to o a-hunting as they ea 1 it; and what was this but
hunting of s eep! However, it may be called hunting, too,
for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever
I saw of their kind ; only they will not run a great way, and
you are sure of sport when you begin the chase, for they ap-
pear generally thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true sheep,
always keep together when thcfy fly.

In pursuit of this odd sort 0 game, it was our hap to meet
with about forty Tartars ; whether they were hunting mutton,
as we were, or whether they looked for another kind of prey,
we know not ; but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a
kind of horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had
never heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear again.
We all supposed this was to call their friends about them, and
so it was; for in less than ten minutes, atroop of forty or
fifty more appeared, at about a mile distance ; but our work
was over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be
amongst us, and as soon as he heard the horn, he told us that
we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately, with-
out loss of time ; and drawing us up in a line, he asked if we
were resolved. We told him we were ready to follow him ;
so we rode directly towards them. They stood gazing at us
like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor showmg the face
of any order at all 5 but as soon as they saw us advance, they
let fly their arrows, which, however, missed us, very happily :
it seems they mistook not their aim, but their distance; for
their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim,
that had we been about twenty ards nearer, we must have
had several men wounded, if not illed.

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance
we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, fol-
lowing our shot full-gallop, to fall in among them sword in
hand--for so our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, in-
deed, but a merchant, but he behaved with such vigor and
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such cool courage too,
that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As
soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces,
and then drew ; but they fled in the greatest confusion imag-
inable. The only stand any of them made was on our right,
where three of them stood, and by signs, called the rest to come
back to them, having a kind of scimitar in their hands, and
their bows hanging to their backs. Our brave commander,
without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to them,
and with his fusee knocks one of them ofi his horse, killed the
second with his pistol, and the third ran away ; and thus ended
our fight ; but we had this misfortune attending it, that all our
mutton we had in chase got away. \Ve had not a man killed
or hurt ; but as for the Tartars, there were about five of them
killed; how many were wounded we knew not; but this we
knew, that the other party were so frightened with the noise
of our guns, that they made off, and never made any attempt
upon us.

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and there-
fore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about
five days we entered a vast, great, wild desert, which held us
three days and nights' march ; and we were obliged to carry
our water with us, in great leathern bottles, and to eneamp all
night, just as I have heard they do in the desert of Arabia.

asked our uides whose dominion this was in, and they told
me this was a ind of border, that might be called no man's
land, being a part of Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary ; that,
however, it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but that
there was no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of
thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the
whole march, though we were to go over some much larger.

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful
to me, we saw, two or three times, little parties of the Tartars,
but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no
design upon us ; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them: we
let them go. V Once, however,a )art of them came so near as
to stand and gaze at us ; whet er it was to consider if they
should attack us or not, we knew not ; but when we had passed
at some distance by them, we made a rear-guard of forty men,
and stood read for them, letting the caravan pass half a mile
or thereabouts efore us ; but after awhile they marched 0E ;
only we found they saluted us with five arrows at their parting,
which wounded a horse so that it disabled him, and we left him
the next day, poor creature, in great need of a good farrier:
they might shoot more arrows, which might fall short of us ;
but we saw no more arrows or Tartars that time.

We traveled near a month after this, the ways not being so
good as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor
of China, but la for the most part in the villages, some of
which were forti ed, because of the incursions of the Tartars.
When we were come to one of these towns (it was about two
days and a half's journey before we came to the city of Naum),
I wanted to buy a came], of which there are plenty to be sold
all the way upon that road, and horses also, such as they are,
because, so many caravans coming that way, they arer'often
wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me a camel would
have gone and fetched one for me, but I, like a fool, must be
ofiicious, and go myself along with him ; the place was about
two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they kept the
camels and horses feeding, under a guard.

I walked it on foot, with my old ilot and a Chinese, being
very desirous of a little variety. hen we came to the place,
it was a low marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall,
piled u dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park,
with alittle guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Havin
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came away, an
the Chinese man that went with me led the came], when on a
sudden came up five Tartars on horseback. Two of them seized
the' fellow and took the camel from him, while the other three
stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it were, un-
armed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which
could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that
came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword, for they
are arrant cowards ; but a second, coming upon my left, gave
me a blow on the head, which I never felt till afterwards, and
wondered, when I came to myself, what was the matter, and
where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground ; but my never-
failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlocked for,
directs deliverances from dangers which to us are unforeseen),
had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the
Tartars either ; if they had, I suppose they would not have at-
tacked us, but cowards are always boldest when there is no
danger. The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laying ho.
of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down by main force
a little towards him, with the other shot him in the head, and
laid him dead upon the spot. He then immediately stepped
up to him who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could
come forward again, made ablow at him with a scimitar, which
he always wore, but missing the man, struck his horse in the
side of his head, cut one of the ears off by the root, and a great
slice down by the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged
with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow sat well enon h too, but awa he flew, and
carried him quite out of the pi ot's reach; an at some dis-
tance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and
fell upon him. ,

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the
camel, but he had no weapon ; however, seeing the Tartar down,
and his horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing
upon an ugly ill-favored weapon he had by his side, something
like a poleax, but not a poleax neither, he wrenched it from
him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with it.
But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and
seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight him,
as he apprehended, ut stood stock still, the old man stood still
too, an fell to work with his tackle to charge his pistol again ;
but, as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, away he scoured, and
left my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a complete
victory.

By this time I was a little recovered ;' for I thought, when I
first began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep ; but, as
I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the
ground, and what was the matter ; but a few moments after, as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where ; so I
clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody ; then
I felt my head ache ; and then in a moment memory returned,
and everything was present to me again. I jumped upon my
feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, but no enemies were
in View ; I found a Tartar lying dead, and his horse standing
very quietly by him ; and, looking farther, I saw my champion
and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done,
coming back with his hanger in his hand. The old man, see-
ing me on my feet, came running to me, and embraced me withCuusos Wouxoan.--Page 42%
a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I had been killed ;
and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt; but it was
not much, only what we call a broken head ; neither did I after-
wards find any great inconvenience from the blow, for it was
well again in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we lost
a camel and gained a horse. But that which was remarkable,
when we came back to the village, the man demanded to be

aid for the camel ; I disputed it, and it was brought to a bear-
lng before the Chinese judge of the place. To give him his
due, he acted with a reat deal of prudence and im artiality ;
and, having heard bot 1 sides, he gravely asked the C inese man
that went with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was?
"I am no servant," says be, "but went with the stranger."
" At whose request ? " says the justice. "At the stranger's re-
quest," says he. "Why, then," says the justice, "you were the
stranger's servant for the time ; and the camel being delivered
to his servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay for it."

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say ;
but, admiring to see such just reasoninlg upon the consequence,
and an accurate stating of the case, paid willing] for the
camel, and sent for another; but, you ma observe, did not
go to fetch it myself any more, for I had ad enough of that.

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese Empire ; they
call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there ; for this
I will venture to afiirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathay,
which, I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the
walls with their bows and arrows ; but to call it stron , if it
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those w 0 un-
derstand it laugh at you.

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this
city, when messengers were sent express to every part of the
road to tell all travelers and caravans to halt till they had a
guardsent for them 3 for that an unusual body of Tartars, mak-
ing ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty
miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travelers ; however, it was care-
fully done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we
should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had
two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on
our left, and three hundred more from the city of Naum, and
with these We advanced boldly ; the three hundred soldiers
from Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear,
and our men on each side of our camels, with our baggage,
and the whole caravan in the center; in this order, and well
prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another thing.

It was early in the morning, when marching from a well-
situated little town. called Changu, we had a river to pass,
which we were obliged to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had any
intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked us, when
the caravan being over, the rear-guard was behind ; but they
did not appear there. About three hours after, when we'were
entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, be-
hold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was at
bland : and they were at hand, indeed, for they came on upon
t e 8 ur. '

Th}; Chinese, our guard in the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger ; and the soldiers frequently
looked behind them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind ;
and bein near me, called out: "Seignior Inglese," says be,
"those fe lows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all ;
for if the Tartars come on, they will never stand it." "I am
of your mind," says I ; " but what must be done?" " Done l"
says he, "let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each
wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like brave fel-
lows in brave com any; but without this, they will every man
turn his back." mmediately, I rode up to our leader, and told
him, who was exactly of our mind ; and accordinoly fifty of
us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the leit, and the
rest made a line of rescue; and so we marched, leaving the
last two hundred men to make a body by themselves, and to
guard the camels ; only that, if need were, they should send a

undred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable com-
pau they were ; how many we could not tell, but ten thou-
san , we thought, was the least ; aparty of them came on first
and viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front of
our line; and, as we found them within gunshot, our leader
ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done ; and they
went ofi, I suppose back, to give an account of the reception
they were like to meet with : and, indeed, that salute cloyed
their stomachs, for they immediate] halted, stood a while to
consider it, and wheeling 03 to the left, they gave over their
design, and said no more to us for that time ; which was very
agreeable to our circumstances, which were but very indif-
ferent for a battle with such a number.
Two da s after, we came to the city of Naun, or Naum : we
thanked t ie governor for his care of us, and collected to the
value Of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day.
This is a garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers
kept here ; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, the Muscovites
having abandoned that part of the country, which lies from
this city west for about two hundred miles, as desolate and
unfit for use ; and more especial] being so very remote, and so
difficult to send troops thither or its defense; for we were
yet above two thousand miles from Muscovy, pro erly so called.

After this, we passed several great rivers, an two dreadful
deserts ; one of which we were sixteen days passing over, and
which, as I said, was to be called no man 5 land ; and, on the
13th of April, we came to the frontiers of the Museovite domin-
ions. I think the first town or fortress, whichever it may be
called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Ar-
guna, being on the west side of the river Arguna.

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was
so soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or, at
least, in a country governed by Christians; for though the
Muscovites do, in my opinion, but just deserve the name of
Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very devout in
their wa . It would certainly occur to any man who travels
the worl asI have done, and who had any power of reflection,
what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where the
name of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshiped;
and not where the people, given up by Heaven to strong de-
lusions, worship the devil, and rostrate themselves to stocks
and stones ; worship monsters, e ements, horrid-shaped animals,
and statues or images of monsters. Not a town or city we
passed through but had their pagodas, their idols, and their
temples, and ignorant people worshiping even the works of
their own hands, Now we came where, at least, a face of the
Christian worship appeared; where the knee was bowed to
Jesus ; and whether ignorantly ornot, yet the Christian religion
was owned, and the name of the true God was called upon and
adored ; and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the
brave Scots merchant I mentioned above with in first ac-
knowledgment of this ; and taking him by the han , I said to
him, " Blessed be God, we are once again among Christians."
He smiled and answered, " Do not rejoice too soon, country-
man, these Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians ; and
but for the name of it, you may see very little of the substance
for some months farther of our journey." " Well," says I, " but
still it is better than paganism and worshi ing of devils."
" W'hy,I will tell you," says he, "except the ussian soldiers
in the garrison, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a thousand
miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of
pagans." And so, indeed, we found it.

lVe were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth,
if I understand anything of the surface of the globe, that is to
be found in any part of the world; we had, at least, twelve
thousand miles to the sea, eastward ; two thousand to the bottom
of the Baltic Sea, westward ; and above three thousand, if we
left that sea, and went on west, to the British and French
channels: we had full five thousand miles to the Indian or
Persian Sea, south ; and about eight hundred to the Frozen
Sea, north. Nay, if some people may be believed, there might
be no sea northeast till we came round the Pole, and conse-
quently into the northwest, and so had a continent of land
into America, the Lord knows where; though I could give
some reasons why I believe that to be a mistake.

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good while
before we came to any considerable towns, we had nothing to
observe there but this : first, that all the rivers run to the east ;
as I understood by the charts, which some in our carvavan had
with' them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the great river
Yamour, or Gamour; which river, by the natural course of it,
must run into' the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The story
they tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked up with
bulrushes of a monstrous growth--viz., three feet about, and
twenty or thirty feet high--I must be allowed to say,l believe
nothing of it ; but, as its navigation is of no use, because there
is no trade that way, the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs,
dealing in nothing but cattle, so nobody that ever I heard of
has been curious enough either to go down to the mouth of it
in boats, or come up from the mouth of it in ships, as far as I
can find; but this is certain, that this river running east, in
the latitude of about 50 degrees, carries a vast concourse of
rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in that
latitude ; so we are sure of sea there.

Some. leagues to the north of this river, there are several
considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the
Yamour runs east, and these are all found to join their waters
with the great river 'l'artarus, named so from the northern-
most nations of the Mogul 'l'artars ; who, as the Chinese say,
Were the first Tartars iu the world; and who, as our geog-
raphers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred
histor . These rivers running all northward, as well as all
the ot ier rivers I am yet to s eak of, make it evident that the
Northern Ocean bounds the ands also on that side ; so that
it does not seem rational in the least to think that the land
can extend itself to join with America on that side, or that
there is not a communication between the Northern and East-
ern Ocean ; but of thisI shall sa no more; it was my observa-
tion at that time, and therefore take notice of it in this place.

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and mod-
erate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care the
Czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built in
as many places as it is possible to place them, where his soldiers
keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed by
the Romans in the remotest countries of their em ire; some
of which I had read of were placed in Britain, fort e security
of commerce, and for the lodging of travelers: and thus it
was here ; for wherever we came, though at these towns and.
stations the garrisons and governors were Russians and pro-
fessed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans; sacri-
ficing to idols, and worshiping the sun, moon, and stars, or all
the host of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all the
heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous,
except only that they did not eat men's flesh, as our savages of
America did. '

Some instances of this we met with in the country between
Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of
Tartars and Russians to ether, called Nertzinskay, in which
is a continued desert or Eorest, which cost as twenty da s to
travel over. In a village near the last of these places, had
the curiosity to o and see their way of living, which is most
brutish and insu erable. They had, I sup ose, a great sacrifice
that day ; for there stood out, n on an 01 stump of a tree, an
idol made of wood, frightful as t e devil ; at least, as anything
we can think of to represent the devil can be made ; it had a
head not resembling any creature that the world ever saw ; ears
as big as oats' horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown piece ;
a nose 1i e a crooked ram's horn, and a mouth extended four-
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a
parrot's under bill : it was dressed up in the filthiest manner
that you could suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep-skins,
with the wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the head,
with two horns growing through it : it was about eight feet
high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion of arts.

l'his scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the vil age 5
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen
creatures--whether men or women I could not tell, for they
made no distinction by their habits--all lying flat upon the
ground round this formidable block of shapeless wood ; I saw
no motion among them, any more than if they had been all logs
of wood, like the idol, and at first I really thought they had
been so ; but when I came a little nearer, they started up upon
their feet, and raised a howlin cry, as if it had been so many
deep-mouthed hounds, and wa ked away, as if they were dis-

leased at our disturbing them. A little way off from the
idol, and at the door of a tent or but, made all of sheep-skin
and cow-skins dried, stood three butchers--I thought they
were such when I came nearer to them, for I found they had
long knives in their hands ; and in the middle of the tent ap-
peared three sheep killed, and one young bullock, or steer.
I'hese, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol ;
the three men were priests belonging to it, and the seventeen
prostrated wretches were the people who brought the offering,
and were making their prayers to that stock.

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at anything in my life ;
to see God's most glorious and best creature, to whom he had
granted so many advantages, even by creation, above the rest
of the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and
that soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both
to honor his Maker and to be honored by him. sunk and degen-
erated toa degree so very stupid as to prostrate itself to a
frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed up by them-
selves and made terrible to themselves by their own contri-
vance, adorned only with clouts and rags,--and that this should
be the efiect of mere ignorance, wrought up into hellish devo-
tion by the devil himself, who, envying his Maker the homage
and adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into such sor-
did and brutish things as one would think would shock Nature
itself !

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of
thoughts? And thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and
there was no room to wonder at it, or think it impossible; all
my admiration turned to rage, and I rode up to the image or
monster--call it what you will--and with my sword made a
stroke at the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it in two ;
and one of our men that was with me took hold of the sheep-
skin that corcrcd it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a most hid-
eous outcry and howling ran through the village, and two or

hrce hundred people came about my cars, so that I was glad
to scour for it, for we saw some had some bows and arrows ;
but I resolved from that moment to visit them again.

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was
about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which
they wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded
wit the badness of the way and long march over the last
desert ; so we had some leisure here to put my design in ex-
ecution. I communicated it to the Scots merchant of Moscow,
of whose courage I had sufficient testimony ; I told him what
I had seen, and with what indignation I had since thought that
human nature could be so degenerate ; I told him if I could get
but four or five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved
to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see
that it had no power to~ help itself, and consequently could not
be an object o worship, or to be prayed to, much less help
them that offered sacrifices to it.

He laughed at me ; says he, "Your zeal may be good, but
what do you propose to yourself by it? " " Propose !" said I,
" to vindicate the honor of God, which is insulted by this devil-
worship." "But how will it vindicate the honor of God,"
said he, " while the people will not be able to know What you
mean by it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them so ?
and then they will fight on, and beat you, too, I assure you ;
for they are desperate fe lows, and that especially in defense
of their idolatry." "Can we not,". said I, "do it in the night,
and then leave them the reasons and the causes in writing in
their own language ? " " W'ritina ! " said he ; " why, there is not
a man in five nations of them t at knows anything of a letter,
or how to read a word any way." " Wretched ignorance i" said
I to him ; "however, I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps
Nature may draw inferences from it to them, to let them see
how brutish they are to worshi such horrid things." " Look
you, sir," said he ; "if your zea prompts you to it so warmly,
you must do it ; but, in the next place, I would have you con-
sider these wild nations of people are subjected by force to
the Czar of Muscovy's dominion ; and if you do this, it is ten
to one but they will come by thousands to the governor of Nert-
zinskay and demand satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them
satisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt, and it will occasion
a new war with all the Tartar-s iu the country."

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a while ;
but I harped upon the same string still ; and all that day I
was uneas to put my project in execution. Towards the even-
ing, the cots merchant met me by accident in our walk
about the town, and desired to speak with me. "I believe,"
said he, "I have (put you ofi your good design. I have been
a little concerns about it since, for I abhor idolatry as much
as you can do." "Truly," said I, "you have put off a little
the execution of 'it ; but you have not put it out of my thoughts,
and I believe I shall do it before I quit this place, though I
were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction." " No, no,"
said he ; "God forbid they should deliver you up to such a
crew of monsters l They shall not do that either ; that would
be murdering you, indeed." " Why," said I, " how would they
use me i'" " Use you ! " said he ; " I'll tell you how they served
a poor Russian who afironted them in their worship just as
you did, and whom they took prisoner, after they had lamed

im with an arrow that he could not run away. They took
him and stripped him stark naked, and set him u on the top
of the idol-monster, and stood all round him, and s ot as many
arrows into him as would stick over his whole body ; and then
they burned him, and all the arrows sticking in him, as a sac-
rifice to the idol." "And was this the same idol?" said I.
" Yes," said he, " the very same." " Well," said I, "I will tell
you a story." So I related the stor of our men at Madagascar,
and how they burned and sacked t e village there, and killed
man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of our men,
just as it is related before; and I added that I thought we
ought to do so to this village.

He listened very attentively'to the story ; but when I talked
of doing so to that village, said he, " You mistake very much ;
it was not this village--it was almost a hundred miles from
this place ; but it was the same idol, for they carry him about
in procession all over the country." " Well," said I, " then
that idol ought to be punished for it ; and it shall," said I, "if
I live this night out."

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told
me I should not go alone, but he would go with me, but he
would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his countrymen,
to go also with us; "and one," said he, "as famous for his
zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish things
as these." In a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman,
whom he called Captain Richardson ; and I gave him' a full
account of what I had seen, and also what I intended ; and he
told me readily he would go with me if it cost him his life. So
we agreed to go--onl y we three. I had, indeed, proposed it to
my partner, but he declined it. He said he was ready to as-
sist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defense ;
but this was an adventure quite out ol' his way ; so, I say, we
resolved upon our work, only we three and my manservant,:/-I

Dmnuc'rmx or THE TARTAR Inch--Page 481.
and to put it in execution that night about midnight, with all
the secrecy imaginable.

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it
till the next night, because the caravan being to set forward
in the morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to
give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his
power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for the
enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's robe or
gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with abow and arrows,
and had provided the same for himself and his countr man,
that the people, if they saw us, should not determine w 0 we
were.

All the first night we spent in mixin up some combustible
matter, with aqua vitae, gunpowder, 311% such other materials
as we could get ; and having a good quantity of tar in a little
pot, about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found
that the people had not the least jealous of danger attending
their idol. The night was cloudy ; yet t he moon gave us light
enough to see that the idol stood just in the sa e posture and
place that it did before. The people seemed to e all at their
rest ; only that in the great hut or tent, as we called it, where
we saw the three priests, whom we mistook for butchers, we
saw a light, and going up close to the door, we heard people
talking as if there were five or six of them ; we concluded,
therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, these men would
come out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it
from the destruction that we intended for it ; and what we in--
tended to do with them we_knew not. Once we thought of
carrying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance ; but when
we came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our carriage ;
so we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman was for
setting fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures that
were there on the head when they came out ; but I could not
join with that; I was against killincr them, if it were possible
to avoid it. " Well, then," says the SScots merchant," I will tell
you what we will do ; we will try to make them prisoners, tie
their hands, and make them stand and see their idol destroyed."

As it happened, we had twine or pack-thread enough about
us, which we used to tie our firelocks together with ; so we re-
solved to attack these people first, and with as little noise as
we could. The first thing we did we knocked at the door,
when one of the priests coming to it, we immediately siezed
upon him, stopped his mouth,and tied his hands behind him,
and led him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might
not make a noise, tied his feet also together, and left him on
the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another
would come out to see what the matter was 3 but we waited so
long till the third man came back to us ; and then nobody com-
ing out, we knocked a ain gently, and immediately out came
two more, and we serve them just in the same manner, but were
obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol
same distance from one another ; when, going back we found
two more were come out to the door, and a third stood behind
them within the door. We seized the two, and immediately
tied them, when the third, stepping back and crying out, my
Scots merchant went in after them, and taking out a composr-
tion we had made that would only smoke and stink, he set fire
to it, and threw it in among them. B that time the other
Scotsman and my man, taking charge 0 the two men already
bound, and tied together also by the arm, led them away to
the idol, and left them there, to see if their idol would relieve
them, making haste back to us.

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so
much smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw
in a small leather bag of another kind, which flamed like a
candle, and following it in, we found there were but four eo-
ple, and, as we su posed, had been about some of their dia oli-
cal sacrifices. '1' ey a peared, in short, frightened to death,
at least so as to sit trem ing and stupid, and not able to speak
either for the smoke.

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had done the
others, and all without any noise. I should have said we
brought them out of the house or hut first ; for indeed we were
not able to bear the smoke any more than they were. When
we had done this, we carried them all together to the idol ;
when we came there, we fell to work with him ; and first we
daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and such
other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed with brim-
stone ; then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth full of
gun owder ; then we wrapped up a reat piece of wildfire in

is onnet; and then sticking all tie combustibles we had
brought with us upon him, we looked about us to see if we
could find anythin else to help to burn him ; when my Scots-
man remembered t at by the tent or but, where the men were,
there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes I do
not remember ; away he and the other Scotsman ran and
fetched their arms full of that. When we had done this, we
took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their
feet and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and
set them before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the
whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the
powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up,
and as we could perceive, had 5 lit and deformed the shape of
it ; and, in a word, till we saw it burned into a mere block or-
log of wood ; and setting dry forage to it, we found it would
be soon uite consumed ; so we began to think of going away ;
but the cotsman said, " No, we must not go, for these poor
deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and
burn themselves with the idol." So we resolved to stay till
the forage was burned down too, and then came away and
left them.

After the feat was performed, we apgeared in the morning
among our fellow-travelers, exceedingly usy in getting ready
for our journey ; nor could any man suggest that we had been
anywhere but in our beds, as travelers might be supposed to
be, to fit themselves for the fatigues of the day's journey.

But the affair did not end so ; the next day came a great
number of the country eople to the town gates, and in a
most outrageous manner emanded satisfaction of the Russian
governor for the insulting their priests, and burning their
great Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertzinskay were at
first in a great consternation, for the said the Tartars were
already no less than thirty thousan strong. The Russian
governor sent out messengers to appease them, and gave them
all the good words possxble; assuring them that he knew
nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison
been abroad, so that it could not be from anybody there ; but
if they could let him know who did it, they should be exem-
plarily punished. They returned haughtily, that all the coun-
try geverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in
the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to
his ilntlge but some Christian misoreant ; and they therefore
resolve to denounce war against him and all the Russians,
who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach,
or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the
Czar having strictly charged him to treat _the conquered coun-
try with gentleness and civility, gave them still all the good
words he could. At last he told them there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some
of them who had done them this injury ; and that if they
would be satisfied with that, he would send after them to in-
quire into it. This seemed to appease them a little ; and ac-
cording] the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account ow the thing was ; intimating withal,that if any in
our caravan had done it, they should make their escape ; but
that whether we had done it or no, we should make all the haste
forward that was possible ; and that, in the meantime, he
would keep them in play as long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor ; however, when it
came to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the
matter ; and as for us that were guilty, we were least of all
suspected. However, the captain of the caravan for the time,
took the hint that the governor gave us, and we traveled two
days and two nights without any considerable stop, and then
we la at a village called Plothus ; nor did we make any long
stop ere, but hastened on towards J arawena, another of the
Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expected we should
be safe. But upon the second day's march from Plothus, by
the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some of our
people began to be sensible we were pursued. We had entered
a great desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks
Oser, when we perceived a very great body of horse appear on
the other side of the lake, to the north, we traveling west.
We observed they went away west, as we did, but had supposed
we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very
happily took the south side ; and in two days more they dis-
appeared again: for they, believing we were still before them,
pushed on till they came to the river Udda, a very great river
when it passes farther north,but when we came to it we found
it narrow and fordable.

The third day they had either found their mistake or had
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards the
dusk of the evening. We had, to our great satisfaction, just

itched upon a place for our camp, which was very convenient

or the night; for as we were upon a desert, though but at
the beginning of it, that was above five hundred miles over,
we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but
the city J arawena, which we had yet two days' march to ; the
desert, however, had some few woods in it on this side, and
little rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda ; it was
in a narrow strait, between little but very thick woods, that we
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to be attacked

efore morning.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for:
but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops
in that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every
night against them, as against armies of robbers ; and it was,
therefore, no new thintr to be pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a
most advantageous camp; for we lay between two woods,
with a little rivulet running just before our front, so that we
could not be surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front
or rear. We took care also to make our front as strong as we
could, by placing our acks, with our camels and horses, all in
a line, on the inside of) the river, and felling some trees in our
rear.

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but the enemy
was upon us before we had finished. They did not come on us
like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to us,
to demand the men to be delivered to them that had abused
their priests, and burned their god Cham Chi-Thaungu with
fire, that they might burn them with fire ; and upon this, they
said they would go away, and do us no further harm ; otherwise
they would destroy us all. Our men looked very blank at this
messa e, and began to stare at one another to see who looked
with t e most guilt in their faces ; but nobody was the word--
nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was
well assured that it was not done by any of our camp ; that we
were peaceful merchants, traveling on our business ; that we
had done no harm to them or to any one else; and that, there-
fore, they must look farther for their enemies who had injured
them, for we were not the peo 1e ; so he desired them not to
disturb us, for if they did we 5 ould defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer;
and a great crowd of them came running down in the morn-
ing, by break of day, to our camp ; but seein us in such an
unaccountable situation, the durst come no arther than the
brook in our front where t ey stood, and showed us such a
number that indeed terrified us very much ;for those that
spoke least of them s oke of ten thousand. Here they stood
and looked at us a whi e, and then setting up a great howl, they
let fly a crowd of arrows among us ; but we were well enou
fortified for that, for we sheltered under our baggage, and I 0
not remember that one of us was hurt.

Some time after this we saw them move a little to our rirvht,
and expected them on the rear : when a cunning fellow, a os-
sack of J arawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the
leader of the caravan, said to him, "I'll go send all these peo-
ple away to Sibeilka." This was a city four or five days' jour-
ney at least to the right, and rather behind us. So he takes
his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides away
from our rear directly, as it were back to Nertzinskay ; after
this he takes a great circuit about, and comes directly on the
army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell them
a long story that the people who had burned the Cham Chi-
Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants,
as he called them--that is to sa , Christians : and that they had
resolved to burn the god Schal- sar, belonging to the Tongueses.

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well that they all be-
lieved him, and away they drove in a most violent hurry to
Sibeilka, which, it seems, was five days' journey to the north ;
and in less than three hours they were entirely out of our
sight, and we never heard an more of them, nor whether they
went to -Sibei1ka or no. 0 we passed away safely on to
J arawena, where there was a garrison of Muscovites, and there
we rested five days; the caravan being exceedingly fatigued
with the last day's hard march, and with want of rest in the
nirrht.

{From this city we had a friorhtful desert, which held us
twenty-three days' march. We furnished ourselves with some
tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the
night; and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages
or wagons of the country, for carrying our water or provisions ;
and these carriages were our defense every night round our
little camp : so that had the Tartars ap eared, unless they had
been very numerous indeed, they woul not have been able to
hurt us.

We may well be supposed to have wanted rest again after
this lono Journey ; for in this desert we neither saw house nor
tree, and scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of the
sable hunters, who are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of
which this country is a part ; and they frequently attack
small caravans, but we saw no numbers of them together.

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country
pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and
castles, settled by the Czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of
stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans and defend the
country against the Tartars, who would otherwise make it ve
dangerous traveling ; and his czarish majesty has given suc
strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and merchants,
that, if there are any Tartars heard of in the country detach-
ments of the garrison are always sent to see the travelers safe
from station to station. And thus the governor of Adinskoy,
whom I had an opportunity to make a visit to by means of
the Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered usa
guard of .fifty men, if we thought there was any danger, to the
next station. -

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe
we should find the country better inhabited, and the eople
more civilized; but I found myself mistaken in both ; or we
had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass through, where we
saw the same tokens of (paganism and barbarity as before ; only,
as they were conquere by the Muscovities, they were not so
dangerous ; but for rudeness of manners and idolatry, no peo-

le 1n the world ever went beyond them ; they are clothed all
in skins of beasts, and their houses are built of the same ; you
know not a man from a woman, neither by the ruggedness of
their countenances nor their clothes ; and in the Winter, when
the ground is covered with snow, they live underground in
vaults, which have cavities going from one to another.

If the Tar-tars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every cave :
besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the snow,
and, in a word, everything they do not understand, and they un-
derstand but ver little ; so that every element, every uncom-
mon thing, sets t em sacrificing. I met with nothing peculiar
myself in all this country, which I reckon was, from the desert
I spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half of it being
another desert, which took us up twelve days' severe traveling,
without house or tree; and we were obliged again to carry
our own provisions, as well water as bread. After we were
out of this desert, and had traveled two days, we came to
Janezay, a Muscovite city, or station, on the great river Jane-
zay-i which, they told us there, parted Europe from Asia.

ere I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed, ex-
cept in the Muscovite garrisons. All the country between the
river Oby and the river J anezay is as entirely pagan, and the
people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; nay, as
any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. I also
found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom I
had an opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are
not much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the
Muscovite government, which they acknowledged was true
enough ; but that, as they said, was none of their business ; that
if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguese, or
Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen
amon them, not soldiers ; and they added, with more sincerity
than expected, that they found it was not so much the con-
cern of their monarch to make the people Christians as it was
to make them subjects.
From thisriver tothe great river Oby, we crossedawild, un-
cultivated country, barren of people and good management ;
otherwise it is itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable
country. I'Vhat inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, ex-
cept such as are sent among them from Russia ; for this is
the country--I mean on both sides the river Oby--whither
the Muscovite criminals that are not put to death are banished,
and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever get
awa .

I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs till I
came to Tobolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued
some time on the followmg account.

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and
winter began to come on apace; whereupon my partner and I
called a council about our particular affairs, in which we found
it proper, as we were bound for England, and not for Moscow,
to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges
and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter time ; and,
indeed, they have such things that it would be incredible to re-
late the particulars of, by which means the Russians travel more
in winter than they can in summer, as in these sledgcs they are
able to run night and day ; the snow, bein frozen, is one uni-
versal covering to Nature, by which the hi ls, vales, rivers, and
lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon
the surface, without any regard to what is underneath.

But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kind :
'I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two
ways: either I must go on as the caravan went, till I came to
J aroslaw, and then go off west for Narva, and the Gulf of Fin-
land, and so on to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my
China cargo to good advantage ; or I must leave the caravan
at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six days
bv water to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of ship-

'5 n
ping either to England, Holland, or Hambur 11.

Now, to go any of these journeys in the wmter would have
been preposterous : for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have
been frozen up, and I could not get passage ; and to o by land
in those countries was far less safe than among the 0 ul 'l'ar-
tars ; likewise, to go to Archangel in October, all t e ships
would be gone from thence, and even the merchants who dwell
there in summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when
the ships are gone ; so that I could have nothing but extremity
of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of rovisions, and must
lie in an empty town all the winter; so t int, upon the whole,
I thought it much my better way to let the caravan go, and
make revision to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia,
in the atitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three
things to wear out a cold winter with--via, plenty of pro.
visions, such as the country afforded, a warm house, with fuel
enough, and excellent company.

I was now in uite a different climate from my beloved island,
where I never elt cold, except when I had my ague; on the
contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back,
and never made any fire but without doors, which was neces-
sary for dressing my food, etc. Now I had three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet,
and button close to the wrists ; and all these lined with furs,
to make them sufiiciently warm.

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our
way in England of making fires in every room in the house in
open chimneys, which, when the fire was out, always kept the
air in the room cold as the climate ; but taking an apartment
in a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built
like a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove ;
the funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to
come at the fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept
equally warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat the bagnios
in England. By this means we had always the same climate
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and how
cold soever it was without, it was always warm within; and
yet we saw no fire nor were ever incommoded with smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be os-
sible to meet with good company here, in a country so bar ar-
ous as that of the most northerly parts of Europe, near the
Frozen Ocean, within but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the country where the state criminals of Mus-
covy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city was full
of noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers, and eourtiers of Muscovy.
Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the old General Robos-
tiski, and several other persons of note, and some ladies. B
means of my Scots merchant, whom, nevertheless, I parted wit 1
here, I made an acquaintance with several of these gentlemen;
and from these, in the long winter nights in which I stayed here,
I received several very agreeable visits.

It was talking one night with Prince , one of the ban-
ished ministers of state belonging to the Czar of Mnscovy,
that the discourse of in particular case began. He had been
telling me abundance 0 fine things of the greatness, the mag-
nificence, the dominions, and the absolute power of the Em-
peror of the Russians : I interrupted him, and told him I was
a greater and more powerful prince than ever the Czar of Mus-
covy was, though my dominions were not so large, or my peo-
ple so many. The Russian grandee looked a little surprised,
and, fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I
meant. I told him his wonder would cease when I had explained
myself. First, I told him I had absolute disposal of the lives
and fortunes of all my subjects; that notwithstanding my
absolute power, I had not one person disafiected to my govern-
ment, or to my person, in all my dominions. He shook his head
at that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the Czar of Muscovy.
I told him that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and
all my subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will ;
that they would all fight for me to the last drop; and that
never tyrant, for suchI acknowledged myself to be, was ever
so universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared, by his sub-
'ects.

J After amusing him with these riddles in government for a
while, I opened the case, and told him the story at large of my
living in the island ; and how I managed both myself and the
people that were under me, just as I have since minuted it down.
.l'hey were exceedingly taken with the story, and especially
the prince, who told me, with a sigh, that the true greatness
of life was to be masters of ourselves ; that he would not have
exchanged such a state of life as mine to be Czar of Muscovy ;
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed
to be banished to there than ever he found in the highest au-
thority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar; that
the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down
to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under the
weight of the greatest storms without. then he came first
hither, he said he used to tear the hair from his head, and
the clothes from his back, as others had done before him ; but
a little time and consideration had made him look into himself,
as well as round him, to things without; that he found the
mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the
state of universal life, and how little this world was concerned
in its true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity
for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best
ends and desires, with but very little assistance from the world.
The air to breath in, food to sustain life, clothes for warmth,
and liberty for exercise, in order to health, completed, in his
opinion, all that the world could do for us; and though the
greatness, the authority, the riches, and the pleasures which
some enjoyed in the world, had much in them that was agree-
able to us, yet all those things chiefly gratified the coarsest of
our affections, such as our ambition, our particular pride, ava-
rice, vanity, and sensuality; all which, being the mere product
of the worst part of man, were in themselves crimes, and had
in them the seeds of all manner of crimes; but neither were
related to, nor concerned with, any of those virtues that con-
stituted us wise men, nor of those graces that distinguished us
as Christians ; that being now deprived of all the fancied felic-
ity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he
said he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them, where
he found all manner of deformity ; and was now convinced that
virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and pre-
serves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future state ;
and in this, he said, they were more happy in their banishment
than all their enemies were, who had the full possession of all
the wealth and power they had left behind them. "Nor, sir,"
says he, " do I bring my mind to this politically, from the neo-
essity of my circumstances, which some call miserable; but,
if I know anything of myself, I would not now go back, though
the Czar my master should call me, and reinstate me in all my
former grandeur ; I say, I would no more go back to it than I
believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison of
the body, and has had a taste of the lorious state beyond life,
would come back to the goal of ties and blood it is now in-
closed in, and leave heaven, to trail in the dirt and crime of
human afiairs."

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much
earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it
was the true sense of his soul; there was no room to doubt
his sincerity. I told him I once thou ht myself a kind of
monarch in my old station, of which I ad given him an ac-
count ; but that I thought he was not only a monarch, but a
great conqueror ; for he that had got a victory over his own
exorbitant desires, and the absolute dominion over himself, he
whose reason entirely governs his will, is certainly greater
than he that conquers a city. " But, my lord," said I, " shall
I take the liberty to ask you a question ?" " With all my
heart," says he. "If the door of your liberty was opened,"
said I, " would you not take hold of it, to deliver yourself from
this exile?" " Hold," said he ; " your question is subtle and
requires some serious, just distinctions to give it 'a sincere
answer ; and I will give it you from the. bottom of my heart.
Nothing that] know of in the world would move me to deliver
myself from this state of banishment, except these two : first,
the enjoyment of my relations ; and, secondly,a little warmer
climate 3 but I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of
the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a minister of
state ; the wealth, the gayety, and the pleasure of a courtier;
if my master should send me word this moment that he restores
me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at
all, I would not leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these
frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow." "But, my lord,"
said I, " perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures
of the court, and from the power, authority, and wealth you
enjoyed before, but you may be absent, too, from some of the
conveniences of life: your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and
your effects plundered ; and the supplies left you here may
not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life." " Ay," says
he, " that is as you suppose me to be a lord, or a prince, etc.,
so, indeed,I am; but you are now to consider me only as a
'man, a human creature, not at all distinguished from another;
'and so I can suifer no want, unless I should be visited with
sickness and distempers. However, to put the question out of
dispute, you see our way of life: we are, in this place, five
persons of rank 3 we live perfectly retired, as suited to a state
of banishment; we have something rescued from the ship-
wreck of our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity
-of hunting for our food ; but the poor soldiers, who are here
without that help, live in as much plenty as we, who go in the
woods and catch sables and faxes ; the labor of a month will
maintain them a year ; and as the way of living is not expen-
sive, so it is not hard to get sufficient for ourselves. So that
objection is out of doors. '

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable
conversation I had with this truly great man ; in all which he
showed that his mind was so inspired with asuperior knowledge
of things, so sup orted by religion, as well as by a vast share
of wisdom, that is contempt of the world was really as much
as he had expressed, and that he was always the same to the
last, as will appear in the story I am goin to tell.

I had been here eight months, and a dar , dreadful winter I
thought it; the cold so intense that I could not so much as
look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur
before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath,
and two for sight: the little daylight we had was, as we reck-
oned, for three months not above five hours a day, and six at
most; only that the snow lying on the ground continually,
and the weather being clear, it was never quite dark. Our
horses were kept, or rather starved, underground ; and as for
our servants, whom we hired here to look after ourselves and
horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers and toes
t; thaw and take care of, lest they should mortify, and fall
0 .

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close,
the walls thick, thelights small, and the lass all double. Our
food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried an cured in the season ;
bread good enough, but baked as biscuits ; dried fish of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton and of buffaloes, which is pretty
good meat. All the stores of provisions for the winter are
laid up in the summer, and well cured ; our drink was water,
mixed with aqua vitaa instead of brandy ; and for a treat,
mead instead of wine, which, however, they have very good.
The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, fre uently
brought us in fine venison, and sometimes bear's fleshfiiut we
did not much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends, and we lived very cheer-
fully and well, all things considered.

It was now March, the days grown considerable longer, and
the weather at least tolerable; so the other travelers began
to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get
things ready to be going ; but my measures being fixed, as I
have said, for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic,I
made no motion ; knowing very well that the ships from the
south do not set out for that part of the world till May or
June ; and that if I was there by the beginning of August, it
would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away;
and therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did: in a
word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the travelers, go
away before me. It seems every year they go from thence
to Muscovy for trade, to carry furs, and buy necessaries, which
they bring back with them to furnish their shops : also others
went on the same errand to Archangel ; but then they all being
to come back again above eight hundred miles, went out before
me.

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up ;
and, as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these
people were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and
yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to go whither
they would, why they did not then go away to any part of the
world, wherever they thought fit: and I began to examine
what should hinder them from making such an attempt. But
my wonder was over when I entered upon that subject with
the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus : " Con-
sider, first, sir," said he, " the place where we are ; and, secondly,
the condition we are in ; especially the generality of the peo-
ple who are banished hither. \Ve are surrounded with stronger
things than bars or bolts ; on the north side, an unnavigable
ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never swam ; ever
other way we have above a thousand miles to pass throng
the Czar's own dominions, and by ways utterly impassable,
except by the roads made by the Government, and through
the towns garrisoned by his troops ; so that we could neither
pass undiscovered by the road, nor subsist any other way; so
that it is in vain to attempt it."

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in
a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in
the castle at Moscow ; however, it came into my thoughts that
I might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape
of this excellent person ; and that, whatever hazard I ran, I
would certainly try if I could carry him ofi'. Upon this, I took
an occasion, one evening, to tell him my thoughts. "I repre-
sented to him that it was very easy for me to carry him away,
there being no guard over him in the country ; and as I was
not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the
retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the
stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterru ted to Arch-
angel, where I would immediately secure him on oard an Eng-
lish ship, and carry him safe along with me ; and as to his
subsistence and other particulars, it should be my care till he
could better supply himself.

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me
all the while I s oke ; nay, I could see in his very face that
what I said ut is sprits into an exceeding ferment ; his color
frequently c anged, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered,
till it might be even perceived-in his countenance ; nor could
he immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it were,
hesitated what he would say to it : but, after he had paused a
little, be embraced me, and said, "How unhappy are we, un-

uarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest acts of

riendship are made snares unto us, and we are made tempters
of one another ! My dear friend," said he, "your offer is so
sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and
is so calculated for my advantage, that I must have very little
knowledge of the world if I did not both wonder at it, and ac-
knowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for it. But
did you believe I was sincere in what I have often said to you
of my contempt of the world ? Did you believe I spoke my
very soul to you, and that I had really obtained that de ree of
felicity here that had placed me above all that the worl could
give me? Did you believe I was sincere when I told you I
would not go back, if I was recalled even to be all that I once
was in the court, with the favor of the Czar my master? Did
. ou believe me, my friend, to be an honest man ? or did on

elieve me to be a boasting hypocrite?" Here he stoppe , as
if he would hear what I would say ; but, indeed, I soon after
perceived that he stopped because his spirits were in motion,
)is great heart was full of struggles, and he could not go on.
I was, I confess, astonished at the thing as well as at the man,
and I used some arguments with him to urge him to set him-
self free ; that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by
Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, who
has the care and dis osition of all events, to do himself good,
and to render himse f useful in the world.

He had by this time recovered himself. " How do you know,
sir," says he, warmly, " but that, instead of a summons from
Heaven, it may be a feint of another instrument ; representing
in alluring colors to me the show of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly, to my ruin?
Here, I am free from the temptation of returning to my former
miserable greatness; there, I am not sure but that all the seeds
of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word, again over-
whelm me; and then the happy risoner, whom you see now
master of his soul's liberty, shall e the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the full enjoyment of all personal liberty. Dear
sir, let me remain in this blessed confinement, banished from
the crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at
the expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the future hap-
piness which I now have in my view, but shall then, I fear,
quickly lose sight of ; for I am but flesh ; a man, amere man ;
have passions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow
me as any man. Oh, be not my friend and tempter both to-
gether ! "

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood
silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I sawa The
struggle in his soul was so great that, though the weather was
extremely cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, and I
found he wanted to give vent to his mind ; so I said a word
or two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again, and then I withdrew to my own apartment.

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the
door of m room, and I was going to open the door, but he
had opens it, and come in. " My dear friend," says he, " you
had almost overset me, but I am recovered. Do not take it
ill that I do not close with your ofier. I assure you it is not
for want of sense of the kindness of it in you ; and I came to
make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you ; but I
hope I have got the victory over myself." " My lord," said I,
" I hope you are fully satisfied that you do not resist the call
of Heaven." " Sir," said he, "if it had been from Heaven, the
same power would have influenced me to have accepted it; but
I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I
decline it, and I have infinite satisfaction in the parting, that
you shall leave me an honest man still, thou h not a free man."

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, an make professions
to him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve
him. He embraced me very passionately, and assured me he
was sensible of that, and should always acknowledge it ; and
with that he offered me a very fine present of sables,---too
much, indeed, for me to acce t from a man in his circumstances,
and I would have avoided t em, but he would not be refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with
a small resent of tea and two pieces of China damask, and
four litt e wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above
six ounces or thereabouts, but were far short of the value of his
sables, which, when I came to England, I found worth near two
hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece of the
damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp
upon it, of the J apan coinage, which I found he took for the
rarity of it, but would not take any more : and he sent word
by my servant that he desired to speak with me.

When I came to him, he told me I knew what had passed
between us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that
affair ; but that, since I made such a generous ofier to him, he
asked me if I had kindness enough to offer the same to another
person that he would name to me, in whom he had a reat
share of concern. I told him that I could not say I inc ined
to do so much for any but himself, for whom I had a particular
value, and should have been glad to have been the instrument
of his deliverance; however, if he would please to name the
person to me, I would give him my answer. He told me it
was his only son ; who, though I had not seen him, yet was in
the same condition with himself, and above two hundred
miles from him, on the other side of the Oby ; but that, if I
consented, he would send for him.

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholl
on his account ; and that, seeing I could not prevail on him,
would show my respect to him by my concern for his son ;
but these things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent theCuusun Plan-muse was 1113 LAST Jovkxav.--Pnge 4-17.
next day for his son ; and in about twenty days he came back
with the messen er, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with
very rich furs, w ich, in the whole, amounted to a very great
value. His servants brought the horses into the towu, but left
the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito
into our apartment, and his father presented him to me ; and,
in short, we concerted the manner of our traveling, and every-
thingl proper for the journey.

I ad bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox
skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich in
that cit ,in exchange for some of the goods I had brought
from C ina; in particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of
which I sold the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at
Archangel, for a much better price than I could have got at
London ; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and
whose business, more particularly than mine, was merchandise,
was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the traffic we
made here. ' '

It was the beginning of June when Ileft this remote place ;
a city, I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, it
is so far out of the road of commerce, that I know not how it
should be much talked of. We were now reduced to a verv
small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels in all,
and all of them passed for mine, though my new guest was
proprietor of eleven of them ; it was most natural, also, that I
should take more servants with me than I had before; and the
young lord assed for my steward ; what great man I passed
for myself, know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.

We had here the worst and the largest desert to ass over
that we met with in our whole journey; I call it the worst
because the way was very deep in some places, and very un-
even in others; the best we had to say for it was, that we
thought we had no troops of Tartar-s or robbers to fear,and
that they never came on this side the river Oby, or at least
very seldom ; but we found it otherwise.

My oung lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was
perfect y acquainted with the country, and led us by private
roads, so that we avoided coming into the rinci a1 towns and
cities upon the great road, such as Tumen, oloy amskoi, and
several others ; because the Muscovite garrisons which are
kept there are very curious and strict in their observation
upon travelers, and searching lest any of the banished persons
0 note should make their escape that way into Muscovy ; but,
by this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole
journey was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie
in our tents, when we might have had very good accommoda-
tion in the cities on the way ; this the young lord was so sensible
of that he would not allow us to lie abroad when 'we came to
seVeral cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his
servant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed
aces.

P \Ve had just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama,
which in these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia,
and the first city on the European side was called Soloy Kamskoi,
which is as much as to say, the great cit on the river Kama ;
and here we thought to see some evi ent alteration in the
people; but we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert
to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long in some (places.
but not above two hundred miles over where we passe it, so
till we came past the horrible place, we found very little dif-
ference between that countr and the Mogul Tartary ; the
people are mostly pagans, an little better than the savages of
America ; their houses and towns full of idols, and their way
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities, and the villages
near them, where they are Christians, as they call themselves,
of the Greek Church, but have their religion mingled with so
many relics of superstition that it is scarce to be known in
some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must (after all
our dangers were, to our ima ination, escaped) have been
plundered and robbed, and per aps murdered, by a troop of
thieves; of what country they were, I am yet at a loss to
know ; but they were all on horseback, carried bows and
arrows, and were at first about forty-five in number; they
came so near to us as to be within two musket-shots, and, ask-
ing no questions, surrounded us with their horses, and looked
very earnestly upon us twice; at length, they placed them-
selves just in our way ; upon which we drew up in a little line,
before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all; and,
being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the Siberian
servant, who attended his lord, to see who the were ; his master
was the more willing to let him 0 because )e was not a little
apprehensive that they were a iberian troop sent out afte;
him. The man came up nearer them with a flag of truce, and
called to them; but though he spoke several of their lan-
guages, or dialects of languages rather, he could not under-
stand a word they said ; however, after some signs to him not
to come near them at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser
than he went : only that by their dress, he said, he believed
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes
and that there must be more of them upon the great desert,
gigugh he never heard that any of them were seen so far north
e ore.

About an hour after, they a ain made a motion to attack us,
and rode round our little wood8 to see where they might break
in ; but finding us always ready to face them, they went of
again ; and we resolved not to stir for that niaht.

This was small comfort to us; however, we xhad no remedy ;
there was, on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile dis-
tance, a little grove, and very near the road; I immediately
resolved we should advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves
as well as we could there ; for, first, I considered that the trees
would in a great measure cover us from their arrows; and, in
the next place, they could not come to charge us in a body;
it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and
who had this excellency attending him, that he was always
readiest and most a t to direct and encourage us in cases of
the most dan or. e advanced immediatel , with what speed
we could, an gained that little wood ; the artars, or thieves,
for we knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and
not attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we found,
to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece of ground,
and on the one side a very great sprinor of water, which, runnina
out in a little brook, was a little farther joined by another 0?
the like size; and was, in short, the source of a considerable
river, called afterwards the Wirtska ; the trees which grew
about this spring were not above two hundred, but very large,
and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we ot in, we saw
ourgelves perfectly safe from the enemy unless t ey attacked us
on oot.

While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some
hours, without perceiving that they made any movement, our
Portuguese, with some help, out several arms of trees half off,
and laid them hanging across from one tree to another, and in
a manner fenced us in. About two hours before night, they
came down directl upon us ; and though we had not perceived
it, we found they ad been joined by some more, so that they
were near fourscore horse ; whereof, however, we fancied some
were women. They came on till they were within half-shot of
our little wood, when we fired one musket without ball, and
called to them in the Russian tongue, to know what they
wanted; and bade them keep off; but they came on with a
double fury up to the woodside, not imagining we were so bar-
ricaded that they could not easily break in. Our old pilot was
our captain, as well as our engineer, and desired us not to fire
upon them till they came within pistol-shot, that we might be
sure to kill, and that when we di fire we should be sure to
take orood aim ; we bade him give the word of command, which
he defiayed so long, that thev were some of them within two
pikes' length of us when we let fly. We aimed so true that we
~illed fourteen of them, and wounded several others, as also
several of their horses 5 for we had all of us loaded our pieces
with two or three bullets at least.

They were terribly sur rised with our fire, and retreated im-
mediately about one hundred rods from us; in which time we
loaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance,
we sallied out, and caught four or five of their horses, whose
riders we supposed were killed ; and coming up to the dead,
we judged they were Tartar-s, but knew not how they came to
make an excursion such an unusual length.

We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of
the night in strengthening our situation, and barricading the en-
trances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited
for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome
discover indeed ; for the enemy, who we thought were dis-
courage with the reception they met with, were now greatl
increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if
they were resolved to besiege us; and this little camp they
had pitched upon the open plain, about three-quarters of a mile
from us. \Ve were indeed surprised at this discovery; and
now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had ;
the loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though ver con-
siderable, as the thoughts of falling into the hands of sue bar-
barians, at the latter end of my journey, after so many difli-
culties and hazards as I had gone through, and even in sight
of our port, where we expected safety and deliverance. As to
my artner, he was raging, and declared that to lose his goods
won 6. be his ruin, and that he would rather die than be starved,
and he was for fighting to the last drop.

The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fighting to the last
also ; and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to re-
sist them all in the situation we were then in; and thus we
spent the day in debates of what we should do : but towards
evening we found that the number of our enemies still increased,
and we did not know but by the morning the might still be
a greater number; so Ibegan to inquire of tiose people we
ha brought from Tobolski, if there were no private ways by
which we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps retreat
to some town, or get help to guard us over the desert. The
Siberian who was servant to the young lord told us, if we de-
signed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to carry
us off in the night, to a way that went north, towards the river
Petrou, by which he made no question but we might at away,
and the Tartars never discover it : but he said his 101' had told
him he would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight.
I told him he mistook his lord ; for that he was too wise a man
to love fightin for the sake of it ; that I knew his lord was
brave enough, y what he had showed already; but that his
lord knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen men to
fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them
to it ; and that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the
night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He an-
swered, if his lordship gave him such orders, he would lose his
life if he did not erform it ; we soon brought his lord to give
that order, thong privately, and we immediately prepared for
putting it in practice.

And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in
our little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to
make it burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were
still there ; but as soon as it was dark, and we could see the stars
(for our guide would not stir before), having all our horses and
camels ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who I soon
found steered himself by the north star.

After we had traveled two hours very hard, it began to be
lighter still ; not that it was dark all' night, but the moon be-
gan to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be ; but by six o'clock the next morning, we had
got above thirty miles, having almost 3 oiled our horses. Here
we found a Russian village, named I ermazinskoy, where we
rested, and heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day.
About two hours before night we set out again, and traveled
till eight the next morning, though not quite so hard as before ;
and about seven o'clock we passed a little river called Kirtza,
and. came to a good large town inhabited by Russians, called
Ozomoys ; there we heard that several troops of Kalmucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now com-
pletely out of danger of them, which was to our great satisfac-
tion. Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses, and hav-
ing need enough of rest, we stayed five days : and my partner
and I agreed to give the honest Siberian who brought us thither
the value of ten pistoles.

In five days more we came to Veuslima upon the river Wirt--
zogda, and running into the Dwina: we were there, very hap-
pily, near the end of our travels by land, that river being navi-
gable, in seven days' passage, to Archangel. From hence, we
came to Lawrenskoy, the 3d of July ; and, providing ourselves
with two luggage boats, and a barge for our own convenience,
we embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe at Archangel the
18th ; having been a year, five months, and three days on the
journe , including our stay of eight months at Tobolski. We
were 0 liged to sta at this place six weeks for the arrival of
the ships, and must ave tarrled longer had not an Hamburgher
come in above a month sooner than any of the English ships ;
when, after some consideration that the city of I'Iamburgh,
might happen to be as good a market for our goods as London,
we all took freight with him ; and, having put our goods on
board, it was most natural for me to put my steward on board
to take care of them; by which means my young lord had a
sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, never comin on shore
again all the time we stayed there; and this he di that he
might not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow mer-
chants would certainly have seen and discovered him.

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the
same year; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived
safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner and
I found a very good sale for our goods, as well those of China
as the sables, etc., of Siberia ; and, dividing the produce, my
share amounted to PS3475 17s. 8d., including about six hundred
pounds' worth of diamonds, which I purchased at Bengal.

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the
Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved
to seek protection, and could corres ond with those of his fath-
er's friends who were left alive. e did not part without tes-
timonies of gratitude for the service I had done him, and for
my kindness to the prince, his father.

To conclude : having stayed near four months in Hamburgh,
I came from thence by land to The Hague, where I embarked
in the packet, and arrived in London the 10th of January, 1705,
having been absent from England ten years and nine months.
And here I resolved to prepare for a longer journey than all
these, having lived a life of infinite variety seventy-two years,
and learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and
the blessing of ending our days in peace.(v T... wwwyTfixaTTE $4.... T M. _ ...
