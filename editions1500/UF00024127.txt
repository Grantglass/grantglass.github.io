flDVENTURES

OF

RDBiNSON CRU'SOE, EUR92:

Was born in the Year 163 2, in the

" City of Rrkhof a goOd Family, tho'
not of that Country, my Father be-
inga F or'ei ghcr of Bremeiz, who fettled
firlt at Hafiz He got a good Efiatc
i by Me'rchandize, and leaving off his

Trade, liVed afterward at Tar/e, from v'Vhe'nce he had
married my Mother, whofe Relations were named
Ralzz'nfim, a very good Family in that Country, and
from whom I was called Roeirzfm Krezzt'znaer 5 but by
the ufual Corruption of Words in England, weare
nov'v called', nay we call our (elves, and Write our
NameCrufie,and {o myCompanions always call'd me.

B I had, . . E Z l . _

I had two elder Brorhers, one, of which was
Lieutenant-Collonel to an 5252in J Regiment of'Foot
in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous
Col.Loclelmrt, and was killed at the Battle near Duns
kirk againl't the Spaniards : What became of my fe>>
cond Brother I never knew, any more than my Fas
. ther or Mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred
to any Trade, my Head began to be fill'd Very
early with rambling Thoughts : My Father, who
was very ancient, had given me a competent Share
of Learning, as far as Horde-Education, and a
Country Free--School generally goes, and defign'd
me for the Law 5 but I would be {atisfied with no~
.. thing but oing to Sea, and my Inclination to this

led me {o Erongly againft the Will, nay, the Com~
mands of my Father, and againit all the Entreaties
and Perfuafions of my Mother, and other Friends,
that there feem'd to be fomething fatal in that
propenfion of Nature tending direetly towards
the Life of Mifery which was to befal me.

My Father, a wife and grave Man, gave me
ferious and excellent Counfel againft what he fore~
{aw was my Defign. He called me one Morning in-
to his Chamber, where he was confined by the
Gout, and expoflulated very warmly with me upon-
. _ this Subject: He ask'd me what Reafons more than

' a. meer wandring Inclination I had for leaving my
Father's Houfe and my native Country, where I
might be well introduced, and had a Profpe8c
of railing my Fortune by Application and In-
dufiry, with a Life of Eafe and Pleafure. He
told me it was for Men of defperare Fortunes on
one Hand, or ol'afpiring, fuuerior'Fortunes on the
other, who went abroad Upon Adventures, to rife '
' by Enterprize, and make themfelves famous in Una
.dertakings of a Nature out of the common Road;
' t lat. E 3 3
that thefe Things were all either too far above me;
':or to far below me ; that mine was the middle
State, or what might be called the upper Station
ofLow Life, which he had found by long Experiei-
fence was the beft State in the World; the mofi:
fuited to human Happinefs, not expofed to the Mia
feries and Hardihips, the Labour and Sui-Perings of
the mechanick Part of Mankind, and not emba-i
rafs'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and En:
vy oftthe upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I
might judge of the Happinefs of this State, by this
'one thing, rvia. That this was the State of Life;
which all other PC'OplC envied 3 that Kings have.
"frequently lamented the miferable Confequences of
being born to great Things, and with they had
been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes,
between the Mean and the Great; that the wife
Man gave his T eflimony to this as the j uit Standard
of true Felicity, when he prayed to haVe neither
Poverty or Riches. ' t _
_ He bid me obferve it, and I ihbuld always find,"
that the Calamities of Life were {hated ameng the
upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the
middle Station had the fevtreft Difaiters; ..and was
n0t expos'd to {'0 many Vicifiitudes as the higher or
lower Part of Mankind; nay; they were not fubje~
&ed to fo many Difiempets and Uneafineifes either
a of Body or Mind, a3" thofe were, who by yicious
Living,- Luimty and Extravagancies on one Hand;
Or by hard Labour, want ofNeCefiaries, and Mean
or infuflicient Diet on the other Hand, bring Din
[tempers upon themfelVes by the natural Confequenv
ees of their Way of Living; T/Jat the middle Sta-
tion of Life was Calculated for all kind of Virtues"
and all kind of Enjoyments' ;' that Peace and Hen-1
ty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune ,2
that Temperance, Moderation, Quietn'efs, Health-1;
' B 2- . Soeivj:_ [4']

Society, all agreeable Diverfions, and all defirable'
Pleafures, were the Bleflings attending the middle
Station of Life 5 that this Way Men went filently
and {moothly thro' the World, and comfortably out
'of it, ' not embarafs'd with the Labours of the
. Hands or'of the Head, not {oldto the'Life of Sla--
-Very for 'daily Bread, or harrafs'd with perplex'd
Circumfiances which rob the Soul of Peace, and
' the Body of Bell; not enrag'd with the Paflion of
Envy, or {ecret burning Lufi of Ambition forgreat
Things; ' but in eafy Circumilances fliding gently
thro' the World, and fenfibly tailing the Sweets of
living, without the bitter, feeling-that they are,
happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to

know it more fenfibly.
' After this he prefs'd me earneflly, and in the
molt affeetionate manner, net to play the young
Man, not 'to precipitate my {elf into Miferies which
Nature and the Stationof Life I was born in,
feem? d to have provided againfl 5 that I was under
no Necefiity of feeking my Bread 5 that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
into the Station of Life which he had been jul'c ree-
commending to me 5 and that if I was not very ea-
fy and happy in the World, it mull be my meer
Fate or Fault that muff hinder it, and that he
{hould have nothing to anfwe r for, having thus clif-
charg'd his Duty in warning me againfi Meafure's
which he knew would be to my Hurt : In a word,
that as he would do very kind Things for me.
if I would flay and fettle at Home as he directed,
fo he would not have {0 much Hand in my Misfor-
., . tunes, as to give me any Encouragement to go
away: And to clofe all, he told me, I had 'my
elder Brotherfor an Example, to whom he had ufed
the fame earneft Perfuafions to keep him from g0"
ing into the Low-County Wars, but cou'd not prel-
V3.1[5] K

vail, his young Defires prompting him to run into
the Army where he was kill'd 5 ' and tho' he [aid
he'would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would
venture to fay to me, that if I did take this fooliflt
Step, God would not blels me, and I would have
Le'ifure hereafter to reflee't upon having negleeied
his Counfel, when there might be none to aliii'c in
my Recovery. ' ' _ ' _ p

I obferved in' this lait Part of his Difcourfe,
Which was truly Prophetiek, tho" I {uppof'e my
Father did not know it to be (0 himfelf ,7 I fay, I
obferved the Tears run down his Face very plen-
tifully, and'efpecially when he {poke of my Brother
who was kill'd ,- and- that when he {poke of my ha-
ving Leifure to repent, and'none to aflifi: me, he
was {0' mov'd, that he broke oil~ the Difcourle, and
told me, his Heart 'was Io full, he could fay no
more to me. "

I was 'fincerely afl'eaed with this Difcourfe, as
indeed who could be otherwife? and Irefolv'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle
at Home according to my F ather's Delire. But a-
lafs.l a few Days wore it all oflF 5 and in fliort, to
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunitie's,
in a Few Weeks after, I refolv'd to run quite away
from him. However, I did not a& {o hallily neither
as my firlt Heat of Refolution prompted, but I
took my Mother, at a Time when I thought her a
little pleafanter than ordinary, and told her, that
my Thoughts were. {o'entirely bent upon feeing the
Wei-1d, that I ihould never {ettle to any thing with

- Refolution enough to go. through with it, and my
Father had better give me his Confent than force '
me to go without it; that-I was now eighteen
Years old, which was too late to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney; that Iwagsfure
if I did, 'I ihould neverBfei-vc our my Time, and I

flipuld certainly run away from my Maflet'before
my Time was out, and go to Sea ,- and if {he would
{peak to .my Father to let me go one Voyage a:
broad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
would go no. more, and I would promife by a done
1,316 Diligence torecover that Time I had loft. '
' This put my Mother into a great Paflion : She
told me,' {he knew it would be to no Purpofe to
{peak to my Father upon any fuch Subject 5 that he
lcnew too well what was my Intereit to give his
Cenfentto any fuch Thing'fo much far my Hurt:
and that flie wondered how I could think of any fuch
Thing after fuch a Difeourfe as I had had with my '
Father, and fuch kind and tender EXpi'eiIiOns as {he
knew my Father had us'd to me ,- and that in fliort,
if I would ruin my felf, there was no Help for me;
but I might depend I fliould never have their Cone
{cut to it: That for her Part {he would not have In
inuch Hand in myDeftrufizion; and I {heuld never;
have it to fay, that my Mother was willing when
my Father was not. '

' T ho' my Mother refufed tomove it to my Father,
yet as I have heard afterwards, the reported all the
Difcourfe to him, and that my Father, after {hewing
a great Concern at it, {aid to her with a Sigh, That,'
Boy might be happy if he would Ray at home, but if
he goes abroad, he will be the molt miferableil
Wretch that ever was born 3. I can give no Confent
to It.

Itwas not till almoi't a Year after this that I broke
loofe, tho' in the mean time I continued obfiinately
deaf to all Propofitls of fettling' to Bufinefs, and fre~
qucntly expofiulating with my Father and Mother,
about their being fo politively determin'dagaiufi:
what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to. '

and without any Purpofe of making an Elopemenr

that time; but Ifay, being there, and one of my
Companions being going by Sea to London, in 1113
Father's Ship, and prompting me to go with them,
with the common Allurement ofSeafaring Men, viz.
That it {hould colt me nothing for my Baffage, I
confulted neither Father nor Mother any more, nor
fo much as [cut them Word of it ; but leaving them
to hear of it as they might, without asking Gods
Blefling, or my Father's, without any Confideration
- of Ci rcumflances or Confequences,and in an ill Hour,
God knows, on the firfl of September 1651, I went
on Board a Ship bound for London : Never any young
Adventuret's Misfortunes, I believe, began fooner,
or continued longer. than mine. The Ship was no
fooner gotten-out of the Ember, but the Wind be--
gan to blow, and the Sea to rife in a moft frightful
manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was
molt inexpreflibly fick inBody,.andterrify'd in Mind:
I began now ferioufly to refleet upon what I had
done, and how jullly I was overtaken by the Judg-
ment of HeaVen for my wicked leaving my Father's
Houfe, and abandoning my Duty; all the good
Counfelof my Parents, my Father's Tears, and my
Mother's Entreaties came now frefh into my Mind;
and my Confcience, which was not yet come to the"
Pitch of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, re;
proa-ch'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the
Breach of my Duty to God and my Father.

All this while the. Storm encreas'd, and the Sea,"
which I had never been upon before,went very high,
tho' n0thing' like what I have feen ' many times
fince ; no, nor" like what I {aw a few Days after :
But it was enough to afFeEt me then, who was but
a young Sailor, and had never known any thingr of
the Matter. I expee'ced every Wave would have
fwallowcd' us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow.

. ' B 4 ' of.E 81

of the Sea, we {hould never rife more; and in this
Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and R6f01u~
tions, that if it would pleafe God here to {pare
my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my
Foot upon dry Land again, I would go direetly'
home to my Father, and never fet it into a Ship a~
gain while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice,
and never run my felt" into fuch Miferies as thelc a-
' my more. Non,r I {aw plainly the Goodneis of his
Obfervations about the middle Station of Lil-"e,
how eafy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his
Days, and never had been expoS'd to Tempefis at
Sea, or Troubles On Shore 5 and I refolv'd that I
would, like. a true repenting Prodigal, go home to
my Father. ' '

' T hei'e wife and fober Thoughts continued all the
while the Storm continued, and indeed fame time
after 5 but the next Day the Wind w'a's abated and
the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little innur'd
to it: However, I was very gra'Ve for all that Day,
being alfo a little Sea fick Itill; but towards Night
the, Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite. over,
a charming fine Evening follow'd; the Sun' went
down perfeetly clear, and role fo the next Morn--i
. ing; and having little or no Wind, and a finoorh
Sea, the Sun fluning. upon it, the Sight was, as I
thought, the 111057: delightful that ever I law.

I had ilept well in the Night, and was now no
more SeLfick, but very chearful, looking with
Wonder upon the Sea that was {0 rough and terri-
ble the Day before, and oculd be {0 calm and fo
pleafant in lo little time after. And now leafi my
good Refolutions ihould continue, my Companion,'
who had indeed entic'd me away, comes to me,
1/7/21], Bob, fays he, clapping me on the Shoulder,
How do you do after it? I warrant you were 'i'iglated,
wz'n't you [afl Mglyt, when it New but a Cap/ill! of

' .Wt'izd 3'[ 9 ll

lzle Storm : A Storm, yoa Pool you, "replies he, do you
call tlaat a Storm, why it was nothing at all; give at but
a good Ship and Sea-room, and we tbz'rzk not/ging'oj fuel)
a Squall of Mad as tlaat; lzat you're but, a ire/l) Water
Sailor, Bob ; come let us make a Bowl- of Panel: and
we'll forget all that, ol'ye fee w/mt charming PVeat/oer 'tzk
now. To make fhort this fad Part of my Story,
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch was
made, and'I was made drunk with it, and in that
one Night's Wickednefs I drowned all my Repen-
tance, all my Refleetions upon my pail Conduec,
' and all my Refolutions for my future. In a word,
as the Sea' was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur-
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over,
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallow'd up
by the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of my
former Defires return'd, I entirely forgot the Vows
and Promifes that I-made in my Diltrefs. I found
indeed fome Intervals of Reflee'tion, and the ferious
Thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return a-
gain fometimcs, but I fhook-them off, and rouz'd
my fell from them as it were from a Difiemper, '
and applying my {elf to Drinking and Company,
foon maller'd the Return of thofe Fits, for lo I
eall'd them, and I had in five or fix Days get as ,
compleat a ViEURtory over Confcience as any young
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubl'd with it,
could defire : But I was to have another Trzal for it
Pcill; and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally
a it does, 'refolv'd to leave me entirely Without EX-
cufe. For if I would not take this for a Del_ive-.
rance, the next was to be Inch 2 one as the worft
and mofi harden'd Wretch among us would Cont
fefs both the Danger and the Mercy, '
The[JI-o J '

The fixth Day of our being at Sea we came. in-

toTarmoutla Roads ; the Wind having been contra-
.ry, and the Weather calm, we had made but little
Way fince the Storm. Here we were obliged to
come to an Anchor, and here welay, the Wind c0n~
tinuing contrary, <<viz. at South-well, for {even or
eight Days, during which time a great many Ships
from Newcafllc came into the fame Roads, as the.
common Harbour where the Ships might wait for
a Wind for the River. ' . _ .
' We had nor however rid here {0 long, but flzould.
have Tided it'up the River, .but that the Wind
blew too frelh; and after we had lain four or five
Days, blew veryrhard. However, the Roads be;
ing reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage>>
good, and our Ground--Tackle very Pcrong, our
Men were unconcerned, and not in the leaft appre".
henfive of Danger, but {pent the Time in Relt and
Mirth, after the manner of the Sea; but the eighth
Day in the Morning, the Wind increafed, and we
had all Hands at. Work to {trike our Top-Malls>>.
and make every thing {hug and clofe, that the Sh-iR
might ride as eafy as polible. By Noon the Sea
went very high indeed, and our Ship rid Forecafllc
in, {hipp'd feveral Seas, and we thought once or
twice our Anchor had come home; upon which
our Mailer order'd out the Sheet Anchor; {0 that
we rode with two Anchors a--head, and the Cables
1(6er out to the better End.'

By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed,
and now I began tofee Terror and Amazemeqt in
the Faces. even of the Seamen theinfelves. The Ma~
fier, tho' vigilant in the Bufinefs of preferving the
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabbin by
me, I could hear him foftly to himfelf fay feveral
times, Lord be merciful to m, 'we j/Jall be all lofl, Ive
flail bee/1 undone 3 and thclike. During thefe 1-er

nt-in]

Entries, I was fiupid, lying {till in my Cabbin;
which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe my
Temper: I eohld ill reaffirm: the fill Penitence,
which I had {0 apparently trampled upon, and hat-
'de'n'd my [elf againit: I thought the Bitterne'fs of .
Death had been pail, and that this would be no-
thing too like the'firit. But when the Maf'ter him~
felf came by me, as I faid jufl' now, and {aid we
ihould be all loft, I was dreadfully frightedf' I got
up out of my Cabbin, and look'd out; but fuch a
difmal Sight '1 never faw: The Sea went Mountains
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi~
nutes: When I could look about, I could fee no-
thing but Diitrefs round us: Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Mafls by the
Board, being deep loaden; and our Men cry'd out,
that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us
was i'oundered. Two more Ships being driven from
their Anchors, were'run out of the Roads to Sea,
,at all Adventures, and that with not a Mail fiand-- '
ing. The light Ships fared the belt, as not (0 much
labouring in the Sea; but two or three of them,
drove, and came clofe by us, running. away with
only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind. .
Towards Evening the Mate and 'Boatfwain
begg'd the Mafier of our Ship to let them cut a-
way the Fore--mafi, which he was very unwilling
to : But the Boatfwain prorefiing to him, that if he
did not, the Ship would founder, heconfented 5
and when they had cut away'the Fore-mall, the
Main--malt {food {0 loofe, and {hook the Ship [0
much, they were obliged to cut her away alfo, and
make a clear Deck.
.. Any one may judge what a Condition I muit be
in at all this, who was but a young Sailor, and
who had been in Inch 2. Fright before at but a lit-
tle. But if I can exprefs at this Dillance the
' - Y, Thoughtsl I 2: ]
Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
tenfold more Horror of Mind upon Account of my
former Convie'tions, and the having r-ettiriietl"f1'om
them to the RefolutionsI had wickedly taken at firfl,
than I was at Death it felf; and thcfe added to the
Terror of the Storm, put me into fuch a Condition,
that I can by no words delcribe it. But the worfl
was not come yet, the Storm continued with {ugh
Fury, that the Seamen themfelves acknowledged
they had never known a worfe. We had a good Ship,
but {he was deep loaden, and wallbwed in the Sea,
that the Seamen every now and then cried out, {he
WOuld founder. It was my advantage in one rei'peet,
that I did not know what they meant by F (Sunder,
tillI enquir'd. However, the Storm was {0 vie?
lent, that I faw, what is not often feen, the Mailer,
the Boatfwain, and fome others more {enfible than
the 1'33, at their Prayers, and expecting every Mo-
ment when the Ship would go to the Bottom. In
the Middle of the Night, and under all the refl: of
of our Difitelles, one of the Men that had been
down on Purpofe to fee, cried out we had 1})ng 3
Leak ; anorher {aid there was four Foot Water in
the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
At that very Word, my Heart, 2131 thought, died
within me, and I fell backwards upon the Side of
my Bed where I Tat, into the Cabin. However,
the Men roufed me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to
pump as anOther; at which I Ilirr'd up, and, went
to the Pump and work'd very heartily. Whilcthis
was dOng, the Mailer feeing fome light Colliers,
who notable to ride out the Storm, were Oblig'd
'0 flip and run away to Sea, and would come near
118, order'd to" fire a Gun as a Signal of Diflrefs. I
who knew nothing what that meant, was (0 fin'pri'

zed, thatI thought the Ship had broke, or form:
dreadi{~13 l

dreadful thing had happen'd. In sword, I was {0
fin-prized, that I'fell down in' 3 Simon As this
was a, time when every Body had his own Life to
think of, no Body minded me, or what was become
of me ; but anorher Man ltept up to the Pump, and
thrulting me afide with his Foot, let me lye, think-
ing I had been Dead; and it was 2. great while
before I came to my Elf. '

We work'd on, but the Water enereafing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the'Ship would founder,
and tho' the Storm began to abate a, little, yet as
it was not pollible {he cauld [wimtill we mightru'n
into "a Port, {0 the Mallet continued firing Guns for
Help 5 and a light Ship who had rid it out julta
Head of us, ventured a. Boat out to help us. It was
with the utmol't hazard the Boat came-near us, but
it was impoflible for us to get on Board, or for the
Boat to lie near the Ship Side, tillat la& the Men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to
fave ours, our Men call them a. Rope over the Stem
with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great
Length, which they after great Labour and Hazard
took hold of, and we hawl'd them clofe under our
Stern and got all into their Bout. It was to no
Purpofe for them or us after we were in the Boat to
think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all. agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
Shore as much as we 'could, and our Mallet pro-
miftd them, That it the Boat was lhrv'd upon
Shore he would make it good to their Mailer, f0
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went 3:-
wayto the Northwatd, flouping towards the Shore
almoll as far as lVimerraiz-MJS ,

We were not much more than a quarter of an-
Hour out of our Ship but we law he: link, and

ledge .I'had hardly Eyes to look up when the Sea--
men told me {he was linking; for from that MO'
ment they rather put me, into the Boat than that I
might be faid to go in, my Heart was as it were
dead within me,' partly with Fright, partly with
Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was
yet. before me. _- . _

While we Were in this CondiinH, the M611 yet

labonring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the
Shore, -we could fee, when our Boat mounting t/Je
Waves, we' were aele to fee any thing, a great many
People running along the Strand t0 affiff us when
we {hould come near, but we made but flow way
towards the Land, nor were we able to- reach the
Shore, till being pail the Light-Houfe at Warm",-
the Coalt falls off to the Wefiward towards Crome'r,
and fo the Land broke off a little the Violence of
.'the. Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not without
much Difficulty got all fafe on Shore, and walk'd
afterwards on Foot to Tarmouzla, where, as unfor-
tunate Men, we were ufed with great Humanity;
as well by the Magiflrates of the Town, who"
aflign'd us good (Zuarters, as by particular hier-
chants and Owners of Ships, and had Money gi-.
ven us fufficient to carry us either to London, or back
to Hall, as we thought fit. . .
' HadI now had the Senfe to have gone back to
Hall, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my Father, an Embleme of our blefled Saviour's Pa-
rable, had even kill'd the fatted Calf for me 5 for
hearing the Ship I went away in, was call away in
Tarmoutl) Road, it was a great While before he had
any Afl'urance that I was nor droWn'd.

But my ill Fate pufh'd me on now with an Ob-
_{l:inacy that norhing could refill ; and tho' I had fc~
(veral times loud Cal-ls from my Reafon and my

more compoled Judgment to go home, yet I had
noI I 5 I ,
ho Power to do it. I know not what to call this, not
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling Decree
that hurries-us on to be the Inflruments ofour own
Deflruaion, even tho' it. be before us, and that we
pufh upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly no--
thing but fome fuch decreed unavoidable Mifery
attending, and which it was impofliblle for me to,
efcape, could have puih'd me forward againfi the
calm Reafonings and Perfuafions of my moi} re-
tired Thoughts, and againit tWo fuch vifible In--i-
flzruetions as I had met with it my firPc Attempt.-
My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me be-
fore, and who was the Mafier's Son, was now lefs
forward than I 5 the firfl time he {poke to me after
we were at Turmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were feparated in the Town
to feveral,Quarters 5 I lay, the firit time he [aw me,
it appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very
melancholy, and fliaking his Head, ask'd me how
I did, and telling his Father WhoI Was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Trial, in order
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Young Man, '
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought
to take this for a plain and roiflhle Wheat/mt you are
not to he a Seafarz'ng Man. Why, Sir, {aid I, will you
go to Sea no morre;_?%e;Z'/yat _z's another Cafi, {aid he,

given you ofwhat you are to expefl if you per 1/25 perhaps
this 2': all hefah'eu u: on your Account, like onah in the
Ship ofTarihifh. Pray, continues he, what are you .2
And on what Account did you go to Sea? Upon that I
told him fome of my Story ,- at the End of which he
burfl: out with a flrange kind ofPaHion, What had
I done, fays he, that fuch an unhappy Wretch {hould
come into my Ship,- I would not fer my Foor in
the
the fame Ship with thee again For a thOui'and
Pounds. This indeed was, as I faid, an Excurfion
-of his Spirits which were yet agitated by the Senfe
of his Lois, and was farther than he COUld have
Authority to' go. HoWever he afterWards talk'd very
gravly to me exhorted me to go back to my Fa--
ther, and not tempt'Providence to' my Ruin; t01d
me I might fee a vifible Hand of Heaven againlt

thing but Dijhflers and Dzfizppoimmenty, til/your Fat/m":

We parted {oon after ,- for I made him little
Anfwer, and I {aw him no more; which way he
went, I know not. As for me, having fome Mo-
my in my Pocket, I travelled to Landon by Land;
and there, as well as on the Road, had many Strug~
gles' with my (elf, what Courfe of Life, I flJould take,
' and whether I {hould go Home, or go to Sea. .

As to going Home, Shame Oppofed the belt
Motions that offered to .my Thoughts 5 and it ini--
mediately occurr'd to me howl {honld be laugh'd
at among the Neighbours, and fhould be alham'd
rqfee, not my Father and Morher only, but even
every Body elfe; from whence I have finc'e often
obferved, how incongruous and irrational the com~
mon Temper of Mankind is, efpecially of Youth,
to that Reafon which ought to guide them in fuch
Cafes, viz. That they are alham'd to fin, and
yet are aiham'd to repent; not afham'd of the A8ti-'
on for which they ought juftly to be efleemed F 0013,
but are aflram'd of the returning, which only can
make them be efleem'd wife Men.

In this State of Life, however, I remained fon'ie
time, uncertain what Meafures to take, and what
Coutl'e of Life to lead. An irrefii'tible Relue'cancc.
eontinu'd to going Home; and as Iflay'd a while,

the[I7]

the Remembrance of the Diltrefs I had been in '
wore oi'f ; and as that abated, the little Motion I
had in my Defires to a Return wore off with it, till
at lair I quite laid afide the Thoughts of it, and
look'd out for a Voyage. '

That evil Influence which carried me firf't away
from my Father's Hetife, that hurried me into the
wild and indigel'ted Notion of raifing my'Fortune;
and that imprefi thofe Conceits {o {Oi-ciby upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and
to the Entteaties, and even Command of my Fa-
ther: I fay, the fame Influence, whatever it was,
prefe'nted the molt unfortunate of all Enterprizes
to my View 5 and I went on Boarda Vellel bound
to the Coal't of Africa; or as our Sailors vulgarly
call it, a Voyage to Gurney,

It was my great Misfortune that in all thefe
Adventures I did not ihip my {elf as a Sailor;
whereby, tho' indeed I might have work'd a. little
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had
learn'd the Duty and Office of a F ore--mail: Man;
and in time might have qualify'd my {elf fora
Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a_ Mailer. But as
it 'was always my Fate to choofe for the worfe,
fo I did here; for having Money in my Pocket,
and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would always
go on Board in the Habit of a Gentleman ; and {o
Ineithet had any Bulinefs in the Ship, 0!: learn'd
to do any. - .

It was my Lot firlt of all to fall into pretty good
Company in London, which does not always help
pen to luch loofe and unguided young Fellows as I
then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay
{ome Snare for them very early : But it was not fo
with me, I firli Fell acquainted with the Mailer of
a Ship who had been on the Coaft of Guiney ; and _
who having had Very good Sitccefs there, was re-

C '[olved
folved to go again 3 and who taking a Fancy to my
Converfation, which was not at all difagreeable at
that time, hearing me fay I had a mind to fee the
World, told me, if I wou'd go the Voyage with
him I fhould be at no Expense 5 I fhould be his
Mefs--mate and his Companion, and if I could car-
ry any Thing with me, I fhould have all the Ad-
Vantage of it that the Trade would admit; and
perhaps I might meet with {ome Encouragement.
I embrae'd the Offer, and entring into a firie't
Friendfhip with this Captain, who was an honefi:
and plain--dealing Man, I went the Voyage with
him, and carried a {mall Adventure with me, which
by the difinterel'ced Honel'cy of my Friend the Cap~
min, I increafed very confiderably ; for I carried a-
bout 4o 1. in fuch Toys and Trifles as the Captain
directed me to buy. This 40 Z. I had muflered to-

gether by the Afiiliance of {ome of my Relations

whom I correfponded with, and who, I believe,
got my Father, or at leaflt my Mother, to contri'
hate [0 much as that to my firPc Adventure.

This was the only Voyage which I may lay was
luccefsful'in all my Adventures, and which I owe to
the Integrity and Honefiy of my Friend the Cap-
tain, under whom alfo I got a competent Know-
ledge of the Mathematicks and the Rules of Na-
vigation, learn'd how to keep an Account of the
Ship's Courfe, take an Obfervation ; and in lhort,
to underfland fome Things that were needfill to be
underflood by a'Sailor: For, as he took Delight to
introduce me, I took Delight to learn ; and, in a
Word, this. Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant: For I brought Home L. 5. 9 Game: of
Gold Duff for my Adventure, which yielded me in
London, at my Return, almolt 3:00 1. and this fill'd

' me with thofe afpiring Thoughts which have finee

fo compleated my Ruin.

[I9]

Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes
mo ; particularly, that I was continually lick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the excelIive
Heat of the Climate,- our principal Trading being
upon the Coal}, from. the Latitude of 15 Degrees,
North even to the Line it felf.

I was now {et up for a Game)! finder ; and my
Friend, to my great Misfortune, dying foon after his
Arrival, I refolv'd to go the fame Voyage again,
and I emba'rk'd in the fame Veffel with one who was
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now go:
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap-
pielt Voyage that ever Man made ; for tho' I did
not carry quite 100 l. of my new gain'd Wealth,
[0 that I had 2001. left, and which I lodg'd with
my Friend's Widow, who was very jufl to me, yet
I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage; and

' the firlt Was this, viz" Our Ship making her Courfe

towards the Camrylllands, or rather between thofe
Illands and the" (firiam Shore, was furprized in the
Grey of the Morning, by a Turkzfi Rover ofSallee, '
who gave Chafe to us with all the Sail {he could
make. We crowded alfo as much Canvafs as our
Yards would (plead, or our Malls carry, to have
gor clear ; but finding the Pirate gain'd upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few
Hours, we prepar'd to fight ; our Ship having I2
Guns, and the Rogue 18. About three in the Af-
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing too by
Mifiake, jui't athwart our Quarter, infl-ead of a-
thwart out Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of
our_Guns to bear on that Side, and pour'd in a.
Broadlide upon him, which made him [beer of a-- -
gain, after returning our Fire, and pouring in alfo
his final] Shor from near 200 Men which he had on '
Board. However, we had nor a Man touch'd, all
our Men keeping clofe. He prepar'd to attack us
. C 2 again[20]

again, and'w'e to defend our felves; but laying 115
on Board the next time upon out Other Quarter,
he entet'd fixty Men upon our Decks, who imme"
diately fell to cutting and hacking the Decks 21116}
Rigging. We-ply'd them with Small--(hot, Halt'
Pikes, Powder-Chefts, and {uch like, and clear'd
our Deck of them twice. HOWt'V'cra '50 cm: fhort
this melancholy Part of our Story, _0"f 311i? b61113
difabled, and three of our Men killid) and eight
wounded, we were obliged toyielch and were Car"
ry'd all Prifoncrs into Sallee, a Port belonging t0
the Moors. - .

The U (age Ihad there was nor {0 dreadful as at
firfll apprehended, nor was I carried "P the Coun'
try to the Emperor's Court, as the relt of our Men
were, but was kept by the Captain 0f the ROVCF:
as his proiwcr Prize, and made his $lave, being
yOung and nimble, andfit for his Buhnefs. At this
ihrprizing Change of my Circumflances from a
Merchant to a miferable Slave, I was perfefily o-
verwhelmed ; and now I look'd back upon my F a~
ther's pmpherick Difcourfe to me, that I ihould be
miferable, and have none to relieve me, whichI
thought was now {0 efl'eclually brought to pafs, that
it could nor be wori'e; that now the Hand of Hea-
\'rcn had overtaken me, and I was undone without
Redemption. But alafis! this was but a. Tafle of
the Mifery I was to go rhro', as will appear in the
Sequel of this Story.

. As my new Parron or Mailer had taken me Home
. to his Houfe, {o I was in Hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to Sea. again, believ-
ing that it would {ome time or other be his Fate
to be taken by a Apzmi/b or Partugal Man of War ;
and that then I ihould be l'et at Liberty. But this
Hope oF mine was foon taken away ; for when he
{rent to Sea, he left me on Shore to look after his

- little
little Garden, and do the common Drudgery of
Slaves about his Houfe ,- and when he came Home
again from his Cruife, he order'd me to lie in thfi
Cabin to look after the Ship. '

Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape ; and
what Method Imight take to effect it, but found
no Way that had the lealt Probability in it : No-
thing prefented to make the Suppofition of it Ira-'-
tional; for I had no Body to communicate it to,
that would embark with me; no F ellow--Slave, no
Englifl: Man, Iii/7) Man, or Scotch Man there but my
felf; fo that for two Yeats, tho' I often pleafed my
{elf with the Imagination, yet I never had the lealt
encouraging Profpeet of putting it in Practice.

After about two' Years, an odd Circumftance
prefented it felf, which put the old Thought of
making fome Atttempt for my Liberty, again in
my Head: My Patron lying at Home longer than
ufual, without fitting out his Ship, which,'as I
heard, was for want of Money ; he ufed conltant-
ly, once or twice a Week, fometimes oftner, if the
Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and
go out into the Road a fifhing 5 and as he always
took me and a young Mfli'C'fCO with him to row the
Boat, we made him very merry, and I prov'd very
dexterous in catching Fiihg infomuch that {ome-
times he would fend me with a Moor, one of his
Kinfmcn, and the Youth the Mam/co, as they call'd
him, to catch a Diih of Filh for him.

It happen'd one time, that going a fifhing in a
{faith calm Morning, a Fog role {0 thick, that tho'
we were not half a League from the Shore we loft
Sighrof it; and towing we knew not whither or
which Way, we labour-'d all Day and all the next
Night, and when the Morning came we found we
had pull'd off to Sea inflead of pulling in for the
Shore 5 and that we were at Icalt two Leagues from

C 3 the

\[.221

the Shore: However, we got Well in, again, then
with agreat deal of Labour, and fome Danger;
for the "Wind began to blow pretty freih in the
Morning; but particularly we were all very hungry,

But our Patron, warn'd by this Difalier, refolved
to take more Care of himfclf for the future ; and
having lying by him the Long-Boat of our Englz'jl,
Ship they had taken, he refolved he. would nor go
a fifliing any more without a Compafs and fome
Provifion; {0 he ordered the Carpenter of his
Ship, who alfo was an Engli/b Slave, to build alit~
tle State-Room or Cabin in the middle of the
Long--Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place to
{land behind it to fleet and hale home the Main~
fleet; and Room before for a Hand or- two to
fraud and work the Sails? She {ail'd with that We
call a Shoulder of Mutton Sail; and the Boom
gib'd over the Top of the Cabin, which'lay very
{nng and low, and'had in it Room for him to liea
with aSlave or two, and a Table to eat on, with
{ome finall Lockers to put in {ome Bottles offueh
Liquor as he thought fit to drink; particularly
his Bread, Rice and Coffee.

We went frequently out with this Boat 3 fifliing,
and as I was molt dextrous to catch F iih for him,
he never went without me: It'happen'd that he
had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleahlte or for Fifh, with two .or three Mar: of
fome Dilli'naion in that Place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore
fent on Board the Boat over Night, a larger Store
of Provifions than ordinary 5 and had 'order'd me
to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shor,
which were on Board his Ship; for that they de-
fign'd fome Sport of Fowling as well as Fiihing.

I got all Things ready as he had dirceted, and -
,waited the next Morning with the Boat, waihed

' clean,I 23 3 ,

clean, her Antient and Pendants. out, and every
thing to accommodate his Guefis; when by and
by my Patron came on Board alone, and told me
his GuePrs had put ofi going, upon fome Bulinefs
that fell out, and order'd me with the Man and
Boy, as ufual, to go out with the Boat and catch
them {ome Fifli, for that his Friends were to {up'
at his Houl'e ; and commanded that as (con as}
had got {ome Fiih I fliould bring it home to his
Houfe; all which I prepar'd to do. _

This Moment my former Notions of Deliver-
ance darted into my Thoughts, for now I foundI
was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and
my Maiter being gone, I prepar'd to furnilh my
felf, not for a fifhing Bufinefs, but for a Voyage 3
tho' I knew not, neither did I {0 much as confider
whither I fliould Freer,- for any where to get out
of that Place was my Way.

My firfi Ce'ntrivance was to make a Pretence to .
{peak to this Moor, to get fomething for our Sub-- -' "
fifience on Board; for I told him we muit not pre-
fume to eat of our Patton's Bread; he (aid, that.
was true 3 {0 he brought a large Basket of Rusk
or Bisket' of their kind, and three Jarrs with freflx
Water into the Boat ; I knew where my Patton's
Cafe of Bottles flood, which it was evident by
the Make were taken out of (ome Engli J Prize; and
I convey'd them into the Boat while the Mbor was,
on Shore, as if they had been there before, for our-
Mafler: _I convey'd alfo a great Lump of Bees~
Wax into the Boat, which weighed above halfa,
hundred Weight, with a Parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, :3 Saw, and a Hammer, all
which were of great Ufe to us afterwards: cfpe-
cially the Wax to make Candles, Another Trick
Itry'd upon him, which he innocently came, into.

<<info; his Name was Ifmael, who they call .Mzzl)',
C 4 ' or
or Moely, lo I call'd to him, Moely faid I, out Fae
tron's Guns are on Board the Boat, can yOu not
get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may
kill fome Alcamie: (a Fowl like our Culiem) for our
felves, forI know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in
the Ship? Yes, lays he, I'll bring -fome, and ac-
cordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch which
held about a Pound and half of Powder, or rather
more; and another with Shot, that had five or fix
Pound, with fome Bullets; and put all into the
Boat : At the fame time I had found {ome Powder.
of my Mafier's in the great Cabin, with which I
fill'd one of the large Bottles in the Cafe, which
was almoi't empty; pouring what was in it into a<<
norher: And thus furnilhcd with every thing need--
PS111,er fail'd out of" the Port to filh : The Callie,
'which is at the Entrance ofthe'Port, knew who we
were, and took no Notice of us 5 and we were not
above a Mile out of the Port before we hal'd in Our
Sail, and {at us down to fiih : The Wind blew
from the N. NE. which was contrary to my Defire ;
for had it blown Southcrly, I had been {are to have
made the Coal} of Spain, and at leaft rcach'd to the
Bay of Cadzz; but my Refolutions were, b10w
which way it would, i w0uld be gone from that
horrid Place where I was, and leave the reft to Fate.
frer we had fifli'd {ome time and catch'd no-
thing, for when I had Filh on my Hcok, I would.
not pull them up, that he might not fee them 5 I laid
to the Moor, this will not do, our Mailer will nor
be thus ferv'd, we mull {land farther off: He think~ '
ing no Harm agreed, and being in the Head of the
Boat (er the Sails; and as ,I-had the Helm I run
the Boat out near a League farther, and then
brought her too as if I wohld' fifh, when giving
the Boy the Heim, Illept forward to where the
Moor was, and making as if I {loopid for" fame--
' thing
thing behind him, Itook him by furprize with
my' Arm under his T will, and toil him clear o~
vet board into the Sea 5 he rife immediately, for
he fwam like a Cork, and call'd tome, begg'd to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the World
with me,- he {warn Io firong after the Boat that he
would have reach'd me very quickly, there being but
little Wind; upon which I flept into the Cabin,
and Fetching one of the F owling-pieces, I prefented
it at him, and told him, Iliad done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet I would do him none: But
{aid I, you fwim well enough to reach the
Shore, and the Sea is calm, make the befi of your
Way to Shore and I will do you no harm, but if
you come near the Boat I'll {boat you thro' the
Head ; forI am refolved to have my Liberty ; [0
he tutn'd himfelf about and [warn for the Shore,
and I make no doubt but he tcaCh'd it with Eafe,
for he was an excellent Swimmer. .

I could have'be'en content to ha' taken this Moor
with me, and ha' drown"d the Boy, but there was no
venturing to truii him: When he was gone I turn'd
to the Boy, who they call'd Xury, and {aid to
him, Xm-y, if you will be faithful to me I'll make
you a great Man, but if you will. not fitoak your
Face to be true to me, that is, fware byMahomet and
' bis Elt/Jer's' Beard, I mull throw you into the Sea
too; the Boy fmil'd in my Face and {poke lb inno-
cently that I could no: mifi'rufi him 5 and-{wore to
be faithful to me, and go all over the World with
me. .
While I was in View of the [War that was
fwimming, I flood out dircftl y to Sea with the Boat,
rather {itetching to Windward, that they might
think me gone towards the Straits--mouth (as indeed
,' any one that had been in theirWits mui't ha' been {up-
' pos'd to do)fotwho would ha' fuppos'd we were iail'd

' ' on
on to the Southward to the truly Etzrearz'an Coaii,
where whole Nations of Negroes were fure to fur--
round us with their Canoes, and deflroy US;
where we could ne'er once gone on Shore but we
ihould be devour'd by favage Beafis or more met-
cilefs Savages of human kind.

But as foon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I
chang'd my Courfe, and fleer'd direfi'ly South and
a by Eai't, bending my Conrfe a little toward the-
Bait, that I might keep in with the Shore; and
having a fair frefl1 Gale of Wind, and finooth quiet
Sea, I made fuch Sail that I believe by the next
Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when I
firit made the Land, I could nor be-lefs than 150
Miies South of Sallee ; quite beyond the Emperor
of Morocco's Dominions, or indeed of any other
King thereabouts, for we law no People. '

Yet fuch was the Fright I had taken at the Moon,
and the dreadful Apprehenlions I had of falling in-
to their Hands, that I would not flop, or go on.
Shore, or come to an Author; the Wind continu-.
ing fair, 'till I had fail'd in that manner five Days :
And then the Wind 'ihifting to the Southward; I
concluded alfo that if any of our Vcflels were in
Chafe of me, they alfo would now give over; f0.
I ventur'd to make to the Coal}, and came to an
Anchorin the Mouth of a little River, I knew noz:
what, or where; neither what Latitude, what
Country, what Nation, or what River: Ineither
faw, or defir'd to ice any People, the principal thing
Iwanted was freih Water: We came into this
Creek in the Evening, refolving to fwim on Shore
as foon as it was dark, and difcover the Country;
- but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch
dreadful Noifes of the Barking, Roaring, and
' Howling of wild Creatures of we knew not what
Kinds, that the poor Boy was ready to die with

F ear,~l27l

Fear and begg'd of me nor to go on Shore till
Day; well Xury, faid I, then I won't, but it may
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad to
us as thofe Lyons 5 then we give them the [boat Gun,
fays Xm'y, laughing, maize the>>: ram 'wcy ; fuch Engli 2
Xury {poke by con'verfing among us Slaves, howe-
ver I was glad to fee the Boy {0 cheerful, andI
gaVe him a Dram (out of our Patton's Cafe of Bot-
tles) to cheat him up: After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we dropp'd ouriittle An-
chor' and lay fiill all Night; I fay fiill, for we'flept
none; for in two or three Hours we {aw vait great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of
many forts, come down to the Sea-fliore and run in-
to the Water, wallowing and wafhing themfelves
for the Pleafure of cooling themfelves: and they
made fuch hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed {0 was
Itoo; but 'wewere- both more frighted when we
heard one of thefe mighty Creatures come {wim-
ming towards our Boat, we could not fee him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
i'trous, huge and furious Beai't; Xury {aid it was a
Lyon, and it might be [0 for ought I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weight the Anchor and
tow away; no, {aid I, me, we can flip our Cable
with the Buoy to it and go OPE to Sea, they cannot:
follow us far; I had no fooner {aid [0, butI per-
ceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within two
Oars length, which fomething furprized me; how--
ever I immediately flept to the Cabin--door, and
taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon which be im-
mediately turn'd about and fwam towards the
Shore again. " .

But it is impomble to defcri be the horrible Noi-
Ies, and hidious Cries and Howlings, that were

' taifed '
taifed as well upon the Edge of the Shore, as high-
er within the Country; upon the Noife 01: Re-
port of the Gun, a 'I'hingl have fome Reafon to
believe thofe Creatures had never heard .before :
This convinc'd me that there was no going on
Shore for us in the' Night upOn that Coal}, and
how to venture on Shore in the Day was another
-Quellion too 3 for to have fallen into the Hands
, of any of the Savages, had been as bad as to
'haVeetefien into the Hands of Lyons and Ty--

. rs; Sleali we were equally apprehenfive of the

firings; of it.

"Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on
Shore fomewhere or Other For Water, for we had
not a Pint left in the Boat; when or where to get to
it was the Point : Xary {aid, il'I would let him go
on Shore with one of the Jars, he would'find ii there -
was any Water and bring fome to me. Iask'd
him why he would go? Why I fliould not go ,and
he flay in the Boat? The Boy anfwet'd with {0
much Afieetion, that made me love him ever
after; Says he, If~tvi1d [Want come, they eat me, you
go the}. Well, Mary, {aid I, we will both go, and
if the wild Mans come, we will kill them, they
lhall eat neither of us,- (0 I gave X507 3 piece of
Rusk-bread to eat, and a Dram out of our Pa-
tton's Cafe of Bottles which I. mentioned before ;
and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shore as we
thought was preper, and waded on Shore; car-
rying norhing but our Arms, and two Jarrs for
Water. -

Idid not care to go out of Sight of the Boat,
fearing the coming of Canoes with Savage;
down the River; But the Boy {eeing a low Place
about aMilc up the Country rambled to it; and
hy and by} law him come running towards me,
I thought he was purlucd hy- {Qme Savage, 9;,-

trighted
frighted with fome wild Beaft, and I run forward
towardhim to help him, but when I came nearer
to him, I {aw fomething hanging over his Shoul-
ders which was a Creature that he had (hot, like a,
Hare but different in Colour, and longer Legs,
however we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat; but the great Joy that -poor me
came with, was to tell me he had found good W -
ter and feen no wild Many.

But we found afterwards that we need not take
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we where, we found the Water frefh
when the Tide was out, which flowed but a little
way up; fo we filled our Jarrs and feafted oh the
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, having feen no Font-lteps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.

'As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before,
I knew very well that the Illands of the Canaries,
and the Cape de Verd Iflands alfo, lay not far off
from the Coai't. But 2131 had no Infiruments to
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude we
Were in, and nor exactly know, or at lead to re~
member what Latitude they were in; I knew not
where to look for them, or when to ftand off to Sea.
towards them 5 orherwife I might now eafily have
found fome ofthefe Iflands. But my hopes was,
that if I flood along this Coafl till I came to that
Part where the EngZi/l: traded, I thould find fome of
their Vcflels upon their ufual Defign of Trade,
that would relieve and take us in.

By the bell: ofm y Calculation, that Place where
I now was, mull be that Country, which lying be-
tween the Emperor of [Morocco's Dominions and the
Mgroer, lies wait and uninhabited, except by wild
Beafis; the Mgroer having abandon'd it and gone
farther South for fearof the Moor: ,- and the. Moors

not
not thinking it Worth inhabiting, by reafon of its
Barrennefs; and indeed both forfaking it becaufe
of the prodigious Numbers of T ygers, Lyons,
Leopards, and other furious Creatures which hat-
bour there; {0 that the [Moors ufe it for their Hun-
ting only, where they go like an Army, two or three
thoufand Men at a Time; and indeed for near an
' hundred Miles tooether upon this Coail, w'e faw
nothing buta waii uninhabited Country, by Day;
and: heard nothing but Howlings" and Roaring of
wild Beafis, by Night.

Once or twice in the Day time, I thought I {aw
the Pica of Temrife, being the high top of the
Mountain finerg'fe in the Canaries; and hada great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice I was forced in again by
contrary Winds, the Sea alfo going too high for my
little Veifel, (0 I refolved to purfue my firfl: Defign
'and keep along the Shore.

Several times I was obliged toland for frefh Wae
ter, after we had left this Place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the Morning, we came to
an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was
pretty high, and the Tidebeginning to flow, we
lay {till to go farther in ; Xury, whofe Eyes were
more about him then it feems mine were, calls {oft--
ly to me, and tells me that we had bell gofarthet
off the Shore; for, {ays he, look yonder lies a
dreadful Monfler on 'the Side of that Hiliock fall
afleep : I look'd where he pointed, and law a
dreadful Monfler indeed, forit was aterrible great
Lyon that lay on the Side of the Shore, under the
Shade of a Piece of the Hill that hung as it were a
little over him. Xury, laid I, you {hall go ouShore
and kill him; Xm-y look'd frighted, and faid,
Me lei/ll be eat me at one Mouth; one Mouthful he
meant; however, Ifaid no more to the Boy, but

bad
bad him lye ftill, and I took our biggeli Gun,
which was almoft Musket-bore, and loaded it with
a good Charge of Powder, and with two Slugs,
and laid it down; then I loaded another Gun with
two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pie-
ces, I loaded with five {mallet Bullets. I took the
belt Aim I could with the firit Piece to have {hot
him into the Head, but he lay {o with his Leg
rais'da little above his Nofe, that the Slugs hit
his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He
i'carted up growling at firfi, but finding his Leg broke
fell down again, and then got up upon three Legs,
and gave the molt hideous Roar that ever I heard ;
I was a little furpriz'd that I had not hit him on
the Head; however I took up the fecond Piece im-
mediately, and tho' he began to move off firid a~
gain, and {hot him into the Head, and had the
Pleafure to fee him drop, and make but little Noife,
but lay firuggling for Life. Then Xary took Heart,
and wOuld have me let him go on Shore: Well, go
faid I ; ~fo the Boy jump'd into the Water, and ta--
king a little Gun in one Hand, fwam to Shore with
the other Hand, and coming clofe to the Creature,
put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Bar, and {hot
him into the Head again, which difpatch'd him'i;

mite.
q This was Game indeed to us, but this was n6 _'
Food, and I was very forty to lofe three Charges of
Powder and Shor upon a Creature that was good
for norhing to us. However, Xury (aid, he would
have fome of him; fo he comes on board, ask'd
me to give him the Hatchet; for what, Xury, {aid
I? Macart of lair Head, .{aid he. However, Xary
could nor cut off his Head, but he cut ofF a Foot
and brought it with him, and it wasa monflrons
great one. - .

I be-E 32 l

I bethought my {elf however, that perhaps the;
Skin of him might one way or other he of fame
Value to us ; and I refolved to take off his Skin if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him 5
but Xury was much the better Workman at it, for I
knew very ill how to doit. Indeed it took us up
borh the whole Day, but at 1219: we go: off the
Hide of him, and fpreading it on the top of our
Cabin; the Sun effectually dried it in two Days
time, and it afterwards ferv'd me to lye upon.

After this Stop we made on to the Southward
continually for tenor twelve Days, living very
{paring on our Provifions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftner into the Shore than
we were oblig'd to for frelh Water; my Delign in
this was to make the River Gambia or Senegal], that
is to fay, any where about the Cape (/2 Wm], where
1-was in hopes to meet with fome European Ship,
and if Idid not, I knew not What Com-fe'I had
to take, but to feek for the 'I/Zandr, or perifh there
among the Mgraer. I knew that all the Ships from
Europe, which fail'd either to the Coaii of Guiney,
or to Bra/ii, or to the Enfl-dez'er, made this Cape,
or thofe Iflrmd: 5 and in a word, I put the whole
ofmy Fortune anon this (high: Point, either that I
mufl: meet with fome Ship, or innit perilh. '

*Whe'n Ihad purfiied this Refolution about ten
Days longer, as I have laid, I began to ice that.
the Land was inhabited, and in two or three
Places as we failed by, we {aw People Hand upon
the Shore to look at us, we could allo perceive
they were quite Black and Stark--naked. I was once
inclin'd to have gone on Shore to them ; but Xm-y
was my better Connl'ellor, and {aid to me, nogo,
720 go; however Ihawl'd in nearer the Shorc that I
might talk to them, and I- ionnd they run alorg
the'Shore byime a good way ; I obferv'd they had
no
no Weapons in their Hands, except one who had a
long flender Stick, which Xury {aid was a Lance,
and that they would throw them a great way With
good Aim; foI kept at a dilianc'e, but talk'd with
them by Signs as well as I could ; and particularly
made Si us for fomething to eat, they beckon'd to
me to got, my Boat, and they would fetch me
fome Meat; upon this Ilower'd the top of my
Sail, and lay by, and two of'them run up into the
Country, and in lefs than half an Hour came back,
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Fleih
and fome Corn, {uch as is the Produce of their
Country; but we neither knew what the one or the
orhet was; however we were willing to accept it,
but how to come at it was our next Difpute, for I
was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they
were as much afi'taid of us; but they took a fare
way for usall, for they brought it to the Shore and
laid it down, and went flood a great way off
till we fetch'd it. on Board, and then came clofe to
us again.

We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends ; but an Opportuni~
ty offer'd that every Infiant to oblige them wone
derfully, for while we were lying by the Shore,
'came two miohty Creatures, one purfuing the Other,
( as we took it with great Fury, from the Mountains
towards the Sea; whether it was the Male purfuing
, the Female,or whether theywere in Sport or in Rage,
we could :10: tell, any more than we could tell whe-
ther it was ufual or ftrange, buthelieveit was the
latter; became in the firit Place, thofe ravenous
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night; and in
the fecond Place, we found the People terribly
frightcd, efpecially the Women. The Man that
had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them,
but the reit did ; however as the two Creatures

D 1'3 l1
ran direetly into the Water, they did not feem to of:
far to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plung'd
themfelves into the Sea and {warn about as if
they'liad come for their Diverlion ; at lait one of
them began to come nearer our Boat than at firfl I
exp eel ed, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my Gun with all poflible Expedition, and bad Xury
load borh the other; as [con as he came fairly with--
in my reach, I fir'd, and ihot him diree'cly into the
Head 5 immediately he funk dov'vn into the Water,
but rofe inftantly and plung'd up and down as if
he was firuggling for Life 5 andfo indeed he was,
he immediately made to the Shore, but between
the Wound which was his mortal Hurt, and the
flranglin'g of the Water, he dyed jufl before he
reach'd the Shore. '

It is impoflible to exprefs the Aflonifliment of
thefe'poor Creatures at the Noife and the Fire of
my Guns; fome of them were even ready to dye
for Fear, and fell down as Dead with the very
Terror. But when they faw the Creature dead and
funk-in the Water, and that I made Signs to them
to come to the Shore; they took Heart and came

. to the Shore and began to learch for the Creature,

, Ifound him by his Blood llaining the Water, and
by the help of a Rope whichI flung round him
and gave the Magma- to haw], they drag'd him on
Shore, and Found that it was a moii curious Leo-
pard, (ported and fine to an admirable Degree, and
the .Negroes held up their Hands with Admiration
to think what it was I had kill'd him with.

The orher Creature frighted with the flaih of
Fire and the'Noife of the Gun fwam on Shore,
and ran up directly to the Mountains from whence
they came, nor could I at that Dillance know
what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for eating the Flefliof this Creature, {o I was wil-

ling
ling to have them take-it as a Favour from me
which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they were very thankful for, immediate"
1y they fell to work with him, and tho' they had no
Knife, yet with afllarpen'd piece of Wood they took
off his Skin as readily, and much more readily than
we cou'd have done with a Knife; they offer'd me
iome of the Flelh, which I declined, making as if
I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin,
which they gave me very freely, and brought me};
great deal more of their Provifion, which tho' I did
not underfiand, yetI accepted; then I made Signs
to them for fome Water, and held out one of my,
Jarrs to them, turning it Bettom upward, to fhew-
that it was empty, and that I wanted to- have it
filled. They call'd immediately to fome of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Vei'fel made of Earth, and burnt, as I {up-
pofe in the Sun 5 this they fet down for me, as be-
fore, and I [cut Xury on Shore with my Jarrs, and'
filled them all three. The Women were as fiark
naked as the Men.

I was now furnifhed with Roots and Corn, fuch
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne~'
grow, I made forward for about eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, till I (aw:
the Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at .
about the Difiance of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm, I kept a large
ofling to make this Point; at length, doubling the
Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I
{aw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward ;
then I concluded, as it was molt certain indeed,
that this W113}? I, ape dc Vie-rd, and thofe the I.
flzlizdj', ,. tgit-H71 from thence Cape ale Maul Iflmzdr,
However they were at a great Diflance, and I
eould not well tell what I had bell: to do, for iii

D 2 ' {hould{hould be taken with a Frelh of Wind I might:
"neither reacn one or other.

In this Dilemna, as 'I was very penfive, I flept
into the Cabin, and {at me down, Xary having
the Helm, when on a {udden the Boy cry'd out
Mafler, Zl/Iajier, a Ship wit]: a Sail, and the f'ooliih
. BOY was itighted out of his Wits, thinking it
mull needs be ionic of his Mafier's Ships fent to;
putfue us, when, I knew we Were gotten far enough
out of their reach. Ijump'd out of the Cabin,
and immediately law not only the Ship, but what
{he was, (721%.) that it was a Partugu fe Ship, and
as I thought was bound to the Coafi of Guinea for
Negroes But when 1' obfetv'd the Comic {he
fteer'd, I was foon convinc'd they were bound
fome Other way, and did "not defign to come any
nearer to the Shore; upon which I ilretch'd out to
Sea as much as I could, refolving to {peak with
them if poflible. '

' With all the Saill could make I found I ihould
not be" able to come in their Way, butthat they
{honld be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them; but after I had crowded to the utmoll,
and began to del'pair, they it feems {aw me by the
help of their Perfpeetive--Glafl'es, and that it was
fomc Em'ofefm Boat, which as they fuppofed mufi
Belong to fome Ship that was loll, {0 they {hort-.
ned Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged
with this, and as I had my Patron's Antient on
Board, 1 made a Wait of it to them for a Signal
of Difii'cfs, and fir'da Gun, both which they (aw,
for they << told me they {aw the Smoke, tho' they did
not heat the Gun; ' upon theie' Signals they very
kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in a-
bout three Hours time Icame up with them.
They ash'd me whatI was, in Portugueflz, audin
Spring/b, and in Rem/2, but I underflood noge of
t em 3.l 37 1
them; but a lafl a Scot: Sailor who was on board,
call'd to me, and I anfwer'd him, and told himI
was 'an EngliflJ Man, that I had made my efcape out
of Slavery from the Moor: at .S'al'ee ; then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my Goods. '

It was an inexprefiible Joy to me, that any one
will believe, that I was thus deliver'd, as I ePt-eem'd
it, from {uch a miferable and almol'thopelefs Con-
dition 2181 was in, and I immedfately offered all I
had to the. Captain of the Sh; p, as a Return for
my Deliverance ,' but he genemufly told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all Ihad
fllould be deliver'd fafe to me when Icame to the
Braflls 5 for, {ays he, [have fa-v'd your Life on no 0-
they-Term: than I would he glad to hejlwed myjelf, and
it may one time or other be my Lot to he taken up no the
fame Condition; hefider, {aid he, "when I carry you to
the Brafils, fl) great a way from your own Country, if I
jhoztld takefi'om you what you have, you will heflarrved
there, and then I only take am: y that Life I have given,-
No, no, Seignior, Inglefe, lays he, Mr. Englifhman,
I will carry you thither in Charity, and thofe things will
help'you to [my your Suhfiflame there, and your Pafl'tzge'
home again. .

As he was Charitable in his Propofal, f0 he was
jail in the Performance to a tittle, for he ordered
the Seamen,' that none fhould offer to touch any
thing I had; then he took every thing into his own
Pofl'elfion, and gave me back an exaft Inventory of
them, that I might have them, even f0 mnehas
my three Earthen Jarrs.

_ As to my Boat it was a very good One,- and
that he faw, and told me he would buy it of me
for the Ship's Ufe, and ask'd me what 1 would have
for it? Itold him he had been {0 generous to me
in every thing, that Ieould not offer to make a--

DS in;
. ny Price of the Boat, but left it entirely to him;
upOn which he told me he would give me-a Note
of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it
at Brafil, and when it came there, if any one of-
fer'd to give more he would make it up 5 he ofiZer'd
me alfo 60 Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury,
which I was loathto take, not that I was not wil-

ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loath to fell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had afli-
fied me Io faithfully in procuring my own. How-
ever when I let him know my Reafon, he own'd it
to be iufi, and offer'd me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to {et him free
in ten Years, if he turn'd Chrifiian; upon this,
and X2577} {aying he was willing to go to him, I
let the Captain have him. i

We had a very good Voyage to the Bra/1'13, and
arriv'd in 'the Ba} de 'To'do: lo: Santos, or All--Saints-
Bay, in about 22 Days after. . And now I was
once more deliver'd from the molt miierable of
all Conditions of Life, and what to do next with
my felf, I was now to confider.

The generous Treatment the Captain gave me,
Ican never enough remember; he would take no-
thing of me for my Pafl'age, gave me 20 Ducats
for-the Leopard's Skin, and 40 for the Lyon's Skin
which I had in my Boat, and caufed every Thing
I had in the Ship to be punetually deliver'd me,
and what Iwas willing to fell he bought, fuch as
the Cafe of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a'Piecc
of the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made Can-
dles of the tell; in a word, I made about 220
Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
Stock I went on Shore in the Bra/1'10.

Ihad'not been long here, but being recommen-
ded to the Houfe of a'good honeii Man like him-
felf, whohad an Ingeiizo as they call it 5 that is,-a -

- . Plan~Plantation, anda Sugar-Houfe. I liv'd with hini'
{ome Time, and acquainted myfelf by that Means
with the Manner of their planting and making of
Sugar; and feeing how "well the Planters liv'd, and
how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolv'd, if Icould
get Licence, to fettle there, Iwould turn Planter a-
mong them, refolving in the mean time to find out
fome way to get my Money, which I left in London,
remitted to me. To this Purpofe, getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchafed as much
Land that was uncur'd, as my Money would reach,
and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement,
and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock,
whichI pr0pos'd to myfelf to receive from England.

I had a Neighbour, a Portuguqfe of Lisbon, but

born of Engli/b Parents, whofe Name was Milt,
and in much fuch Circumi'cances asI was. 'I call
him my Neighbour, becaufe his Plantation lay next
to mine, and we went on very {ociabl y together. My
Stock was but low as well as'his; and we rather
planted for Food than any Thing elfe, for about two
Years. However, we began to cncreafe, and our
Land began to come into Order; fo that the third
Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of
us a large Piece ofGrotmd ready for planting Canes
in the Year to come ; but we both wanted Help;
and now I found more than before, I had done
wrong in parting with my Boy Xury.

But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right,
was no great Wonder: I had no Remedy but to
go on; Iwas gOtten into an Imployment quite re-
mote to my Genius, and directly contrary to the Life
I delighted in, and for which I forfook my Father's
Houfe, and broke thro' all his good Advice; nay,
I was coming into the very middle Station, or up--
per Degree of low Life, which my Father Advifed
me to before; and which, if I refolv'd to go on

D 4 with
with, I might as well ha' {laid at Home, and never
have fatigu'd my {elf in the World as I had done 3,
and I ufed often to fay to my (elf, I could ha'
done this as Well in England among my Friends, as
ha' gone 5000 Miles ofl to do it among Strangers
and Savages in a W ildernefs, and at fuch a Diftance,
as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the leaft Knowledge of me. .

In this manner qued to look upon my Condition
with the utmolt Regret. 1 had no Body to con--
verfe with, but now and then this Nei hbonr; no
Work to be done, but by the Labour 0 my Hands;
and I ufed to fay, Iliv'd quI like a Man call away.
upon fome defolate Ifland, that had no Body there
but himfelf. But how juit has it been, and how fhould
all Men refleBc, that, when they compare their .pre--
fent Conditions with others that are worfe, Heaven
, may oblige them to make the Exchange, .and be
convinc'd of their former Felicity, by their Experk
ence: I fay, how jufi has it been, that the truly foli<<
tary Life I refleeted on in an Ifland of meer Defol-
tion fhould be my LOt, who had {0 often. unjuflly
compar'd it with the Lifewhich I then led, in which
hadI continued, I had in all Probability been ex-
ceeding profperous and rich.

I was in forne Degree fettled in my Meafures for
Carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain of the Ship, that took me up at Sea,
went back; for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage,
near three Months, when telling him what little
Stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me
this fi'iendlyand finccre Advice,Sez'gfiorInglefefays hc,
for {0 he always called me,if y on will. give meLettcrs,

great Ufe to me. ' . - '

When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortune
made, for Iwas furptized with Joy ofit; and my
good Stewardthe Captain had laid out the five
Pounds which my Friend had [cut him for a Pre-
fent for himfelf, to purchafe, and bring me over a
Servant under Bond for {ix Years Service, and would
not aetept of any Confideration, except a little
Tobacco, which I w0uld have him accept, being
of my own Produce.

' Neither was this all ; but my Goods being all
Engli J ManufaEURtures, fuch as Cloath, Stuffs, Bays,
and Things particularly valuable and defirable in
the Country, I found Means to fell them to a very
great Advantage 5 [0 that I may fay, I had more
than four times the Value of my firfl Cargo, and
Was now infinitly beyond my poor Neighbour, I
'mean in the Advancement of my Plantation; for the
firlt thing Idid, I bought me a Negroe Slave, and an
European Servant alfo 5 I mean another befides that
which the Captain brought me from Lisbon. ,

But as abus'd Ptofperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greateit Adverfity, {0 was it with
me. .. I went on the next Year with reat Succefs in
' my Plantation : I raifed fifty great olls of Tobac-
co on my own Ground, more than I had difpofed
of for Neceflaries among my Neighbours; and
thefe fifty Rolls being each of above a 100 PM. were
well cur'd and laid.by againfl the Return of the
Fleet from Lislzo'n: And now increafingin Bufinefs
and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of Pro-
ie8cs and Undertakings beyond my Reach ; {nch as
are indeed often the Ruin of the bell; Heads in
Bufinefs.

. Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy Things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father [0 carneitly recom-
mended a quiet retired Life,- and of which he had
{0 fenfibly defcribed the middle Station of Life to
be full off 5 but other Things attended me, and I
was {till to be the wilful Agent of all my own
Miferies; and particularly to encreafe my Fault,
and double the Reflections upon my (elf, wlfich in
my future Sorrow's I {hould have Leifure to make;
all thefe Mifcarriages were procured by my appa-
rent obilinate adhering to my foolifh Inclination, of
wandring Abroad, and purfuing that InclinatiOn, in
Contradiction to the clearei't Views of doing my
{elf good, 'in a fair and plain Purfuit of thofe Prof-e
peets, and thofe Meafures of Life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to ptefent me with, and.
, to make my Duty. -
' As I had once done thus in my breaking away
from my Parents, {0 I could not be content now,
but I mull: go and leave the happy View I had of
being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantati-
on, only to purine .a rail) and immoderate Defire of
rifing falter than the Nature of the Thing admit-
ted; and thus I wit my {elf down again into the
deepell Gnlph of human Mifery that ever Man fell
into, or perhaps could be confifient with Life and
a State of Health in the World. 1,

To come then by jufl: Degrees, to the Pattie
culars of this Part of my Story 5 you may fuppofe,
that having now lived almol'c four Years in the
Brafllo, and beginning to thrive and profper very
well upon' my Plantation; Ihad not only learn'd
the Language, but had contraeted Acquaintance
and Friendlhip among my Fellow-Planters, as well
as among the Merchants at St. Salt/adore, Which
was our Port; and that in my Difcourfes among

them,
them, I had frequently given them an Account of
my two Voyages to the Coafl: of Guinea, the
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, and
how-eafy it was to purchale upon the Coafl, for
Trifles, fuch as Beads, _Toys, Knives, Scill'ars,
Hatchets, Bits of Glafs, and the like; not only
Gold Duft, Guinea Grains, Elephants Teeth, (76.
but Negroes for the Service of the Brafi/s, in great
Numbers.

' They lifiened always very attentively to my
Difcouries on thel'e Heads, but efpecially to that
Part which related to the buying Mgroes, which
was a Trade at that Time noc only not far entred
into, but as far as it was, had been carry'd on by
the Affiento's, or Permiflion of the Kings ofSpaz'n
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Publick, fo that
few Mgr'oe: were brOnght, and thofe excemve
dear.

It happen'd, being in Company with fome Mere
chants and Planters of my Acquaintaince, and
talking oi'thofe Things very earnellly, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and told me'
they had been mufing very much upon what 1 had
dilc0t1tfed with them of, the lafl Night, and they
came to make a fecret Propofal to me; and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had
a, mind to fit out a Ship to go to Guinea, that
they. had all Plantations as well as I, and were
flraiten'd for nothing lo much as Servants ; that as
it was a Trade that could not be carry'd on, bev
" caufe they could not publickly fell the Negroes
when they came Home, {0 they delir'd to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on
Shore privately, and divide them among their
own Plantations ; and in a word, the Quellion
was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coall:_

of
of Guimy .3 And they offer'd me that I fhould have
my equal Share of the Negrm, without providing
any Part of the Stock. ' -

This was a fair Propofal, it mull be confefs'd,

had it been made to any one that had not had a
' Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair Way of coming. to be very
confiderable, and with a'good Stodt upon it. But
for me that was thus entered and ellablilhed, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four Years more, and to have fent For the
other hundred Pound from England, and who in
that time, and with that little Addition, could
fcarce ha' Faii'd of being worth three or four thou-
faud Pounds Sterling, and that encreafing too 5 for
me to think off'uch 2. Voyage, was the molt pre--
poll'erous Thing that ever Man in, inch Circum-
l'tances could be guilty of.

But I that was born to be my own Defiroyer,'
could no more refilt the Offer than I could reltrain
my firft rambling Defigns, when my Father's good
Counfcl was lolt upon me. In a word, I told them
I would go with all my Heart, il'they would un-
dertake to look after my Plantation in my Abe
fence, and would difpofe of it to fuch as I lhould
direct, if I milcarry'd. This they all engag'd to
do, and entred into Writings or Covenants to do
{.05 and I made a formal Will, difpoling of my
Plantation and mates, in Cafe of my Death, ma~
king the Captain of the Ship that had fav'd my Life,
as before, my univerfal Heir, but obliging him to
difpofe of my Efi'eets, asI had direeted in my Will,
one half of the Produce being to himfelf, and the
other to be fhipp'd to England.

In fliort, I took all poflible Caution to preferve
my Efiefis and keep up my Plantation 5 had I u-
fed half as much Prudence to have look'd into my

own
own Intercl}, and have made a Judgment of . what
I ought to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from f0 profperous an
Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of a' '
thriving Circumfiance, and gone upon a Voyage

to Sea, attended with all its common Hazards; to

fay nothing of the Reafons I had to expeaz particu-

lar Misfortunes to my (elf. "

But I was hurry'd on, and obey'd blindly the

Die'tates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon ; and
accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Cat-
'go furnilhed,' and all Things done as by Agree-
ment, by my Partners in the Voyage, I went on
Board in an evil Hour again, the firft ofSeptembei,
165 9, being the fame Day eight Year thatI went
from my Father and Morher at Had, in order to
218: the Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to
my own Interefi.'
- Our Ship was about 120 Tun Bu'rthen, carried'
fix Guns, and fourteen Men, including the Mailer,
his Boy, and my felf; we had on Board no large
Cargo of Goods, except of fnch Toys as were fit
for our Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads,
bits of Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, efpecially
little Looking-Glades, Knives, Sciflars, Hatchets,
and the like. ' '

The fame Day I went on Board we fer fail,
{landing away to the Northward upon our own
Coal}, with Defign to firetch over for the African
Coafi, when they came about 10 or I 2 Degrees of
Northern Latitude, which it feems was the man-*
net of their Conrle in thofe Days. Wehad very
good Weather, only excellive hot, all the way up-z.
On our own Coall, till we came the Height of
{Jaye St, Ange/23mm from whence keeping farther oil?
at Sea we loll Sight of Land, and Lleer'd as if we
was bound for thellle Fe. iia/'id dc Norm/m, holding '
' our
our Courfe N. E. by N. and leaving thofe Ifles on
the Eafi ; in this Courfe we pail the Line in about
1 2 Days time, and were by. our lalt Obfervation in
'7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude, whena vi~
'olent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out of
our Knowledge; it began from the South-E31},
came about to the NortheWefi, and then fettled
into the North-Bait, from whence it blew in fuch
a terrible manner, that for 12 Days together we
could do nothing but drive, and fcudding away
- before it, let it carry us Whither ever Fate and the
Fury of the Winds ditee'te'd ; and during thefe' 1'2
Days, 'I need not lay, that I expeaed every Day
to be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any in the Ship
expeEt to fave their Lives.

In this Difirefs, we had, befides the Terror of
the Storm, one of our Men die of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy walh'd over-board ; a-
bout the twelfth Day the Weather abating a little,
the Mailer made an Obfervation as well as' he
could, and found that he was in about eleven De-
grees North Latitude, but that he was twenty two
Degrees of Longitude difference Weft from Cape St.
Augufiino; in that he found he Was gotten upon the

Coai't of Guiana, or' the North Part of Bra/1'1, be- -

yond the River Amozoaer, toward that of the Ri-
ver Oraqaoqae, commonly call'd the Great River, and
began to confult with me what Courfe he fliould
take, for the Ship was leaky and very much difa~

bled, and- he was going directly back to the Coait
of Bra/i]. .

I was politively- againl't that, and looking over
the Charts of the Sea-Coal} of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
us to have recourfe to, till we came Within the Cir~
sic of the CarriMe--I/Zandr, and therefore refolved'
to Rand away for Barbadoer, which by keeping off

2
at Sea, to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph
of Mexico, we might eafily perform, as we hoped,
in about 15 Days Sail; whereas we could not
p'oflibly make our Voyage to the Ceaijt of Africa,
without fome Afliflance, both to our Ship. and
to our (elves. ' ' _

, With this Defign we chang'd ou'r Courfe, and
fieer'd away 'N. W by [V in 'order to reach {om'e
ofour Engli/b Iflands, where I hoped For Relief;
but our Voyage was otherwife determined, for
'being in the Latitude of I2 Deg. 18 Min. 3 fe--
cond Storm came upon us, which carry'd 11,3 away
with the fame Impetuofity Weliward, and drove
us {0 Out of the very Way of all humane Com-
.merce, that had our Lives been fated, as to
the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de-
v'our'd by Savages than ever returning to our 0er
Country. '

, In this Diflrefs, theWind blouringliii} very hard,
one of our Men early in the Morning, cry'd out,
Land; and we had no fooner run out of the Ca-
bin to look out, in hopes of [eeing whereabouts
in the World we were 5 but the Ship flruck upon
aSand, and in a Moment her Motion being fo
flopp'd, the Sea broke over her in inch a manner,
that we expected we ihould all' have perifh'd im-
mediateiy, and we were immediately driven into
clo. e Quarters to {helter us from the very Foam
and Sprye of the Sea.

It is not eafy for any one, who has not been
in thelike Condition, to defcribeor. conceive the
Coniierna'cion of Men in fuch Circumfiances; we
knew norhing where we were, or upon what Land
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland, or the.
Main 5 whether inhabited, or not inhabited; and
as the Rage or the Wind was fljill great, tho' ra-
ther leis than at firfl, we could not {-3 much as

hopel: 49 :l
hepe to have the Ship hold many Minutes without
breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by a kind of
Miracle fliould turn immediately about. In a
Word, we {at leaking one upon a'norher, and exe
peeling Death every Moment, and every Man able
ing accordingly, as preparing for another World ;
for there Was little or nothing more for us to do' in
this: That which was our preient Comfort, and all
the Comfortwe had, was, That centrary to but;
Expec'tation the Ship did not break yet, and that
the Mailer (aid, the Wind began to abate.

Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the Ship having thus {truck upon the
Sand, and flicking too fall for us to eXpeet her get;
ting oil, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed;
and had nOthing to dobut to think of {aving our
Lives as well as we ebuld; we had a Boat at but
Stern, full before the Storm, but flieawas firitlla'V'd
by dalhing againlt the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place {he broke away, and either funk Or
was driven of to Sea; (0' there was no H0pe from
her: We had anOther Boat 'On Board, but how to
get her off into the Sea, was" a doubtful-Thing 5
however, there was no roOm to debate, for we
faney'd the Ship wOuld break in Pieces every Mi"
nut:l ; and fome told us ihe was aetually broken al'e
rea v- . . l . . . ,

In this Dilirel's, the Mate of our Veffel lays hold
of the Boat, and with the Help of the tell ol'the"
Men, they got her flung over the Ship's-tide, ahd
getting all into her, let go', and Committed c'ur . -
ielveS, being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy;
and the wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated
- eonfiderably', yet the Sea went dreadful high upon
the Shore, and might well be call'd, Den wild Zea;
as the. Duteb' call the Sea in a Storm; -

E Arid[so]

- And now our Cafe was very difmalindeed; for
we all {aw plainly, that the Sea went {0 high, that
the Boat could not live, and that we ihould be ine--
vitably drown'd. As to making Sail,we had none,
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
it; [0 we work'd at the Oar towards the Land,
tho' with heavy Hearts, like Mcn going to Executi--
On; for we all knew, that when the Boat came nea-
rer the Shore, {he would be dafh'd in a thoufand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However we
committed our S'ouls' to God in the moi't earneit
manner, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore,
we hallen'd our Dellruelion with our own Hands,
pulling- as well as we could towards Land.

What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,

Whether Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the only
Hope that could rationally give us the leafl: Shadow
of ExPefiation, was, if we might happen into fome
Bay or Gulph, or the Mouth of forne River, where
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in, or
gotunder the Lee of the Land, and perhaps made
fm00th Water. Bnt there_was nothing of this ap-
peared ; but as we made nearer and nearer the Shore,
the Land look'd more frightful than the'Sea.
_ After We had row'd, or rather driven about a
League and a Half, 'as We reckon'd it, a raging
Wave, Mountain-like, I came rowling a--l'tern of us,
and plainly bad us expetdegc the Gourde-Grace. In a
word, it took'us with fuch a Fury, that it overfet
the Beat at once; and feparating us as well from
the Boat, as from one 'anOther, gave us not Time
hardly to fay, O God! for we are all [wallowed
up in a Moment.

Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought
which I feet when Ifunk into the Water; for tho' I
fwam very well, yet Icould not delivermyfelf from
the Waves, fo as to draw Breath, 'till the Wave

havmg
having driven me, or rather carried me a vafi Way
on towards the Shore, and having {pentit fielf, went
back, and left me upon the Land almofi dry', but
half dead with the Water I took in, I had fo much .
Prefence of Mind as well as Breath left, that feeing
myfelf nearer the main Land than I expee'red, I got
upon my Feet, and endeavoured to make on to-
wards the Land as fail as I could, before another
Wave lhould return, and take me up again. But I
foon found it was impoflible to avoid it; forI {aw
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, and?
as furious as an Enemy which I had' no Means or;
Strength to contend with 5 m"y Bufinefs was to hold
my Breath, and rife myfelf upon. the Water, if'I":
could; and {o by {wimming to preferve my Breath~' '
ing, and Pilot myfelf towards the Shore, ' if 'pofli-
ble 5 my greateit Concern now being, that the Sea,
as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore
when'it came on, might not carry me back again
with it when it' gave- back towards the Sea.

The Wave that came upon me again, buried me "
at once 20 or go Foot deep in its own Body ,- and I
could feel my' {elf carried with a mighty Force and
Swiftnefs towards the Shore a .very great Way ; but
I held my Breath, andaflilled my felfto fwiin {till
forwards with all my Might. I was ready to burfi
with holding my Breath, when, asI felt my {elf
rifing up, fo to my immediate Relief, I found my
Head and Hands {hoot out above the Surface of the
Water; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time
that Icould keep my {elf [9, yet it reliev'd me
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was
covered again with .Watera good while, but not
{0 long but I held. it out; and finding the Water
had {pent it felt, and began to return, I flrook for-
ward againfl: the Return of the Waves, and felt
Ground again with my Feet. Iilood {till a few.

E2 M0'
Mements to recover Breath, and 'till the Water
went from me, and then took to my Heels,and run,
.with what Strength I had, farther towards the
Shore: But neither would this deliver me from
"the Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in af-
ter me again, and twice more I was lifted up by

:the Waves, and earry'd forwards as before, the
'Shore being very flat.

The lafi Time of thefe two had well near been
fatal to me; for the Sea having hurry'd me along as
before, landed me, or rather dafh'd rne againft a
'Piece of a Rock ; and that with {ueh Force, as it
left me fenfelefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own .
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and
Breafl, beat the Breath, as it were, quite out ofmy
Body; and had it return'd again immediately, I
mull have been firangled in the Water; but I re-
-cover'd a little before the Return of the Waves;
and feeing I {hould be eover'd again with the Wa~
ter, I refolv'd to hold fail by a Piece of the Rock,
and {o to hold my Breath, ifpoflible,'till the Wave
went back; now as the Waves were not {0 high as
at firfi, beingnear Land, I held my Hold 'till the
.Wave abated, and then fetch'd anorher Run,
which brought me {0 near the Shore, that the
next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did nor [0
-fwallow me up as to carry me away, and the next
"Run Itook, I got to the main Land, where, to
my great Comfort, I elamber'd up the Clifts of
the Shore, and fat me down upon the Grafs, free
from ' Danger, and quite out of the Reach of the
:Water. .

g- I was. now' landed, and fafe on Shore, and began
:to look up and thank Gad that my Life was'lav'din
~a Cale wherein there-was fomeMinutes before fearee
anymore to hope. i believe iLt'isirnpolfible to ex:

the Soul-are, when it is [0 fav'd, as {my fay," Out
of the very Grave; and I do nor wonder now at
that Cufiom, wiz. That when a Malefaetor, who
has the Halter about his Neck, is ty'd up, and wit
going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought
to him: I fay, I do not wonder that they bring. a.
Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprize may no:
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and overt
whelm him :

For fadden joys, like Griefr, 'confbumi at firfl.

I walk'd about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
{and Geltures and Motions which I cannot defcribe,
reflecting upon all my Comrades that were drown'd,
and that there {hould not be one Soul fav'd but my
{elf ; for, as for them, I never {aw them afterwards,
or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats,
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.

IcalI my Eyes to the firanded Vefl'el, when the
Breach and Frorh of the Sea being {0 big, I could
hardly fee it, it lay {0 far off, and confider'd,Lord!
how was it poflible I could get on Shore!

After I had folac'd my Mind with the comfortable
Part of my Condition, I began to look round me to
ice what kind of Place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I foon found my Comforts abate;
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful Deliverance :
For I was wet, had no Cloaths to {hift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I lee any Profpe& before me, but that of pe~
rifhin'g with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild -
Beal'ts ,- and that which was particularly afliieting
to me, was, that Iliad no Weapon either to hunt

E 3 and
and kill any Creature for my Sufienance, or to dee
find my felfagainflt any other Creature that might
defire to kill me for their's : In a Word, I had no'
thing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, and
a little Tobacco in a Box; this was all my Provifi-
on, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of
Mind, that forawhileI run aboutlike a Mad-man 5
Night-coming upon me, I began with a heavy
Heart to confider what would be my Lot if there
were any ravenous Beafis in that Country, feeing
at Night they always come abroad for their Prey.

All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at
that Time, was, to get up into a thick bufhy Tree
like a Fitr', but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I refolv'd to fit all Night, and confider the
next Day what Death I fhould die, for as yet I
faw no Profpeet ofLife 5 I walk'd about a Furlong
from the Shore, to fee if I could find any freih Wa:
ref to drink, which I did, to my great Joy; and ha-
ving drank, and put a little T obaccoin my Month
to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and get-
ting up into it, endeavout'd to place myfelf [0, as
,. that if I {hould flcep, I might not fall; and-having
cut me a ihort Stick, like a Truncheon, for my
Defence, I took up my Lodging, and having been
excelfively fatigu'd, I fell {all alieep, and flept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my Condition, and found myfelf the molt rev
freih'd with it, that I think I ever was on Inch an
Occafion.

When I wak'd, it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Storm abated, {0 that the Sea did
not rage and {well as before: But that which fur-
priz'd me molt, was, that the Ship was lifted OPE
in the Night from the Sand where {he lay, by
the Swelling of the Tide, and was driven up al--
moft as far as the Rock, which IfirIt mention'd,

' where
where I had been {0 bruis'd by the dafhing me a>>
gainlt it; this being within about a Mile from the

hore where I was, and the Ship feeming toi'cand
upright fiill, "I wilh'd my {elf on Board, that, at
lealt, I might {ave fome necelfary Things for my
Ufe.

When I came down from my Appartment in the
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the firi'c Thing
I Found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and
the Sea had tofs'd her up upon the Land, about
two Miles on my Right~Hand. I walk'd as fat as I
could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the
Boat, which was about half a Mile Broad, fol
came back for the prefent, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where I hop'd to find {ome-
thing for my prefent Subfiitence.

A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm,.
and the Tide ebb'd [0 far out, that I could come
within a quarter of a Mile of the Ship 5 and here
I found'a freih renewing of my Grief, for I faw
evidently that if we had kept on Board, we had
been all fafe, 'that is to lay, we had all go: fafe
on Shore, and I had not been {0 miferable as to
be left entirely deftitute of all Comfort and Com-
pany, as now I was; this forced Tears from my
Eyes again, but as there was little Relief in that,
I refolv'd, if poliible, to get to the Ship, fol
pull'd off my Cloaths, for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water; but when I came
to the Ship, my Difficulty was {till greater to
know how to get on Board, for as {he lay a-gronnd,
and high out of the Water, there was nothing
within my Reach to lay hold of, I [warn round
her twice, and the fecond Time I fpy'd a {mall
Piece of a Rope, which I wonder I did not fee
at firfl, hang down by the Fore-Chains {0 low,

E 4, as[are]

as that with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and
by the help of that Rope; gor up into the Fore;-
Cafile of the Ship, here I found that.the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold,
but that the lay fo on the Side of a Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay lifted up
upon the Bank, and her Head low "almolt to
_ the Water 5 by this Means all her Quarter was
free; and all that was in that Part was dry;
for you may be fure my firfl: Work was to fearch
and mice what was fpoii'd, and what was
free; and (it'll, Ifound that all the Ship's Pro-
irificns were dry and untouch'd by the Water,
and being very Well difpos'd to eat, I went to
the Bread-Room and fill'd my Pockets with Bill'-
'Ic'et, and eat it as I went about other Things,
{pt I had no time to lofe ? I alfo found {ome Rum
in the great Cabin, of which I rock a large
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of
to {pirit me for what was before me: Now I
wanted norhing but a Boat to furniih my {elf with
many Things which '1 forefaw would be very ne-
ceil'ary to me.

It was in vain to {it fiill and wiih for what was
not to be had, and this Extremity rouz'd my
Application ; we had feveral {pare Yards, and.
two or three large Sparrs of Wood, and a {pare
._ Top-ma? or two in the Ship ; I refolv'd to fall to
work with thefe, and flung as many of them
over Board, as I could manage for their Weight,
tying every one with a Rope, thatthey might .
.n'o't drive away 5 when this was done I went down
the Ship's Side, and pulling them i0 me, I ty d
four of them fall together ot both Ends as well
as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying
two "or three {hort Pieces of Plank upon them
erofs--Way's, I found I could Walk upon it vcitly

"1:: 6' 3'
well, but that it was not able to bear any great
Weight, the Pieces being too light; {0 I went to
work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a {pare
Top malt into three Lengths, and added them to
my Raft, with a great deal of Labour and Pains,
but hope of furnifhing my {eilwith NecelTaries, en-
courag'd me to go beyond what I {hould have been
able to have done upon anorher Occafion.

My Raft was now flrong enough to bear any
reafonable Weight; my next Care was what to
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon
it from the Surf of the Sea 5 burl was nor long con-
fidering this, I fitfl laid all the Planks or Boards up-
on it that I corild get, and having confider'd well
what I molt wanted, I firlt got three of the Sea-
mens Chells, whicn I had broken open and empty'd,
and lower'd them down upon my Raft ; the firll:
of thefeI fili'u' wtth Provilions, rviz. Bread, Rice,
three Dun-l: Cheefes, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's
F leih, wnic'h we liv'd much upon, and a little Red
mainder ol'European Corn, which had been laid by
for fome Fowls which we brought to Sea with us,
but the Fowls were kill'd ; there had been Tome
Early and Wheat together, but, to my great Di!>>
appointment, I found afterwards that the Rats had
eaten or fpoil'd it all 5 as For Liquors, I found {cu
veral Cafes of Bortles belonging to our Skipper, in
which were {ome Cordial Waters, and in all about
five or fix Gallons of Rack, thefe I fiow'd by
themfelves, there being no need to put theminto
the Chelt, not no room For them. While Iwas
doing this, I Found the Tide begin to flow, tho'
very calm, and I had the Mortification to fee my
Coat, Shirt, "and Walt-coat, which I had left on
Shore upon the Sand,- {wim away ;._ as for my
Breeches, which were only Linnen and open-knee'd,
Ilwam on Board in them and my Stockings: How-

- CV61:
ever this put me upon rummaging for Cloaths, of
which I found enough, but took no more than I
-wanted for prefent Ufe, for I had Other Things
which my EYe was more upon, as firlt Tools to
work with on Shore, and it was after long l'earch-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Chelt, which
was indeed a very ufet'ul Prize to me, and much
' more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would
have been at that time ; 1 got it down to my Raft,
even whole as it was, Without lofing Time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contain'd.
My next Care was for fome Ammunition and
'Arms; there were two very good Fowling-Pieces
in the greet Cabin, and two Pillols, thefe I {e-
cur'd firl't, with fome Powder-Horns, anda [mall
Bag of Shot, and two old rul'ty Swords: I knew
there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew nor where our Gunner had flow'd them,
but with much Search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe
two 'I got to my'Raft, with the Arms, and now
Ithonght my {elf pretty well freighted, and be--
" gun to think how I fhould get to Shore with them,
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and the leaf}:
Cap full of Wind would have overfet all my Na.-
vigation.~ ~
I had three Encouragements. I. A {moorh
calm Sea. 2. The Tide tiling, and letting in to
the Shore. 3. What little Wind there was blew
me towards the Land 5 and thus, having found two
or three broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and
befides the Tools which were in the Cheft, I found
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this
Cargo} put to Sea : Fora Mile, or thereabouts my
Raft went very well, only that I Found it drive a
little difiant from the Place where I had landed be--
fore, by which I perceiv'd that there was form: 11.27
r3..t
draftof the Water, and confequently I hop'd to
find fome Creek or River there, which I might
make ufe of as a Port to get to Land with my

Cargo. .

As Iimagin'd, fo It was, there appear'd before
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a.
{trong Current of the Tide to let into it, lo I gui-
ded my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid*
die of the Stream : But here I had like to have
fuffer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily would have broke my Heart, for know-
ing norhing of the Coal}, my Raft run a--ground
at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not being- a-
ground at the other End, it wanted but a little
that all my Cargo had flipp'd ofF towards that
End that was a--float, and {o fall'n into the Wa-
ter : Idid my utmoit by fetting my Back againfl:
the Chefis, to keep them in their Places, but could
not thrult off the Raft with all my Strength, neia
ther durit Iflir from the Poflure I was in, but hold-
ing up the Chefls with all my Might, fioodin that
Manner near half an Hour, in which time the ri-
fing of the Water brought me a little more upon a
Level, and a little after, the Water Pcill tiling, my
Raft floated again, and I thrult her off with the
Carl had, into the Channel, and then driving up
higher, I at length found my {elf in the Mouth of
alittle River, with Land on both Sides, and a
firong Current or Tide running up, I look'd on
borh Sides for a proper Place to get to Shore, for
Iwas n0t willing to be driven too high up the
River, hoping in time to fee fome Ship at Sea,

\and therefore refolv'd to place my {elf as near the- - \
Coafl: as I could. I

At length I {py'd a little Cove on the right
Shore of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
Difliculty Iguided my Raft, and at lait gdt'fo near, '

as
' as that, teaching Ground with my Car, 1 could
' thrufl her direetly in, but herei had like to have
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again 3' for that Shore
lying pretty fieep, that is to fay Hoping, there
wasno Place to land, but Where one End of my
Float, if it run on Share, would lie {0 high, and
the other fink lower as before, that it would en-
danger my Cargo again: Allthat I could do, was
to wait 'till the Tide was at the highcfl, keeping the
Raft with my Car like an Anchor to hold the Side
of it fair to the Shore, near a flat Peice of
Ground which I expee'ted the Water would flow
over; and {o it did : As {can as! found Water
enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of Water, I
thrufr her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and
there faflenld or mor'cl her by flicking my two
broken Oats into the Ground; one on one Side
near one End, and one on the orher Side, near the
other End 3 and thusl lay .till the Water cbb'd a.-.
way, and left my Raft and all my Cargo {afe on
Shore.

My next Work was to view the Country, and
feek a proper Place for my Habitation,and where
to flow my Goods to fecure them from whatever
might happen ; where I was, I yer knew nor, Wile-.-
ther on the Continent or on an lfland, whether in~
habited, or not inhabited; whether in Danger of
wild Beaiis or not: There was a Hill net above
ahflile from me, which rofeup very Heep and high,
and which feem'd to over-mp fume other Hills
which lay as ina Ridge from it Northward ;1_ took
out one of the Fowling Pieces, and one of the Pi--
itols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I
travell'd for Difeovery up to the Top of that Hill,
where after 1 had with great Labour and Difficul-
ty got to the Top, l { 11W my Fate to my great
Afiiietion, (even) that l was in an lilaud environ'd

.every
every. Way with the Sea, no Land to be feen, ex"
cept fome Rocks which lay' a great Way .of'r, and
two {mall Iflands lei's than this, which lay about
three Leagues to the Weft.

I found alfo that the Illand I was in was barren,
and, as Ifaw good Reafon to believe, un--inhabited,
except by wild Bealls, of whom however I faw
none, yet 1 law abundance of Fowls, but knew
not their Kinds, neither when I kill'd them could
I tell what was fit for Food, and what nor 5 at my
coming back, I {her at a great Bird which I {aw
fitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great Wood, I
believe it was the firlt Gun that had been fir'd
there fince the Creation of the World; I had no
foouer fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls of
many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and
Crying, every one according to his ufual Note 5
but net one of them of any Kind that I knew: As
for the Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of
a Hawk, its Colour and Beak relembling it, but
had no Talons or Claws more than common, its
F lefh wasCarrion, and fit for norhing.

Contented with this Dil'covery, Icame back to
my Raft, and fell to Work to bring my Cargo on
Shore, which took me up the tell of that Day, and
what to do with my felt at Night I knew not,nor
indeed where to tell; for I was afraid to lie down
on the Ground, not knowing but {ome wild Beafk
might devour me, tho', as I afterwards found,
there was really no Need for thofe Fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my
{elf round with the Chefls and Boards that I had
brought on Shore, and made a" kind of a Hut for
that Night's Lodging; as for Food, Iyet {aw not:
which Way to fupply my felt, except that I? had

a - '{eenI 63- ]
.{eentwo or 'three Creatures like Hares run out of
the Wood where I {hot the Fowl.

I now began to confider, that I might yet get a
great many Things out of the Ship, which would
be ufeful to me, and particularly fome of the Rig-
ging, and Sails, and {uch Other Things as might
come to Land, and I refolv'd to make anotherVoy-

_age on Board the Veliel, if poihble ; and as I
knew that the firfi Storm that blew muf'tnecefi'arily
breakher all in Pieces, I rel'olV'd' to let all other
Things apart, 'till'I gor every Thing out of the
Ship that I could get 5 then I call'd a Council, that
is to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I fliould take
baek'the Raft, but this appear'd impracticable ,- lo
I refolv'd to go as before, when :the Tide was
down, and I did {0, only that I firipp'd before I.
went from my Hutt, having norhing but a che-
quer'd Shirt, aPair of Linnen Drawers, and a~Pair
of Pumps on my Feet. .

I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience ofit--he'
firft, I neither made this {0 unweildy, nor loaded
it [0 hard, but yet I bretight away feverai Things
very ufeful to me 5 as firfi, in the Carpenter's Stores
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes,
a great Shrew-Jack, a Dozen or two ofHatchets,
and above all, that molt ufeful Thing call'd a
Grind-Prone; allthefe I i'eeur'd together, with fe-
veral Things belonging to the Gunner, particular--
ly two or three Iron. Crows, and two Barrels of
Musket-Bullets, {even Muskets, and anorher'Fow-
ling--Piece, with fome {mall Quantity of Powder
more; alarge Bag full of {mall Shot, and a great
Roll ofSheet-Lead: But this was {0 heavy,I could
not hoile it up to get it over the Ship's Side.

. Befides thefe things, Itook all the Mens Cloaths
that I could find, anda {pare Fore--top~fail, a Ham-
mock,mock and fome Bedding,- and with this I loaded
my {econd Raft, and brought them all fafe on Shore
to my very great Comfort.

I was under {ome Apprehenfions during my Ab-
{ence from the Land, that at lealt my Provifions
might be devout'd on Shore ; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Vifitor, only there {at a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chefis,
which when I came towards it, ran away a little
Diitance, and then flood ftill; fhe fat very com~
pos'd, and unconcern'd, and look 'd full in my F ace,
as if {he had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I
prefented my Gun at her, but as [he did not under-
fiand it, {he was perfectly nnconcern'd at it, nor
did {he oflfer to {lit away 5 upon which I tofs'd her
a bit of Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not very
free of it, for my Store was not great : However,
I fpar'd hera bit, Ifay, and {he went to it, fmell'd
of it, and eat it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more,
but I thank'd her, and could {pare no more 5 [0 {he
march'd OPE.

Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, tho'I
was fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and bring
them by Parcels, [0 they were too heavy, being
large Casks, I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and {ome Poles which I cut for;
that purpofe, and into this TentI brought every

~ Thing thatI knew would fpoil, either with Rain
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chefis and Casks
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from a:-
ny fudden Attempt, either from Man or Beafi.

When I had done this I block'd up the Door of
the Tent With fome Boards within, and an empty
Chefl fet up an End without, and fprea'ding one
of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-p

mflols juft, at-my Head and my Gun at Length by
me, I went to Bed for the firfi Tiine,"'and flept
it" very

:1..Q [64]

Very quietly all Night, forI was very weary; and
heavy, for the Night before I had fleptlitle, and
had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to fetch all
thofe Things from the Ship, as to get them on
Shore.

Ihad the biggeft Magazine of all Kinds now
that ever were laid up, I believe, For one Man;
butI was not {atisfy'd fiill ; for While the Ship {at
upright in that Poiture, I thought I ought to get
every Thing out of her that I could 5 {0 every Day
at low Water I went on Board, and brought away
fome Thing or orher : But particularly the third
Time I went, I brought away as much 0f the Rig-
ging as I could, as alfo all the {mall Repes and
Rope-twinel could get, with a Piece of {pare Can-
vafs, which was to mend the Sails upon Occafion,
the Barrel of wet Gun-Powder : In a Wordal brought
away all the Sails firit and 111111, only that I was

A fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as mach at a
Time as! could'; for they were no more ufeful to
be Sails, but as meet Canvafs only. , .

But that which comforted me more {til}, was,
that at lait of all, after I had made five or fix fuch
Voyages as thefe, and thOught I had nothing more
to expeet from the Ship that was worth my med-
ling with, Ifay, after all this, I lbund a great HOgn
{head of Bread, and three large Runlets of Rum or
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine-
Flower; this was {urprizing to me, becaufe I had
given over expecting any more Provilions, except
what was fpoil'd by the Water: Ifoon empty'd the
Hogfliead of that Bread, and wrapt it up, Parcel
by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I cut out 5
and in a Word, Igor all this fair: on Shore alfo.

The next DayI made another Voyage; and

now having plunder'd the Ship-of What was portaf .
" ble'
ble and fit to hand out, Ibegan with the Cables;
and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, {uch as
I could move, I got two Cables and a Hawfer on
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get; and
having'cut down the Spritlail-yard, and the MilL
fen--yard,and every .1" hing I could to make a large
Raft, I loaded with it all thofe heavy Goods, and
came away: but my good Luck began now to
leave me a for this Raft was ('0 unweildy, and {o
overloaden, that after I was enter'd the little Cove,
wherel had landed the tell of my Goods, not be--
ing able to guide it {o handily as I did the other,
it overfet, and threw me and all my Cargo into
the Water; as for my {elf it was no great Harm,
for I was near the Shore ; but as to my Cargo,
it was great Part of it loll, efpecially the Iron,
which I expedited would have been of great HR:
to me: However, when the Tide was out. I got
mol-'t of the Pieces of Cable alhore, and fame of
theIron. tho' with infinite Labour; forI was fain
to dip for it into the Water, a Work which fa-
tigu'd me very much: After this I went every Day,
on board, and brought away what [could get.

I had been now thirteen Days on Shore, and had
been eleven Times on Board the Ship; in Which
.TimeI had brought away all that one Pair of
Hands could well be fuppos'd capable to brin , tho'
I believe verily, had the calm Weather em I
{hould have brought away the whole Ship Piece by
Piece: But preparing the 12th Time to go on
Board, I found the Wind begin to rile ; however
at low Water I went on Board, and tho'I thought
Ibad rumag'd the Cabin fo effeelually,as that no~'
thing more could be found, yet I difcover'd a Lock-l
er with Drawersin it, in oneof which Ifound two
or three R_azors',"and one Pair of large Scifl'ars,
With fame ten or a dozen of good Knives and

F Forks 3
Forks; in another I found about Thirty fix POunds
Value in Money, fome European Coin, fomc Brafilg-
{ome Pieces of Eight, fome Gold, fome Silver.
lfmil'd to my felt at the Sight. of this Money, _

ODrug! laid I aloud, what art thou good for ?'
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the Ground, one of [hole Knives is worth all
this Heap, I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en
remain whercthou art, and go to the Eouom as
a'Creature whofe Life is not Worthlaving How'-
ever Upon fecond Thoughts, hook it away, and
Wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, lbcgan
to think of making another Raft, but while Iwas
preparing this, 1 found the Sky over call, and the
W ind began to rife, and in a Quarter of an Hour
it blew a frelh Gale from the Shore; it prefently
occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft, wit 1 the Wind off Shore, and that
it was my Bulinefs to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, Otherwife I might not be able to
reach" the Shore at all: Accordingly I let my
{elf down into the Water, and {warn crofs the
Channel, which lay between the Ship and the
Sands,and even that With Difficulty enough, part-
ly With the Weight of the Thirgsl had about me,
and partly the roughnefs of the Water, for the
Wind role very halllly, and before it was quite

high Water, it blew a Storm.

" But Iwas got Home to my little Tent, where
i lay with all my \Nealth about me very fecure.
It blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morn-
ing w henl look'd out, behold no more Ship was to
be feen; l was a little litrpriz'd, but recover'd my
feli'with this latisfaetory Refit-aim, ryiz. That I
had lofi no Time; nor abated no Diligence to get
every Thing out oihet that could he ufcful to me,
and that indeed there was little left in her that I
was{67]

was able to bring away, if I had had more
Time. ' '

lnow gave over any more Thoughts of the
Ship, orof any Thing outof her, except what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but thole
Things were Oilmall ufe to me. '

My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd av
bout lecuring my {elf either againfl Savageslifa-
ny lhould appear,_or wild Beafls, ifany Were-in the
Illand -,and I had many Thoughts ofthe Method
how to dorhis,an-.i what kind owaelling to make,
Whether Ilhould make me a Cave in the Earth,' or
:1 Tent upon the Earth : And, in fhorr, Irefolv'd
upon both, the Manner and Delcription of which
it may not be improper to give an Account of.

I foon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low
moorilh Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd
Would not be Wholefoane, and more particularly
becaufe there was no Frelh Water near it, {o I re-
folv'd to find a more healthy and more convenient
Spot orTGround. - ,

'I confiilted leveral Things in my Situation.
which It'ound would be proper forme, I it. Health,
and freih Waterl full now mention'd. acily> Shel--
ter from the Heat of the Sun. gdly, Security from
ravenous Creatures, whether Men or Bealiss. 4thly,
a View to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship in
Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my
Deliverance, ofwhichI was not Willing to banilh
all my Expectation yet. .

In learch of a Place proner for this, Ifound a.
little Plain on the fidc ofa tiling Hill, Whole
Front towards this little Plain was fieep as a
Horri'e-lide, (0 that nothing could come down
upon me from the Top; on the fideofthis Rock"

.1: 2 themthere 'was 'a hollow Place worn a little'Way in
like the Entrance or Deor of aCave, but there was
. not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.
On the flat of the Green, juft before this hollow
Place, I. refolv'd to pitch my T'ent :, This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
._ twice as long, and lay like a Green before my
Door, and atthe End of it defcended irregularly
every Way down into the low Grounds by the
Sea-fide. It was on the NNW. Side of the Hill,
{0 that lwas (heltet'd from the Heat every Day,
till it came to a W and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in tbofe Countries is near the Setting.
~ Before lfet up my Tent, Idrew a half-Circle
before the hollow Place, which took in about ten-
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and
twenty yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning
and Ending. ,

In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of firong
Stakes, drivingthem into the Ground till they
flood very firm like Piles, the biggef'c End being
out of the Ground about five Foot and and an half,
and fliarpen'd on the Top ; the two Rows did not
Rand above fix Inches from one another.

Then I took the Pieces of Cable whieh I had cut
in the Ship, and laid them in Rows one upon ',
another, within the Circle between thefe two
Rows of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other
Stakes in the Inlide, leaning againftthem, about
two Poor and a half high, like a Spur to a Poil',

. and this Fence was fo firong, that neither Man or
- Beafl could get into it or over it: This coil me
a great deal ofTi-me and Labour, efpeaally to cut
the Piles in the Woods, bringthem to the Place,

' - and drive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Placel made to be not

.bya Door, but by a fliort Ladder, to go 0th
4 . 't ethe Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I lifted
overafter me, and {o I was c0mpleatly tenced in,
and fortify'd, as I thought, from all the World,
and confequently flept (come in the Night, which
otherwil'e I could not have done, tho' asir appear'd
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.

Into this Fence or Fortrefs, with infinite La-
.bour, 'I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provifions,
Ammunition and Stores, of which you have the
Account above, and I made me a largeTent,which
to preferve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double, viz.
one {mallet Tent within, and one largerTent above
it, and cover'd theuppermoft with a large Tare
paulin which I had fav'd among the Sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
whichI had brought on Shore, but in a Ham-
mock, which was indeed a very good one, and be----
long'd to the'Mate of the Ship.'

Into this Tent I brought all my Provifions, and
every Thing that would {poil by the Wet, and ha-
ving thus enclos'd all my Goods, Imade up the
Entrance, which tillnow Ihad left open, and fo
pafs'd and repafs'd, as I faid, by a fluort Ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my Way
into the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and.
Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent, I laid
'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a Ter~
ras, that {o it rais'd the Ground within about :1
Foot a half; and thus I made me a Cave jufi be~
hind my Tent, which (erv'd me like a Cellar to
my Houfe. '

I: colt me much Labour't and many Days, be,
fore all thefeThings were brought to Perfeeci on, and
therefore I mult'go back to fome other things which
took up fome otmy Thoughts. At the fame time it

F 3 happlled,['70 J
happen'd after I hadlaidmy Scheme'forgth'e fet~
ting up my Tent, ,andmaking'the-Gave, that a
Storm of ,Rain falli:ng,fr0m- a thick: dark Cloud, a
{udden} Flafh ofLightning happe.n'-d-,:-and'aftet
that a great Clap of Thunder, :aseis..naturally the
Eflieetof it; Iwas- not;..fo much 'ftitpri-zid with
. _ the Lightning, as. :I was, with a .Thought'which
darted into my Mind aslwift .asth'eiLightning it

me, when I. thought,. that at "one: 'Blafi all my

fence only, but the-<<providing me 'Food, as I
thought, entirelyvdepended; I was n0thiug near
fo anxious about my. own- Danger, tho'~ had the
Powdettook fire,.~1 .had nevetlnwwn who had
hurt me; .- ~ '. ff --' .' - .
_' Such Imprefiion..did this maltehponme, that
after the Storm was-over, I" laid afide all (.my'
WOrks, my Bui,ldi_ngs,.... and For-tifying, and ap~
ply'd my {elf to make Bags and B0xes to {epatate
the Powder, and keep ita little _ and a little in a.
Parc'el,. in hoPe, that whatever .l might. Come, it
might :not all take Fire at once, and to keep it {o
apart, that it fh'ould not betpoflible to makeone
Part-fire another. [I finifh'd this Work in about'a
Fortnight, and-.I think my'Powder, which in all
was about 24.0 lb. weight, was divided, in not lefs
than a hundred Parcels 5 as to the Barrel that had-
been wet, I did not apprehend any Danger from
that, [0 i plac'd it in my new Cave, Which in my
Fancy I call'd my Kitchin, and the telt I hid up
and down in Holes among the Rocks, {0 that no
wet might come to it, marking very carefully
where I laid .it. .

In-the Interval of time while this was doing, I

thing fit for Food, and as near .as I could to ac-
quaint my felt with what the Ifland produc'd. The
flrfi time I went out I prefently difcover'd that
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great
Satisfaetion to me ; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, we. That they were {0
fliy, {o fubtile, and {o fwift of Foot, that it was
the diflicultelt thing in the World to come at them :
ButI was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting
buti might now and then fliOOt one, as it foon hap-
pen'd, for after I had found their Haunts a little,
I laid wait in this Manner for them : I obferv'd if
they {aw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a-terrible
Fright; but it" they were feeding in the Valleys,
andI was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me, from whence I concluded, that by the
'Pofition of their Opticks, their Sight was (0 di-
"re8ted downward, that they did not readily fee,
Objects that were above them; [0 afterwards I
took this Method, I always climbed the Rocks firflr
to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
Mark. The fir-R {hOt Imade among thefe Crea-
tures, Ikill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid
by her which flue gave fuck to, which griev'd me
heartily s but when the Old one fell, the Kid
flood flock {till by her till I came and took her up,
and not only {0, but when I carried the Old one
with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid follow'd
me quite to my Enclofure, upon whichllaid down
the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and
carried it over my Pale, in hopes to have bred it
up tame, but it would not eat, {0 was I forc'd to
kill it andeat it my felf; thefe two {upply'd me
'with Flefh a great while, for I eat fparingly ; and
{av'd my Provifions (my Bread efpecially) as much
as polfiblc I could. '

' F 4 Having
Having now fix'd my Habitation, I found it ab-
folutely necefl'ary _to provide a Place to make a
Fire in, and Fewel to burn; and what I did for
that, as alfo how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what
,Conveniencies I made, I {hall give a full Account
of in its Place: But I mull firfi give fome little
Account of my fell, and of my Thoughts about
Lifxeling, which it may well be {uppofed were n0t
a w,

I had a difmal Prof-peer of my Condition, for as
I was not call away upon that Illand without her
ing driven, as isfaid, by a violent Storm quite out
at the Courf: OfOuI' intended Voyage, and a great
..Way, 71.2,; forne hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Co::rfe of the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Reafon to confider it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this d-ifolate Place, and in this
difolate Manner I {hould end my Life 5 the Tears
would run p'entifully down my Face when] made
thefe Reflettions, and lometimes I would expofiu--
late with my fell, Why Providence {hould thus
'compleatly ruin its Creatures, and render them
{0 abfolutely miferable, {0 without Help aban-
don'd, {o entirely dcprefs'd, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for fuch a Life.

But fomething always return'd {Wift upon me to
check thefe Thoughts, and to reprove me ,~ and
particularly one Day Walking with my Gun in my
Hand by the Sea-fide, I was very penfive upon the
Subjee't'of my prefent Condition, when Reafon as
it were expoftulated with me t'othcr Way, thus:
Well, you arein a defolare Condition 'tis true, but
pray remember, Where are the tell of you? Did
not you come Elevenof you into the Boat, where
are the Ten? Why were not they {av'd and you
loll? Why were you fingled out ? Is it better to be
here or there? And-then I pointed to the Sea. All

Evils

I
Evils are to be confider'd with the Good that is in
them, and with what worfe attends them.

Then it occur'd to me again, how well Iwas
furnifh'd for my Subfiftence, and what would have
.been my Cafe if it had nor happen'd, Whit/2 was
an Hundred Thouflmd to One, that the Ship floated
from' the Place where {he firft [truck and was dri-
ven fo near to the Shore, that I had Time to get
all thefe Things out of her: What would have
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'd in the
Condition in which I at firlt came on Shore, with-
out Necefl'aries of Life, or Necellaries to fupply
and procure them? Particularly, {aid I aloud, (tho'
to my felt) what Ihould' I'have done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools
to make any - thing, or to work with, without
Cloaths, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of
Covering, and that now I had all thefe to afuffi-
cient Quantity, and was in a fair way toprovidc-
my {elf in inch a manner, as to live without
my Gun when my Ammunition was fpent; . fo
that I had a tolerable View of {ubfilling without
any Want as long as I liv'd; for I confider'd from
the beginning how I would provide for the Acci-
dents that might happen, and for the T imethat
was to come, even not only after my Ammunition
ihould be fpent, but even after my Health or
Strength fhould decay.

I confefs I had not entertain'd any Notion of my
Ammunition being deltroy'd at one Blafi, I mean,
my Powder be'ng blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts of it {o furprizing to me when
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I obferv'd full nowg

And 'now being to enter into a melancholy
Relation of a Scene of {ilent Life, fuch perhaps as
was never heard of in the World before, I {hall-
take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its

Order.
Order, ' It was, by my Account, the 30th of Sept,
when, in the Manner as abovefaid, . I firit {ct Foot
upon this horrid lfland, when the. Sun being, to
us, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almoftjufl; over
my Head, for Ireckon'd my felt, by leervation,
to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees 22 Minutes,

North Of the Line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve

Days, it came into; my Thoughts, that I fllould
Ioie my Reckoning .of Time .for'Want of Books
and Pen and Ink, and {hould even forget the Sab-
bath Days fromxhe working Days ; but to prevent
this, I-cut it with my Knife upona large Poft, in
Eapital Letters, and making it into a great Crofs,
I fer it up on the Shore where I firit landed, via. 1
tame on Share here on ".76" 30th afSept. 165 9. Upon
the Sides of this {quare Pol}, I out every Day a _
Notch with my Knife, and every {eventh Netch
was as long again as, the wit, and every firfl: Day of
the Month as long again as that long one, and thus
I kept my Kalender, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of Time.

In the next Place we are to obferve, that among
the many Things which I brought out of the Ship '-
in the feveral Voyages, which as abovemention'd,
I made to it, I. got feveral Things of lefs Value,
but not at all leis ufelul to me, which I Omitted
fretting down before; as in particular, gens, Ink,
and Paper, (everal Parcels in the Captain 3, Marc's,
Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or tour
Compafies, fomc Mathematical Ini'cruments,_ Di~
als, Perfpeefiiv'es, Charts, and Books ofNavrgat1~
on, all which I huddled together, whetherI might
want them or no; aifo i found three very'good
Bibies, which came to me in my Cargo from Eng-
!xzmi, and which I had pack'd up among my Things;
tome Portagueze Books alfo, and among them two

- or
br three Popifli Prayer-Books, and feveral tithe)?
Books 5 all which I Carefully fecur'd. And I muff
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and
two Cats; of whole eminent Hifiory, Imay have
Occafion to fay {omething in it-'s.,'P-lace ; forI car-
ry'd both- the Cats with me ; an'd as'for the Dog,
he jump'd out of the Ship of himfelf, and {warn
on Snore to me the Day. after Iwent on Shore
with my firll Cargo, and was a truity Servant to
me many Years: I wanted nothing he could fetch
me, nor any Company that he could make up to
me 5 Ionly wanted to have him talk to me, but
that would not do. As I obferv'd before, I found
Pen, Ink, and Paper, and I husbanded them to the
utmolt ; and I {hall fliew, that while'my Ink la-
iled", I kept Things very exaet ; but after that was
gone, I could not; for I could not make any Ink,
by any Means that I' could devife. - --

And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithfianding all that I had amafs'd to-
gether; and ofthefe, this of lnk was one, as alfo
Spade, Pick--Ax, and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth, Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for .
Linnen, I [0011 leatn'd to want'that without niuch
Difficulty. - _ ' .,

This Want of Tools inade ev.ery.Work I did, go
on heavily; and itwasneara whole Year before I
had entirely finilh'd my little Pale or furrounded
Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as
heavy as Icould well lift, were along Time inlcutY=
ting and preparing in the Woods, and moreyby far
in bringing home; fo that I {pent fometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of thoi'e
Polls, and a third Day in drivingit into the Ground;
for which Purpofe I got a heavy Piece of Wood
at firi't,'but at lait bethought myfelf of one of the
Iron Crows, which however, tho' I found it, yet
<< v t Itit made driving thofe Pol'ts or Piles very laborious
and tedious Work.

.But what need I ha' been concern'd at the T e-
dioufnefs of any Thing I had to do, feeing I had
Time enough to do it in ; nor had I any Other Em~
ployment, if that had been over, at leaii, that I
.could forefee, except the ranging the Ifland to feek
for Food, which Idid more or leis every Day.

I now began to confider ferioufly my Conditi~
on, and the Circumfiance I was reduc'd to, and I
drew up the State of my Affairs in Writing, nor fo
much to leave them to any that were to come af-
ter me; forIwas like to have but few Heirs, as
to deliver my ThOughts from daily poring upon
them, and ain&ing my Mind ; and as my Reafon
began now to mailer my Defpondency, I began
to comfort myfelf as well as lcould, and tofet
the Good againfl the Evil, that I might have
fomething to diflinguifli my Cafe from worfe ; and
I Rated it very impartially, like Debtor and Cre~
ditor, the COmfortsI enjoy'd, againfi the Mile-
ries I firfi'er'd, thus:

gotten out j?) many necefl'a--
ry Thing: at will either
[apply my Wants, or ena-
hle me to f apply my 1er 8'
WM at long at I live.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted T efii-
mony, that there was {carce any Condition in the
World {0 miferable, but there was {omething nega-
ti-ve, or fomething pofz'ti've, to be thankful for in it ;
and let this hand as a Direetion from the Experi-
ence of the mofi miferable of all Conditions in this
World, that we may always find in it fomething
to comfort our {elves from, and t0 fet in the De-
fcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of
the Account.

Having now brought my Mind 3 little to refill:
my Condition, and given over looking out to Sea,
to ice ifI could {py a. Ship; Ifay, giving over
thefe Things, I began to apply myfelf to accomv
modate my way of Living, and to make Things
as cafy to me as I could.

I have'[78l

5'1 have already deforibed my Habitation; which
was 3 Tent under the Side of a Rock, furrounded
with a thong Pales of Pofis and Cables. but I might
now rather call it a Wall, for l rais'd a kind of
Wall up againfi it of Torts, about two Foot thick
on the Outlidc,' and after fome time, I think it
'was a Year and half, I rais'tl Ptaftersfrom-it lean-
ing to the. Rock, and thatch'd or cover'd it with
Boughs of Trees, and fuch things as I could get to
keep out of the Rain, which I found at-{ome times
of the Year very violent.

I have already obferved how I brought all my
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I
had made behind me: But I mull obferve too
that at firlt this was a confus'd Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in no Order, {0 they took up
'all my Places I had no room to turn myfclf', So
I f'ct. myi'elf to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth; ior it was a loofe .fandy Rock,
which yielded calily to the Labour 1 bellowed on
it: And f0 when I found I was pretty lafe as to
Bealis of Prey, I work'd fideways to the Right
Hand into the Rocks and then turning to the Right
again, work'd quite out, and made me a Door to
come out, on the Outfide of- my Pale or Fortifi-
cation. ,

This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as
it were a Back-way to my Tent and to my Store-
houfe, but gave me room to [low my Goods.

And now I began to apply my Ililf to make fuch
neceflary things as I found I molt wanted, as par-
ticularly a Chair and a Tables for without theft 1
was not able to enjoy the few Comforts Iliad in the
World; I could not write or cat, or do feveral
things with fo much Picafure without a Table

So I went to work; and here I t'nult needs oh:
' ferve, that as Reafon is the Subllancx: and Origfs
ml, . [79]
rial of theMathematicks, {o 'by Rating and {qua-3
'ring every Thing by Reafon, and by making the.
. mien rational Judgment of Things, every Man
may be in time Mailer of every meehanick Art. I
had never handled Tool in my Life, and 'yet in
time by Labour, Application and Contrivance, I
found at lafi- thatl wanted nothing butI could
have made it, efpeciallyif I had had Tools; how-
ever, I made abundance of Things, even without
Tools, and forne with no moreTools than an Adze
anda Hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite Labour :
For Example, if I wanted a Board,I' had no other
Way but to cut down a Tree, fet it on an Edge be-
fore me, and hew it flat on either Side with my'
Ax, till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank,
and then dubb it fmcoth with myAdze. Itis true,
by this Methodl could make but one Board on:
of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for
but Patience, any more than I had for the prodia "
dious deal of Time and Labour which it took me
up to make a Plank or Board: But my Time of
Labour was little worth, and fo it was as well em-
ploy'd one way as anorher. . , '
However, I made me a Table anda Chair, as
I obferv'd above, in the firi't Place, and this Idid
out of the {hort Pieces of Boards that I brought:
on my Raft from the Ship : But when I _ had
wrought outfome Boards, as above, I made large
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and a Half one
over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a
Word, to feparate every Thing at large in their
Places, that 1 might come eafily at them,- I knock'd
Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns
and all Things that would hang up. '

So
"So that had my Cave been to be (an, 'it look'd
like a general Magazine of all necefl'ary Things,
and I had every Thing {0 ready at my Hand, that
it was a great" Pleafure to me to fee all my Goods
in fuch Order, and efpecially to find my Stack of
all Neceflaries fo great. ' ' ,.
- And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, fOr indeed at firfl:
I was in too much Hurry, and not onlyHun-y
asto Labour, but in too much Difcompofure of
Mind, and my Journal would ha' been full of many
dull things. For Example, I mull have laid thus:
Sept. the 30th, After I gor to Shore and had efcap'd-
drowning, inflead of beinhg thankful to God for
my Deliverance, having rft vomited with the
great Qianrity of {alt Water which was gotten
into my Stomach, and'recovering my {elf a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beat-
ing my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mifery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone, till tir'd
and faint I was forc'd to lye down on the Ground
to repbfe, but durll not {leep for fear of being
devour'd. <<
' Some Days after this, and after I'had been on
board the Ship, and go: all that I could Out of
her, yet I could nor forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a valt Di-
fiance I fpy'd a Sail, ' pleaf'e myfelf with the Hopes
of it, and then after looking Readily till I was al-
mofi: blind, lofe it quite, and {it down and weep
like a Child, and thus encreaf'e my Mifery by my
Foll .

133: having gotten over thefe things in fome Mea-
fure, and havingfettled my Houihould-Sruff and
Habitation, made mea Table and a Chair, and all
as handfome about me as I could,- I began to keep

my- [' 8i ' 1" .
my journal of whichl {ball here gch you the
Copy (tho' in it will be told all thele Particulars

over again) as long as it lafied,' for having no more
Ink 1 was forc'd to leave it ofl.

YMJOURNAL

Eptemlz'er go, 1659. Ipoor miferable Robinflm
Crufae, being Shipwreck'd, during a dreadfnl
Storm, in the Otfing, came on Shore, on this dlf'.'
mal unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd the I/lzmd
ofDefpair, all the tell: of the Ship's Company bei '
ing drown'd, and my {elf almoft dead. . .
All the ten: of the Day I f pent .in afflie'ting my
felf at the 'difmal Circnml'tancesl was brought :0,
mi. I had neither Food, Houfe, Cloaths5 Weapon,
Or Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Relief,-
fawnothing but Death before me,- either that I
Ihould be de'vout'd by wild Beafls, murther'd by
Savages, or (iatv'd to Death for want of Food; At
the Approach of Night, Iflept. in a Tree for fear
of wild Creatures,- but flept foundly tho' it rain'd
all'Night. ' ' -~ ,. '

Oeiolzer I. In the Morning Ifaw to my teat.
Snrprife the bhip had floated with the high ide,
and was driven on Shore again much nearer the
Miami, which as it Was fomc Comfort on one hand;-
for feeing her fit upright, and not broken to pieces
I hop'd,1fthe Wind abated 5 Imight get on board,' .
and get fome Food and Necefi'aties out of her for"
my Relief -, in on the other hand it renew'd, my '
Grief at the Lofs of my Comrades, whoIima-J

Men been,,_fay'd, we might erhaps'haVe'built us

' ' ' 1'16tied us to fame other Part of the World. I fp'ent'
great part of this Day in perplexing my felt' on'
thefe things 3' but at length-feeing the Ship almofi
dry, lwent upon the Sand as near as I Could, and
then Swain on Board}, this Day alfo continu'd rain-
' ing, tho' with no Wind at all.

From the ill of Oftober to the 24th. All thefe
Days entirely {pent in many .l'eireral Voyages to
get all I could out of the Ship, which Ibrought
on Shore, every Tide ofFlood, upon Rafts. MuCh
Rain alfo in thele Days,- thro' With forne Intervals:
affair Weather: But, it feems, this was the rainy
Seafon. _ _'

Off. 20. I oxierfet my Raft, and all the @oods'
I had got Upon it, but being in fhoal Water, and
the things being chiefly" heavy, I recOVer'd many of
them when the Tide was o'ut. _

Off. 23'. It rain'd all Night and all Day, With
fome Gufis of Wind, during which time the Ship
broke in pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder
than. before, and was no more to' be feen, except
the Wreck of her', and thatwonly at low' Water,
I {pent this Day in covering and featuring the Goods
\yhichl had iav'd, that Rain might not fpoil
them..

_ 06}. 26. l walk'd ab0ut the Shore almofi all
Day to find out a Place to fix my Habitation,
greatlyiconcern'd to fecnre my felf from any Attack
in the Night, either from _wild Beafis or Men.
Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper place Under
a Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my En:-
c'ampment, which I relolv'd to firengthen 'with a
\Vork, Wall, or Fortification made ofclonble Piles,
lin'cl within with Cable, and without with Turf.

' From the 26th to the goth I work'd very hard
in carrying; all my Goods to my new Habitation

t 10l'.' 8; J
tho9 fcme' part of the time it rain'd exceeding
hard. .

The gxfi in the Morning I went out into the

Bland with my Gun to" fee for fome Food, and diff-
cover the Country; when I kill'd a She-Goat, and
her Kid folloW'd me home, which I'afterwards
killfd alfo, becaule it would not feed.
, November I. I {Eat Up my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the firf'c Night,'making it as large as
I could with Stakes driving in to living my Ham-
mock upon. . . , . '

AM. '2. I fetup all my Chefis and Boards, and
the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them fb'rn'i'da Fence round me, a little with--
in the Place, I had mark'd out for my Fortifie
cation. . . 1

Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun, and kill'd two
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table. ' . '. .

Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my" times
of work, of going out with my Gun, time of
Sleep, and time oFDiverIiOn, viz. Every Morning
I walk'd Out with my Gun for two or three Hours
if it did not Rain, then emplo'y'd myfelf to work
till about Eleven a-c'lock, then eat what I had to
We on, and from Tw'elv'e to Two I lay down to
Heep, the Weather being" excelfiv'e hot, and then
in the Evening to work again: The working Part
of this' Day and the next were wholly employed
in making my Table, for I was yet but a very forry'
Workman, tho'Time and NeCeffity made me a
compleat natural Mechanic]: foon after, as I believe
it would do any one Elfe. . .

Nov. 5. This Day went abroad with my Gun
and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat, her 3km
yretty foft, but hef'Elelh good fOr nothing: Extery ~
. ' G 2 Creature
Creature I kili'd, I took off the Skins and preferv'd

them. Coming back by the Sea--fliore, Ifaw' ma:-

ny Sorts of Sea-Fowls, which I did nOt undere

{lands but was furpriz'd, and almolt f'righted with

two or three Seals, which, while I was gaZing at,

not-well knowing what they were, got into the
_ Sea, and efcag'd me for that Time.

Now. 6. Alter my Morning Walk, I went to
work with my Table again, and finiih'd it, tho'
not to my Liking; nor was it long before I learn'd
to mendit. '

Nova. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair Wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, roth, and Part of the
12th, (for the "III was Sunday, according to my
ReckOning) I took wholly up to make me a Chair,-
andwith much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape,
but .never to pleafe me; and even in the making I
pull'd it to Pieces {ever-a1 Times. the, Ifoon nc<<
glee'ted my keeping Sunday; for omitting my Mark;-
for them on myPofi, I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This Day it rain'd, which refrelh'd me
exceedingly, and cool'd the Earth, but it ' was ac--
company'd with terrible Thunder and Lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my Powe
det: As icon at it was over, I refolv'd to feparate
my Stock of Powder into as man y, little Parcels as-
-polfible, that it might nor be in Danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. Thefe three Days I {pent in
making little fquare Chefis or Boxes, which might
' hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at molt, of
Powder; and {0 putting the Powder in, I flowed-
it in Places as Iecure and remOte from one anOther,
as poliible. On one of thefe three Days I kill'd
a large Bird that was good to eat, but I know not

what to call it. I ' a . .
- Me. 17. This Day I began to dig behin:' my
Tent into the Rock, to make room for my 'r'a filer
' Conve~
ConvenieneyL Note, Three Things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this Work, mesa Pick-ax, a Shovel'
and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, {0 I defifled from
my Work, and began to confider how to 'fupply
that Want, and make me fome Tools : As for a
Pick'ax, I made ufe of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next
Thing was a Shovel or Spade; this was [0 abfo-
lutely neceffaty, that indeed I could do nothing ef-
fefiually without it; but what kind of one to
make I knew nor, ~

N07). 18. The next Day in {catching the Woods
I found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which
in the Bra/El: they call the Iron Time, for its ex-
ceeding Hardnefs 5 of this, with great Labour
and almofl' {poiling my Ax, I cut a piece, and
brought it Home too with Difliculty enough, for
it was exceeding heavy. -

The exceiiive hardnefs of the Wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this
Machine,- for I work'd it effectually by little
and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade,
the Handle exactly fhap'd like ours in England,
only that the broad Part having no Iron {hod up-
on it at BOttom, it would not lafl: me [0 long;
however it {crv'd well enough for the Ufes which
Iliad Occafion to putit to 5 but never was aSho-
vel, I believe, made after that Fafhion, or {.0
long :1 making,

I was {till deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a
Wheel-barrow; a Basket I could not make by any
means, having no {uch Things as Twigs that would
bend to make Wicker Ware, at 1C3": none yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, Ifancy'd Icould
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion
ol, neither did I know how to go about it; befides
Ihad no poflible way to make the Iron Gudgeons

G 3 forI: 86 l
for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, la
1 gave it over; and lb for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, . I made me a Thing
like a Hcdd which the Labourers carry Mortar in,
when they {erve the Bricklayers, '

This was not [0 diflicult to me as the making
the Shovel 5 and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Atzempt, which-I made in vain, to make a Wheel~
barrow, took me up no lefs than four Days, I mean
alvcays,excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun,
which I feldom fait'd; and very feldom fail'd allo
of bringing home fomething fit to eat.

.Nov. 23. My other Work having now flood {H11i
becaufe of my making thefe Tools; when they
were finilh'd, I went on, and working every Day,
as my Strength and Time allow'd, I {pent eigh-
teen Days entirely in widenirg and deepning my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodif
oufly,

.N('tEUR, During all this Time, I \V'Ol'k'd to make
this Room or Cave {pacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warehoufe or Magazine, a Kitchen,
a Dining-room, and aCellar; as for my Lodging,
I' kept to the Tent, except that fometimes in the
WCt Seafon of the Year, it ram'd {0 hard that I
could not keep my {elf dry, whith caus'd me aftcrm
wards to cover all my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the Form of Rafters, leaning againfl
the Rock, and lead them With Flags, and'large
Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.

Derember 10. I began now tg think my Care
or Vault finifhcd, when on a fildden (it feems ]
had made it too large) a great Qllantity 9f Earth
fell down from the Top and one Side, {0 much,
that in {hart it friglztcd me, and not without Rea-i
{on too; fer-if I had been under it, I had never
granted :1. Grave digger : given this Difallcr 1 had
I ' .. i I ' a great
a great deal of W01k to do own again , for I had
the loofe Earth to any out, and which was of
more Importance, I had the Cicling to prop up, f0
that Imight be fu1e no mom would come down.

Dec. 1 I. T his Day I went to work with it accord--
ingly, and got two Shoars or Pofis pitcl 1 I'd upright
to the Top, with two Pieces of 30111113 a--'cwfs over
each Poll; this I finifll d the next Day , and {etting
more Pofis up with Boa1ds, in about aWeek more
I had the Roof fecur' d; and the Pofls fianding in
Rows, ferv' (1 me for Partitions to part of my Houfe;

Dec. 17 From this Day to the Twentieth I
plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up Nails on the Pofis
to hang e1 cry Thing up that could be hung up,
and now I began to be 111 [0111c Oider within
D0013.

Dec 20. Now I car1y'd every Thing into the
Cave, and began to furnifh my Houl'e and fet up
fome Pieces of Boards, like a Drefler, to order my
V 1&uals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce
111th me; alfo I made me another Table.

Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day,1
{lining out.

Dec. 25. Rain all Day,

Dec. 26. No'Rain, and the Earth much cooler
than before, and pleafanter.

Dec. 27. Killd a young Goat, and lam' d ano-
thei {0 that I catch d 1t, and led it Home 111 a

St1'ri1g,when I had it Home, I bound and {plin-

tcr'd up its Log which was bioke, N. B. I
took fuch cam 01 it, that it li1 'd, and the Leg
giew well and as [hong as met; but by nur'sejfil
it {0 long it gww tame, and red upon the lime
e .-rreen at my D001, and would not go awa y:
1111s 11 as the l' 1P Eime that I enter111111d a
1. 110113.71: of b1ceding up {@1116 tame Creatures,
(J 11 thatthat I might have Food when my Powder and
Shot was all fpent.

.Dec.28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; {0
that there was no flirting abroad, except in the E-.
vening for Food ; this Timel (pen: in putting all
my Things in Order within Doors.

S'anaary 1. Very hot {til}, but Iwcnt abroad ear-
1y andlate with my Gun, and lay [kill in the middle
of the Day 5 this Evening going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Illand,
I found there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding
ihy and hard to come at, hOW-ever I refolv'd to try
if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down.

jam. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, Iwent out
. with my Dog, and {at him upon the Goats; but I
was miflaken, for they all fac'd about upon the
Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he
would i101: come near them, _

39m. 3.31 began my Fence or Wall ; which, being
flill jealous of my being attack'd by {ome Body, I
refolv'd to make very thick and flroiig. ,

N. B. This H/all being defcrz'b'd before, I
purpojely omit what wasjaia' in the jour-
nal; it is fajfident to cbfirrve, that 1 was
no left Time than from the 3d ofJanuary
to the 1 4th oprril, working, finijbing and
pesfefling this Wall, tho' it was no more
than about 24 Third: in Length, being a half
Circle from one Place in the Rock to another
Place about eight Tardrfrom it, the Door
of ' the Cave being in the Center behind it.

All this Time Iwork'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me many Days, nay {ometimes Weeks
gegether; butIthought lihould never be perfeet-
3}! {genre 'till this Wall was finiih'd; and it is

{carce{carce credible what inexpreflible Labour every
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing
Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground; for Imade them much bigger than I
need to have done.

When this Wall was finifh'd, and the Out-fide
double fenc'd with a Turf-Wall rais'd up clofe to
it, Iper'fuaded myfelf, that if any People were to_ .
come on-Shore there, they would not perceive any
Thing like a Habitation ; and it was very well
I did [0, as may be obfetv'd hereafter upon a ve-
ry remarkable Occafion.

During this Timer} made my'Rounds in the
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made Frequent Difcoveries in thefe
Walks of fomething or other to my Advantage;
particularly Ifound a kind of wild Pidgeons, who
built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as Houfe Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks;
and taking fome young ones, 1 endeavour'd to
breed them up tame, and did {0; but when they ',
grew older, they flew all away, which perhaps
was at firfi for Want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to give them 5 however I frequently found
their Neils, and got their young ones, which was '
very good Meat.

And now in the managing my Houfliold Affairs,
Ifound my {elf wanting in many Things, which
I thought at firPc it was impdflible for me to make,
as indeed as to fome of them it was 5 for Inflam-e, I
could never make a Cask to be hoop'd, I hada .
{mall Runlet or two, on I obfew'd before, but I
cou'd never arrive to the Capacity of making one _
by them, tho' I {pent many Weeks about it; I \
could neither put in the Heads, or joint the Staves

{0 true to oneanorher, as to make them hold Wa~
ter, [0 I gave that alfo over.

In
In the next Place,I was at a great Lofs for Can-L

11,111,121 that as {0011 as ever. it was dark, which was
generally by 8121' En a Clock, I was oblig' d to go to
Bed: I remember the Lump of Bees-wax 11 1th
which I made Candles in my African Adventure,
but I had mom of that now; the only Remedy I
1111111111 that when I had kill d a Goat, I fav' (1
the Tallow, and with a little Dim made of Clay,
which I bak 'd 111 the Sun, to which I added a Wick
of Iome Oaknm, I made me a Lamp; and this
gave me Light, tho' not a clear Ready Light like
a Candle; in the middle of all my Labouis 1t hap ~
pen ',d that rummarring 111y' Things, I found alittle
Ba ag, which, 1131 hii'ted before, had been fill'd with
Com for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Vo-
yage, but before, as I fupp ofe, when the Ship
came from Lisbon , what little Remaindei of Corn
.had been in the Bag, 11213 all devour'd with the
Rats, and. I {aw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Duff; and being willing to have the Bag for fume
other Ufe, I think it w as to put Powder 111, when
I divided 1t for {can of the Lightning, or form: fuch
Ufe, I mook the Husks of Com out of it on one
Side of my Feitification under the Rock.

It Was a little befme the great Rains, jufi new
mention 'd, that I thiew this Stuff may aL111gno
Notice of any '1' 1111113, and not Io much as remem-

bring that I had th1own any I' hing there, when
about a Menth after, or theren about, I {aw fome
' few Stalks of poinething Green {booting out of the
Ground, 1*. hich I I1: 11cy'd might be fome Plant I

It is impoffihle to exprefs the Aflonilhment and
Confufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion;, I
had hitherto ae'ted upon no religious Foundation at
all,- indecd I had very few Notions of Religion in
my Head, 'or had entertain-'51 any Senfe of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleafes God ;
without {0 much as enquiring into the End of Pro~
vidence in thefe Things, or his Order in gover-
ning Events in the World; But after I {aw Barley
grow there, in a Climate which I know. was not
properrfor Corn, and efpecially that I knew not
how it came there, it fiartled me firangely, and I
began to fu-ggel'c, that God had miraculoufly caus'd
this Grain to grow WithOut any help of Seed
form, and that it was {0, diree'ced purely for my
Snflenancc on that wild miferable Place. '

This touch'd my Heart a little, and. brought
-Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to'blcis my
(elf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature {hould lit-neon

'.- .
' 11.1.

A

upon my Account; and this was the more itrange
to me, becaufe I {aw near it {till all along by the
Side of the Rock, fome other firaggling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice. and Which I
knew, became I had feen it grow in Africa, when
I was afhore there. '

I not only thought thefc the pure Produfi'ions
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was more in the Place. 5 I went all
over that part of the Ifland, where I had been
before peering, in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to fee for more of it, but I could not find
any; at laft it occurr'd to my Thoughts, that I had
{hook a Bag of Chic-liens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to ceafe; and I mult
confefs, my religious Thankfulncfs to God's Pro~
iridence began to abate too upon the difcove-

ring
.; ring that all this was norhing but what was com:
.mon gtho'I ought to have been as thankful for [0

flrange and untorefeen Providence, as if it had

. been miraculous; for it was really the Work of
Providence as to me, that fhould order or appoint,

., that IO or ,12 Grains of Corn fliould remain un--
{poil'd (when the Rats had defh'oy'd all the refl)

. as if it had been drapt from Heaven: As alio thatI

. Should throw it out in that particular Place where
it beingin the Shade ofa high Rock, it {prang up
immediately; whereas if I had thrown it any
where elfe at that Time, it had been burnt up and
defiroy'd.

, I carefully fav'd tthars of this Corn, you may be.
fure in their Seafon, which was about the End of

gum, and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd to {ow
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome
Qy'antity fuflicient to {apply me with Bread; but
. it was not till the 4th Year thatI could allow my
{elf the leal't Grain of this Corn to eat, and even
then but fparingly, as I {hall fay afterwards in its
Order; for Iloit all thatI fow'd the firft Seafon,
by not obferving the proper Time for Ii'ow'd it
infl: before the dry Seafon, {0 that it never came
up at all, at leait, not as it would have done: Of
which {hits Place.

. Belides this Barley, there was, as above 20 or
30 Stalks oFRic-c, which I preferv'd with the fame
Care, and whole 'Uie was of the fame Kind, or to

. the fame Przrpofe, (one) to make me Bread, or
rather Food ; for}: found Ways to cook it up with--
out belting, tho' I did that allo after {ome Time.
Put to return to my Journal.

I worlfid excelfire hard thefe three or four
Months to get my Well done; and the 14th of
.A'pril Iclofed it up, contriving to go into it, nor
'07 a Door, but eve the Wall by :1 Ladder, Ithat

' tiere
there might be no Sign in the Out-fide of my Ha~
bitation.

Agni! 16.1finifli'd the Ladder, {0 I went up with
the Ladder to the T09, and then pull 'd it up after
me, and let it down on the Infide: his was a
compleat Enclofure to me; for'vithin I had Room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with
out, unlefs it could fi1ll mount my Wall

The very next Dty alter this Wall was flnifhed,
I had almofl had all my Labour overthrown at
once, and myfell kill 'd , the Cafe was thus: As I
'was bufy 111 the Infide of 1t, behind my Tent, jufl' 111
the Entrance into my Cave, 1 was terribly irighted
'with a mail: dreadful flirprizing Thing indeed;
for all on a hidden Ifound the Ea1th come cm 111--
biing down from the Roof otmy Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of
the Polls 1 had {et up in the Cave, crack "d 1n 3
frighttul manner: Iwas heartily feared, butthought
nothing of what was 1eally the Caufe, only think"-
ing that the top of my Cave was falling 1n, as fame
of it had done betore , and for fear I 111011 'd be bu"
I'y d in it, I ran touvard to my Ladder, and not
thinking my {elf fafe their neithe1,lg0t over my
Wall for fear of the Pieces of the Hi. lb \\ hich I Cr-
peeted mightiol ll do", 11 upon me.- I was no fooner
fiept down upon the firm Ground, but} plainly
{aw it was a terrible Earthquake, 101 the Ground I
flood 011 thOk three times at about eight Mie
nutes difiance, with th ee inch Shocks, as would
have ovm turned the Itrongell Buildii: g that could
be hippos d to ha1e Hood on the Larth, and a
g1eat Piece of the Top of a Rock, which flood :1-
.bouthalf Milt 110m me next the Sea, fell down
with inch a teiible Noife, as Incxer heard 111 all
my Life: I peiceiv d alfo, the very S awas put
into violent Motion by it, and I 1;>>le re the

Shock[9H,

Shocks w'ere manger under the Water than on flie-
mand. . . . . _. .
1w f0 afhai'd With the Thing; it 1231f, having
never $81!: the like, or difco'urfed With any Orze that
had, thatlw'as like one dead or frup'ify'd -, and the
Motion of the Earth iiiade my" Stemach fick, like
One that was tofe'd at Sea; but the Noife of the
falling ofth'e Rock aW'akfl me, as it were", and rou-
zing me from the fiupified Co'nditiOn I was in, fill'd
me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then
but the Hill falling upon my Tent, and all my Houil
hold Goods, and burying all at Once; and this
funk my very Soul within me a fizcond time.

After the third Shock was over, and If'elt no
more for fome time, Ib'egan to take Courage, and
yet I had not Heart enough to get over my Wall a-'
gain, for fear of being buried alive, but {at {till
upon theGrbund, greatly cafc doWn and diieonfo-
late, not knowing what to do i All this While I had
not the leafi ferious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ba' [Mercy upon me 3 and
when it was over, that Went away too. .

Whilel fat thus, I found the Air over-cafi, and
grew cloudy, as if it would rain-7 foon after that .-
the Wind rofe by little and little, f0 that in leis
than half an Hourit blewamofl dreadful Hurri-
cane: The Sea was all On a fudden Cover'd OVer
" with Foam and Froth, the Shore was COVCr'd with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were tOrn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and
this held abOut three Hours, and then began to
abate, and in two Hours more it was calm, and
began to rain very hard; .

All this while I {at neon the Grdund very much .
terriiy'd and dejeehed, when ona ihdden it Came
into my Thoughts, that thefe Winds and Rain being
the Confequence of the Earthquake, the Earthquake

itlelf.. [9;] .
itf'elf was (pent and over, and Imight venture into
my Cave again: "With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive, and the Rain alfo helping to per-
iivade me, I went in and fat down in my Tent,
but the Rain was f0 violent, that my Tent was
ready to be beaten down with it; andeas forc'd
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un--
ealy for Fear it fliould fall on my Head.

This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, via.
to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a
Sink to let Water go out, which w0uld elie have
drown'd my Cave. AfterI had been in my Cave
ibme Time, and found fiill no more Shocksof the
Earthquake follow, Ibegan to be more compos'd;
and now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed want-
ed it very much, I went to my little Store, and
took a final} Sup of Rum, which however I did
then and always very fpa1'~ingly, knowing Icould
have no more when that was gone. .

It continu'd raining all that . Night, and great
Part of the next Day, f0 that I could not fiir
abroad, but my'Mind being more compos'd, Ibe--
gan to think of what I had befl: dp, concluding,

3that if the Ifland was fubjee'c to thele Earthquakes,
there Would be no living for 'me ina Cave, butI
'mufi confider of building me fome little Hut in an
open Place, whichl might furround with a Wall as
Ihad done here, and fo make my felf fecure from
wild 8821113 or Men: But concluded, if I flaid

where I was, Ifhould certainly, one Time or other,
be bury'd alive. . '- - "
_ With thefe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my
Tent from the Place where it flood, which was
iuf'c under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and
which, if it {hould be fliaken'again, would certain-
ly fall upon my Tent: And lfpent the two next
- ~ Days
Days, being the r 9th and 20th of 2415117, in don'-
triving where and how to remove my Habitation.-
, The Fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made
"me that I never flew in Qliet; and yet the Appre-
henfion, of lying abroad without any Fence, was
almoii equal to it: But fiill when lloOk'd about,
and. {aw how every Thing was put in Order, how
pleal'antly conceal'd I was, and how fafe from
Danger, it made me very loth to remove.

In the mean time it occurr'd to me,that it WOuId
require a vafi deal of Time for me to do this, and
that I muft be contented to run the Venture where
Iwas, 'till Ihad form'd a Camp for myfelf, and
had fecut'd it {o as to remove to it: So with this
Refolution I compos'd myfelf for a Time, and re-
folv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to
build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, (9%. in a
Circle as before, and {et my Tent up in it when it
was finifh'd, but that Iwould venture to Pray where

'1 was 'till it was finifh'd and fit to remove to. This
was the cuff.

April 22. The next MorningI began to confider
of Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I
was at a great Lois about my Tools 5 I had three
.large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we
carry'd the Hatchets for Traflick with the Indians)
but with much chopping; and cutting knOtty hard
'Wood, they were all all of Notches and dull,
.an'd tho'I had a Grindflone, Icould not turn it and-
grind my Tools too; this colt me as much Thought
as a Statefman would have befiow'd upon a grand-
'Point of Politicks, ora Judge upon the Life and
Death of a Man. At length I contriv'd a Wheel .
.with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I.
might have both my Hands at Liberty: Note,I had
never feen any fuch thing in England, or at leafi:
not. to rake Notice how it was done, tho' fifice I

avehave ohferv'd it is very common there: Befidcs
that, my Grind~Ptone was very large and heavy.
This Machine colt me a full \Veek's Work to bring
it to Perfection.

Jpn/[2.8, 2.9. Thefe two whole Days I took up
in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning
my Grind-iione performing very well.

flprtz'l 30. Having perceiv'd my Bread had been
low a great while, now I took a Survey of it, and

'reduc'd myfelf to one Bisket-cake a Day, which
made my Heart'vcry heavy.

[Way I. In the Morning looking towards the
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, I faw fomething lie
on the Shore bigger than ordinary; and it look'd
like a Cask; when I came to it, I found a fmall
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late
Hurricane; and looking towards the Wreck itfelf,
I thought it feem'd to. lie higher outof the Water,
that it us'd to do; I examin'd the Barrel which
was driven on Shore, and foon found it was a
Barrel of Gun-powder 3 but it had taken Water,
'and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone 5 how-
ever I roll'd it farther on Shore for the prefent, and
went on upon the Sands as near as 1 could to the
Wreck of the Ship to look for more.

When I came down to the Ship,I found it {hange-
ly remov'd; the Fore-cafile, which lay before bu-i
ry'd in Sand, was heav'd up at leafi; fix Foot ; and
the Stern, which was broke to pieces, and parted

' from the wit by the Force of the Sea foon after I
had left rummaging her, was tofs'd, as it were, up,
and call: on one Side, and the Sand was thrown
fo high on that fide next her' Stern, that whereas
there was a great Place of Water before, fo that I
could not come within a Q_uarter of a Mile of the
Wreck without fwimming, I could now walk .
H ' ' quite
quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was fur.
priz'd with this at firf't, but foon concluded it mull
be done by the Earthquake: And as by this Violence
the Ship was more broken open than formerly, {0
many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea
had loofen'd, and which the Winds and Water rol-
led by degrees to the Land.

This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Defign of removing my Habitation; and I bufied
myfelf mightily, that Day efpecially, in {catching
whether I could make any way into the Ship; but I
found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for
that all the lnfide of the Ship was choak'd up
with Sand 5 However, as I had learnt not to defpair
of any thing, I refolv'd to pull every thing to
pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding, that
every thing I could get from her, would be offome
Ufe or other to me. '

May 3. I begun with my Saw, and cut a Piece
of aBearn thro', which I thought held fome of the
upper Part or Quarter-Deck together, and when
I had cut it thro', I-clear'd away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay highefi; but
the Tide coming in, 1 was obliged to give over
for that Time.

May 4. I went a fifhing, but caught notone Fifh
that I duri't eat'oF, till I was weary of my Sport;
when jult going to'leave OH", I caught a young
Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of fome
Repe Yarn, but 'I had no Hooks, yetI frequently
caught Fifh enough, as much as I car'd to eat;
all which I dry'd' in the Sun, and eat them dry. '

[my f. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another
Beam afunder, and' brought three great Fir Planks
of'ffrom the Decks, which I t-y'd together, and
made fwim on Shore, when the Tide of Flood

came on. -
3; May
May 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got l'everal Iron
Bolts out of her, and other Pieces of Iron-work 3,
work'd very hard, and came Home Very much
tir'd, and had Thoughts of giving it over.

.May7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work; but found the Weight of the
Wreck had broke itfelfdown, the Beams being cut -,
that feveral Pieces of the Ship feem'd to lie loofe,
and the Infide of the Hold lay (0 open, that I.
could feeinto it, but almoll full of W'ater and Sand.

May 8. Went to the W reek, and carry'd an Iron
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wreneh'd Open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alfo with
the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day.

May 9. Went to the W'reck,and with the Crow
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felt
feveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow,
but could not break them up; I felt alfo the Roll
of Eagle/b Lead, and could fiir it, but'it was too
heavy to remove.

May to, I I, 17., 13, t4. Went every Day to the
Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Tim-
ber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 W eight
of Iron.

.May If. I earry'd two Hatchcts to try if I
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it
with the other; but as it lay about 21 Foot and a
half in the water, Icould not make any Blow to
drive the Hatchet. _

[Way 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and
the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of
the Water; but] ltaid f0 longinthe Woods to get

Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me
gomg to the Wreck that Day.

H 2. [Way
May 1-7. I law fome pieces of the Wreck blown
on Shore,- at a great Dif'tance, near two Miles off
'me, but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found
it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me
to bring away.

May 2.4. Every Day to this Day I work'd on
the Wreck and with hard Labour I loofim'd fome
Things [0 much with the Crow, that the firft
blowing Tide feveral Cask's floated out, and two
of the Seamens Chefis; but the Wind blowing from
the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but
Pieces of Timber, and a Hogihead which had fome
Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand
had fpoil'd it.

I continu'd this Work every Day to the I ftl'l of
yum, except the Time necefl'ary to get Food,
which I always appointed, during this Part of my
Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I
might be ready when it was ehb'd out 3 and by this
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-
work enough, to have built a good Boat, if I
had known how; and alfo, I got at {everal Times,
and in feveral Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-
I.cad. ' ,

'j'zme 16. Going down to the Sea-fide, I found
a large Tortml'e or Turtle; this was the firlt I had
feen, which it feems was only my Misfortune, not
any Defeet of the Place, or Scarcity; for hadI
happen'd to be on the other Side ofthe Ifland, I
might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as

[- l-ound afterwards; but perhaps had paid clear
enough for them.

found in her threefcore Eggs; and herFlefhwas to
me at that Time the molt favoury and pleafant

rid Place. .

or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell afleep,
and did not wake till far in theNight 5 when I wak'd,
I found myfelf much refi'efh'd, but weak, and ex-
ceeding thirf'ty: However, as I had no Water in
my whole Habitation, Iwas Forc'd to lie till Morn-

ing, and went to {leep again: In this fecond Sleep,
I had this terrible Dream. '

Ithought, that I was fitting on the Ground on
the Out-lide of my W all, where I {at when the
Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I law
a Man de'fcend from a great black Cloud, in a
bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground ;
He was all over as bright as a Flame, [0 that I ,
could bu: jufl: bear to look towards him; his
Countenance was moft inexpreflibly dreadful, im-
POfllblC {01' VVOI'ClS t0 (leCl'le3 when he fi-ep'd up.
' on the Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth
trembl'd, jufl: as it had done before in the Earth-
quake, and all the Air look'd to my Apprehenfion,
as if it had been fill'd with Flames of Fire.

He was no {boner landed Upon the Earth, but
he mov'd forward towards me, with a long Spear
or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me 5 and when he
came to a rifing Ground, at {ome Diltance, he
fpoke to me, or I heard a Voice {'0 terrible, that
it is impofiible to exprels the Terrorof it s all that
I can fay I underflood W83 t1lis, Seeing all z'befi:

the Spear that was in his Hand to kill me; _

No one, that {hall ever read this Account, will
expcet that Ifhould be able to defcribe tth'orrors
of my Soul atthis tCl'l'lblC Vifion' I mean,~;that even
while it was a Dream, I even dreamedof thofe
Horrors 5 nor is It anymore pofiible todcfcribe

. ' ' ' the
the Impreflion that remain'd upon my Mind, when
I awak'd, and found it was but a Dream. _

Ihad alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had re-
ceiv'd by the good Infiruetion of my Father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of
feafaring Wickednefs, and a coni'rant Converfation
with nothing but Inch as were like myfelf, wicked
and prophane to the hit Degret: I do not remem-
berthat I had in all that time one Thought that (0
much as tended either to looking ugiwards toward
God, or inwards towards a Refle ion upon my
own Ways: But a certain Stupidity of Soul, 'with-'
out Defire oF Good, or Confcience of Evil,had en-
tirely overwhelm'd me, and I was all that the mod:
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our
common Sailors can be fuppos'd to be, not having
the leai't Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Dan-
ger, or of Thankfulnefs to God in Deliverances.

In the relating what is already pail of my Story,
.this will be the more eafily believed, when I {hall
add, that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had to much
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
that it was a juf't Punifhm'ent for my Sin, my re-
bellious Behaviour againi'c my Father, or my pre-
fent Sins which were great 5 orfo much as a Punifh-
ment for the. general Courie of my wicked Life.
When 1 was on the defperate Expedition on the de-
fert Shores of dfrim, linevcr had lb much as one
Thought of what would become of me; or one
Wifh to God to direet me whither Ifhould go, or to
keep me from the Dangerwhich apparently fur-
ronnded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages: But I was meerly thoughtlefs of a'
God, or a Providence; aficd like-a meer Brute
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Dietates
of common Senfe only, and indeed hardly that"

H 4. When
.When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by the
_ Portugal Captain, well us'd, and dealt jufily and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the leaft Thankfulnefs on'my Thoughts: When
again I was fhipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in danger of
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far from Re-
morfe, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only {aid
to myfelf often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and
born to be always miferablc. >>

It is true, when I got on Shore firft here, and
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd , and my
felf fpar'd, I was furpriz'd with a kind-of Extafy,
and form T ranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace
of God aflified, might have come up to true Thank-
fulncf33 but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight ofjoy, or, as I may fay, being glad I
was alive, without the leal't Refleetion upon the
diflinguifliing Goodneis of the Hand which had
preferv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre-
ferv'd, when all the refi: were deiln'oy'd : or an En-
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me; evenjuft the fame common fort ofjoy which
Seainen generally have after they are got fafe aihore
from aShipwreck, which they drown all in the next
Bowl of Punch, and forget almofi as foon as it is
over; and all the reft of my Life was like it.

Even, when I was afterwards, on. due Confide-
ration, made fenfible of my Condition, how I was

cafi on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of .

humane Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Profpeet

of Redemption, as foon as I faw {but a Profpeei: of

living, and that I Ihould not I'tarve and perifh for

Hunger, all the Senfe of my Afiiietion wore oil",
and I begun to be very eafy, apply'dm'yfelf to the:

Works proper for my Prefervation and Supply, and

was far enough from being afflicted at my:Con-:

dition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as the
Hand
Hand of God againfl me; thefe were Thoughts
which very feldom enter'd into my Head. . g .

The growing up of the Corn, as IS 11111th 1n
my Journal, had at 51'": fome little Influence upon
me, and began to affect me with Serioufnefs, as
long as I thought it had fomething miraculous in
it; but as foot) as ever that part of the Thought
was remov'd, all the Imprefiion which was rais'd
from it, wore OFF alfo, as l have noted already.

Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
directing to the invifible Power, which alone di-
rects fuch things 5 yet no fooner was the firf't Fright,
over, but the lmpreflion it had made went OFF alfo;
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments,
much lefs of the prefent Affliction of my Circum-
fiances being from his Hand, than if I had been in
the moft profperous Condition of Life.

But now when Ibegan to be fick, and a leifure-
ly View of the Miferies of Death came to place it-
felf before me; when my Spirits began to link un4
der the Burden of a firong Diflemper, and Nature
was exhaufied with the Violence of the Fever;
Confcience that had flcpt {'0 long, begun to aWake,
and I began to reproach myfelf with my pail Life,
in which I had fo evidently, by uncommon Wic-
kednel's, provok'd the Jufiice of God to lay me
under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in
fo vindictive a manner.

Thefe Reflections opprefs'd me for the fecond or
third Day of my Diflemper, and in the Violence,
as well of the Fever, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me,-
like praying to God, tho' I cannot fay they were
either a "Prayer attended with Defires or 'with
Hopes; it was rather the Voice of mere Fright
and;Dif't1'efs3' my Thoughts were confus'd, the

Con- _ l
Convieirions great upon my Mind, and the Horror
of dying in fuch a miferable Condition rais'd Va~
pours into my Head with the mere Apprehenii~
ons; and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know not
what my Tongue might exprefs; but it was ra-
ther Exclamation, fuch as, Lord! robot 4 mifemole
Creature am I? If I flaould be flak, 1/7941] certainly
die-for team of Help, and who; will become of me!
Then the Tears buri't out of my Eyes, and I could
fay no more for a good while.

In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
came to my Mind, and prefently his Predietiori,
which I mentioned at the Beginning of this Story,
viz. That if I did take this fooliflo Step, God would not
ole/i me; and I would have lei/are hereafter to refleo}
upon lowing negleoi'eo' lair Coomfel, when there might be
ozone to afifl in my Recovery Now, faid I aloud,
My dear Father's Words are come to pafs: God's
Jufiicc has overtaken me, and I have none to help
or hear me: I rejeeted the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Pofiure or Sta-
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy and
eafy; but I would neither fee it myfelf, or learn
to know the Blefling of it from my Parents : I left
them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left
to mourn under the Confequences of it. I refus'd
their Help and Afliflance who would have lifted me
into the World, and wou'd have made every thing
eafy to me, and now I have Difiiculties to firuggle
with, too great for even Nature itfelf to fupport,
and no Aflii'cance, no Help, no Comfort, no Ad-
vice: Then I cry'd our, Lord be my Help, for 1 em
in great Di/irefi.

This was the firft Prayer, if I may call it (0,
that I had made for many Years: But I return te
my Journal,

' 7am"
394% 28. Having been fomewhat refrefh'd with
the Sleep Iliad had, and the Fit being entirely
off, I got up 3 and tho' the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next
Day, and now was my Time to get fomething to
refreih and fupport myfelf when I fllould be ill;
and the fil'fl: Thing I did, I fill'd a large fquare
Cafe Bottle with Water, and fet it upon my Ta-
ble, in Reach of my Bed 3 and to take of? the chill
or aguiih Dilpofition of the Water, I putabout
a (barter of 21 Pint of Rum into it, and mix'd .
them together; then I got me a Piece of the
Goat's Flefh, and broil'd it on the Coals, but
could eat very little; I walk'd about, but was very
weak, and withal very fad and heavy-hearted in
the Senfe of my miferable Condition; dreading
the Return of my Difiemper the next Day; at
Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's
Eggs, which I mailed in the Afhes, and eat, as we
call it, in the Shell; and this was the fil'll: Bit of
Meat I had ever ask'd God's Blefiing to, even as I.
cou'd remember in my whole Life.

After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found.
myfelf f0 weak that I cou'd hardly carry the
Gun, (for I never went out without that 3) [0 I
went but a little Way, and {at down upon the
Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth: As I
fat here, fome 'fuch Thoughts as thefe occur'd to
me. . ' _

What is this Earth and Sea of which I have feen
fo much, whence is it produc'd, and what am I, and
all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane and
brutal, whence are we? - 7

Sure '
.Sure we are all made by fome fecret Power,

who form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky 5 -
and who is that?
. Then it follow'd moi't naturally, It is God that
has made it all: Well, but then it came on firangely,
if God has made all thefe Things, He guides and
governs them all, and all Things that concern
them; for the Power that could make all Things,
mull certainly have Power to guide and direft
them.

If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit
"of his Works, either without his Knowledge or
Appointment.

And if nothing happens without his Knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful
Condition; and if nothing happens without his
Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal
me.

Nothing occur'd to my Thought to contradie'c
any of thefe Conclufions; and therefore it relied
upon me with the greater Force, that it mull needs
be, that God had appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miferable Circumfiance
by his Direetion, he having the fole Power, not of
me only, but of every Thing that happen'd in the
World. Immediately it follow'd,

W by has God done this to me ? What have I done
to he that: us'd ?

My Confcience prefently check'd me in that En-
quiry, as if I had blafphem'd, and methought it
{poke to me like aVoice; IVRE TC H! daft thou
ask what thou hafl done .' look back upon a dreadful
mif-fpent Life, and ask thy felf what that; heft not
done ? ask, Why is it that thou were not long ago de-
flroy'd? Why wert than not drown?! in Yarmouth
Roads? Kill'd in the Fight when the 8th was taken by
the Salle Man of War? Devour'd by the wildBeafls

an
an the Coafi of Africa? Or Drown?! HERE,
when all the Crew perz'fb'd [gut thy/Elf? Doft thou
ask, [IV/mt have I done ?

I was {'truck dumb with thefe Reflections, as one
af'toniih'd, and had not a Word to fay, no not
to anfwer to myfelf, but rofc up penfive and fad,
walk'd back to my Retreat, and Went up over my
Wall, as if I had been going to Bed ; but my
Thoughts were fadly diflurb'd, and I had no In-
clination to fleep; (0 I fat down in my Chair,
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark:
Now as the Apprehenfion of the Return of my Di- '
{temper terrify'd me very much, it occur'd to my
Thought, that the Brafiliam take no Phyfick but
their Tobacco for almol't all Diftempers; and I
had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the
Cheits, which was quite cur'd, and fome alfo that
Was green and n0t quite cut'd.

I went, direeted by Heaven no doubt; for in
this Chel't I fOund a Cure both for Soul and Body ;
I open'd the Chef't, and found what I look'd for, 'viz.
the Tobacco; and as the few Books, I had fav'd,
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had
not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination to
look into 5 I fay, I took it out, and brought both
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table.

W hat Ufe to make of the Tobacco, Iknew not,
as to my Dif'temper, or whether it was good for it
or no; bUt I try'd feveral Experiments with it, as
if .I was refolv'd it ihould hit one Way or other:
I firfi took a Piece of a Leaf, and cheW'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at firfl almofl fiupify'd my
Brain, the Tobacco being green and firong, and
that I had not been much us'd to it 3 then I took
Come and fleep'd it an Hour or two in fome Rum,
and refolv'd to takeaDofe of it when Ilay down 5

3 andI:: no]

, and laflly, I burnt .fome upon a Pan 0F Goals, and
held my Nol'e clofe over the Smoke of it as long as
I could bear it, as wellfor the Heat as almoft for
Sufi'ocation. '

In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
_ much diflurb'd with the Tobacco to bear.reading,
at leafl; that Time 3 only having opcn'd the Book
cafually, the firf't Words that occur'd to me were
thefe, Call on me in the Day of Trouble, and I will
deliver, and thou jlaalt' glorify me. I

The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made
fome Impreflion upon my Thoughts at the Time of
reading them, tho' not fo much as they did after-
wards ; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Sound, as I may flay, to me; theThing was {0 remote,
fo impoflible in my Apprehenfion of Things, that
, I began to fay as the Children of [fmel did, when
they were promis'd Fleih to eat, Cam Godfpread a
Table 2.7} "96' Mldei'nefi .9 {O I began to fay, Can God
himfelf deliver me from this Place? and as it was
not for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this
prevail'd very often upon my Thoughts: But
however, the Words made a great Impreflion upon
me, andI mufed upon them very often. I: grew
' now late, and the Tobacco had, as I laid, doz'd
my Head {0 much, that I inclin'd to fleep; f0 1
left my Lamp burning it} the Cave, left I fhould
want any Thing in the N ight, and went to Bed;
but before I lay down, I dld What 1 never had done
in all my Life, I_ kneel'd down and pray'd to God
to fulfil the Promife to me, that if 1 call'd upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he Would deliver me; af-
ter my broken and impel'fcai Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in VVhICh I had flecp'd [he Tobac.
co, which was fo firong and rank of the Tobacco,
that indeed I could fcarce get It down 5 immediately

upon
upon thisI went to Bed, I found prekintlyit flew
up in my Head violently, but I fell into a found
Sleep, and wak'd no more, till by the Sun it mufl:
neceflarily be near three a-Clock in the Afternoon
the next Day, nay, to this Hour I'm partly of the
Opinion, that I flept all the next Day and Night,
and till almoit three that Day after, for other-
wife I knew not how-I ihould lofe a Day om of my
Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appear'd
fome Years after I had done ; For if I had lofl; it by
crofling and recrofiing the Line, I fltould have loft
more than one Day: But certainly I loft a Day in _
my Account, and never knew. which'Way.

Be that however-one way or t'other, when I
awak'd I found myfelf exceedingly refrefh'd, and
my Spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up, I .
was fironge'r than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in fllort, I
had no Fit the neXt Day, but continu'd much al-
ter'd for the better; this was the 29th.

The 30th was my Well-day of courfe, and I.
went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too far. I kill'd a Sea~Fowl or two, fome-
thing like a Brand-Goofe, and brought them home,
but was not very forward to eat them; fo I eat fome
' more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good: '
This Evening I renew'd the Medicine which Ih'ad
fuppos'd did me good the day before, 'vz'z. theTobac be _
co fleep'd in Rum, only 1 did not take fo much as 4
before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold my '
Head over the Smoke 5 however, I was not ['0 well>>
the next Day, which was the firfl: of y'all}, as I hop'd
I fhould have been 5 for I had a little Spice of the
cold Fit, but it was not much. .

f7uly z. .I renew'd the Medicine all the three
Ways, and doz'd my felf with it as it firfl; and
doubled the QJantity which I drank. -\;Z..Q_ -

g. I mifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho' I did
not recover my full Strength for fome W eeks after:
While I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, I will deliver
thee; and the Impoflibility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind in Bar of my ever expe&ing
it: But as I was difcouraging myfelf with fuch
Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored
'fo much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli~
fiion, that I difregarded the Deliverance I had re-
ceiv'd; and I was, as it were, made to ask my
{elf fuch Qief'tions as thefe, viz. Have I not been
deliver'd, and wonderfully too, from Sicknefs? from
the mofl: diftreifed Condition that could be, and
that was fo frightful to me, and what Notice
had I taken of it? Had I done my part, God lead de-
. Zi'vered me; but I [and not glorified him; that is to fay,
I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a
Deliverance, and how could I expeet greater De-
liverance?

_ This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneel'd down, and gave God Thanks a-
loud for my Recovery from my Sicknefs.

3'2er 4. In the Morning 1 took the Bible, and be-
ginning at the New Teitament, I began ferioufly
to read it, and impos'd upon myfelf to read a-
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
myfelf to the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts {hould engage me: It was not long
after I fet ferioufly to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and fincerely affected with
the Wickednefs of my pai'c Life : The Im-
preflion of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, All
zbeflz things have not erozegbt thee to Repentance, ran
ferioufly in my Thought: I was earnefily begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happen'd
providentially the very Day that reading the Scrip-
ture,
ture, I came to thefe Words, He is exalted a Prince
and a Saviour, to give Repentance, ana'z'ogz've Rennfi-
on. I threw down the Book, and with my Heart
as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a
Kind of Extafy of Joy, I cry'd out aloud, Jefus,
1170a Son of David, Jefits, t/aon exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me Repentance!

This was the firll Time that I-could lay, in the
true Senfe of the Words, that I pray'd in all my Life 5
for now I pray'd with a Smile of my Condition,
and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded
on the Encouragement of the Word of God; and
from this Time, I may fay, I began to have Hope
that God would hear me.

Now I began to confirm: the Words mentioned
above, Call on me, and 1 will deliver you, in a diffe-

--a:':thtfhtt'ttcneltritmfi'lartl'v:J. 'G'tiC'iG'EfOfU'f'fift"""deg '
then Ihad no Notion of any thing being call'd De-
liverance, but my being delivcr'd from the Captis
vity I was in; for tho' I was indeed at large
in the Place, yet the Ifland was certainly a
Prifon to me, and that in the wori't Senfe in the
World; but now I learn'd to take it in another
Senle: Now 1 look'd back upon my pafl: LiFe with
{uch Horror, and my Sins appear"d {o dreadful,
that my Soul fought nething of God, but Delive-
rance From the Load of Guilt that bore down all my
Comfort: As for my {olitary Life it was nothing 5
I did not fo much as pray to be deliver'd from it,
or think ofit; it was all of no Confideration in
Comparifon to this; And I add this Part here,-to
hint to whoever {hall read it, that whenever they
come to a true Senfe of things, they will find De-
liverance from Sin a much greater BleIIing, than De-
liveranCe From Afidie'tion. -

But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal.

I'Vly[114-]? '

My Cbnd'itionz began now to be, tho' not let's mi-r
ferable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier
to my'Mind ;- and my Thoughts being direeted,-by'
a,conf'rant reading the Scripture and praying to
God, to things ofa higlger Nature; I had a great
deal of Comfortzavithin, fwhich till now Ilsnew no-
thing'of; alfdrifi- yifH'ealth and Strength returned,

FrOm the 4.th of 7m to the 14th, I was chiefly
employ'd in walking about with myGun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of
Sicknefs: For it. is hardly to beimagin'd, how low
- I was, and to what Weaknei's I was r_educ'd. The
Application which I made Ul'eiofjfis perfeetly
new, and perhaps what had never: e'ur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
praetife, by this Experiment; and tho' it did carry
off the Fit, yet it rather contributed'to weakening
me 3 for l-had frequent Convulfions in- my Nerves
and Limbs for fome Time. -

I, learnt from it alfo this in particular, that be~
ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the mo-Pt pernici-
ous thing to my Health that could be, efpecially in
thofe Rains which came attended with Storms and
Hurricanes of Wind ; for as the Rain which came
in the dry Seafon wasalways molt accompany'd
with fuch Storms, fo Ifound that Rain was much
more dangerous than the Rain which fell in Sep'
tember and Offober.

I had been now in this unhappy Ifland almoft Io.
Months, all Poflibility of Deliverance from this '
Condition feem'd to be entirely taken from me;
and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had
ever fet Foot upon that Place: Having now fecur'd

my

my Habitation, as I thou/glagggullyfitflo my Mind, I
had a great Defire to ma'eef"'a'more'ifperfe& Difco-
very of the Ifland,' and to fee what other Produfig-
tio'ns I might find, which I yet knew nothing
of. *

It Was the 17th of ffuly that I <<began to take a
more particular Survey of the Ifland it felf: I went
up the Creek firii, where, as I hinted, I brought:
my Rafts on Shore; Ifound after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
higher,- and that it was no -.more _ than a little
Brook of running Water, and very hell) and good 3
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly any
Water in fome Parts of it, at half, not enough to
run in any Stream, (0 as-it could be perceiv'd.

On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea-
i'ant Saw/M's, or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and
cover'd with Grafs; and on the rifing Parts of
them mom to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflow'd,
I found a great deal of Tobacco, green and'growing
to a great and very flrong Stalk 3 there were di-
vers other Plants which Ihad no Notion of, or Un-
derflanding about, and might perhaps have Vir--
. tues oi'their own, which I could not find out.

I {carched for the Caflewa Root, which the [71-
diam in all that Climate make their Bread of,but I
could find none. I {aw large Plants of Aloes, but
did not then underfiand them. I {aw feveral Sugar
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myfelf with thefe Difcoveries
for this Time, and came back mufing with my'
{elf what Courfc I might take to know the Virtue
and Goodneis of any of the Fruits or Plants which
I ihould difcover; bUt could bring it to no Con-
clulion; for in fhort, I had made fo little Obfers-
vation while I' was in the Bra/21$, that I knew little

I: - ofafi--lfi 11 {j G--"fl

of the Plants in -the..F~ield, at leafl very little that
might ferve me to any'Purpofe now in my Dif-
trefs. '

The next Day, the 16th, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going {omething farther than
I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and
the Seaman's began to ceaie, and the Country be-
came more woody than before 5 in this Part I Found
difi'erent Fruits, and particularly I found Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance; and Grapes
upon the Trees; theVines had fpread indeed over
the Trees, and the Clui'ter's oF Grapes were jufl:
now in their Prime,very ripe and rich: This was a
furprifing Difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of
them 5 but i was warn'd by my Experience to eat
fparingly of them, remembring, that when l was
_a1hore in Barbary, the eating of Grapes kill'd feveral
of our Engi'iflr Men who were Slaves there, by
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I
found an excellent Ufe for the Grapes, and that
was to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep
them as dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which -
l thought would be, as indeed they were, as
wholefozne as agrceable to eat, when no Grapes
Could be had. ' ' _

I (pent all that Evening there, and went 'nOt
back to my Habitation, which by the way was
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lain from
Home. In the Night I took my firlt Contrivancc',
and got up into aTree, where l flept well, and the
next l'Aorning proceeded upon my Difcovery, tra-
velling near four Miles, as I might judge by thC
length of the Valley, keeping Ptill due North,with

a Ridge of Hills on the South, and Ball fide of
me. '

At the End of this March I came to an Open~

' ing, where the Country l'eem'd to defcend {KO "Bic
' ' I 'VC 3[I17 1

VVefl, and a little Spring of fi'cflr'y-Vater, which if;
fued our of the Side of the Hill by'me, run the
other way, that is due Ball 5 and the Country ap-
pear'd fo frefl], fo green, f0 flouriflring, everything
being in a 'eonf'tant Verdure, or Flourilh of Spring,
that it look'd like a planth Garden.

I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious
Vale, furveying it with a lizcret Kind, of Pleafure,
(tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of all this Country indefeafibly, and
had a Right of Pofl'eflions'and ifl could convey it,
Imight have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as
any Lord of a Manor in England. I faw here
Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Le-
mon, and Citron Trees; but all wild, and very
few bearing any Fruit, at leait not then : Howe-
ver the green 'Limes that I gathered, were not
only plealant to. eat, but very wholefome 5 and I
mix'd- their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholcfome, and very cool, and re-
frefhing. ' r

1 found now Iliad Bulinefs enough to gather and
carry Home; 'and I refolv'd to lay tip a Store, as
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh
myfelt'for the wet Seafon, which I knew was lap:
proaehing. V

In Order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of
Grapes in one Place,.and a lefcr Heap in another
Place, and a great Parcel ofLiines and Lemons in
another Place; and takinga few ofeaeh with me,
I travell'd homeward, and refolv'd to come again,
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make to
carry the rep: Home. . _

. Accordingly, having {pent three Days in this
Journey, I came Home 5 fo I mufl; now call my
' Ten: and my Cave: Bur before I got thither, the

I 3 Grapes
Grapes were fpoil'd, the Richnefs oF the Fruits3
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruis'd them, they were good for little or no,
thing; as to the Limes they were good, but I
could bring but a few.

The next Day, being the 19th, I went back,
having made me two {mall Bags to bring Home
my Harvefi; But I was furpriz'd, when coming
to my Heap of Grapes, which were {0 rich and
fine when I gather'd them, I Found them all fpread
about, trod to Pieces, and drag'd about, {ome
here, fome there, and Abundance eaten and dc,
vour'd : By this I concluded, there were fome wilq
Creatures thercabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not. '

However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away ii]
a Sack, but that one Way they would be dellroy'd,
and the other way they would be crufh'd with
their oWn Weight, I took another Courfe 5 for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun; and as for
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as many back as
I could well itand under. '

When I came Home from thisJourncy 3 I Icon-
templated with great Pleaiure the F ruitt'ulnels of
that Valley, and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,
and the Wood, and concluded, that I had pitch'd
upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far
the worfl: Part of the Country; Upon the whole
I began to confider of removing my Habitation 5
and to look out for a Place equally fate, as where
I now was fituatc, if poflible, in that pleaiant
fruitful Part of the Iflanu'. I i '

5 This
This Thought run long in my Head, and I was
exceeding fond of it For fomc Time, the Pleai'ano-
nefs of the Place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to confider that I was.
now by the Sea-Side, where it was at leafi poflible
that fornething might happen to my Advantage,
and by the fame ill Fate that brought me hither,
might bring {ome other unhappy VVretChcs to the
fame Place; and tho' it was {carce probable that
any fuch Thing ihould ever happen, yet to encloi'e
myfelf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
.of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
torcnder fuch an Affair not only improbable, but
impoflible; and that therefore I ought not by any
Means to remove.

However, I was {0 enamour'd of this Place,
that I {pent much of my Time there for the
whole remaining Part of the Month of 71:01; and
tho' uponlecond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not
to remove, yet I built me a little kind ot'a Bower,
and {urrounded it at a Diitancc with a {irong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well fiak'd, and fill'd between with BI'II/ZJ- _
wood 5 and here I lay very fecure, lorrietiines two
.or three Nights together, always going over it
With :1 Ladder, as before, {0 that It'ancy'd now I
had my Country Houle, and my Sea-Coali-Houl'e:
And jzhis Work tool; me up to the Beginning of
flugu . ' " '

I had but newly finifh'd my Fence, and began
to enjoy my Labour, when the Rains came on, and
made me iiiclt- cloi'e to my firli Habitation; for tho'
I had made me 3. Tent like the other, with a Piece
of a Sail, and fpread it very well ;. yet! had not
the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor
a Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains
were CXtraordinary.

About the beginning of dugufl, a: I fizz'd, I had
finifh'd my Bower, and began to enjoy myfelf.
The third of dugufl, I found the Grapes I had
hung up were perfeelly dry'd, and, indeed, were
excellent good Railins of the Sun; {'0 I began to
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that Idid {05 for the Rains which follow'd
would havefpoil'd them, and I had 101': the bell:
Part of my .VVinterFood; for I had above two
hundred-large Bunches of them. No fooner had
I 'taken. them all down, and carry'd molt of them
Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and From
hence, which was the fourteenth offlugufl, it rain'd
more or lefs, every Day, till the middle oi'Ofi'ober;
and fometimes {o violently, that Icould not i'tir out
of my Cave for feveral pays. '

Increafe of my Family 5 1 had been concern'd for
the Lois of one of my Cats, who run away From
me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Allonifh-
ment file came'I-Iome about the End of flirgufl,
with three Kittens. This was the more It angle to
me, becaufe tho' I had kill'd a wild _Cat, as I '
call'd it, with my Gun; yet I thought itwas a
quite dilfi-ring Kind From our Ew'cpean Cats 3 yet
the young Cats werethe fame Kind of Home. breed
like the old one; and both my Cats being Females,
I thought it very Ilrange: But from thefe three
Cats, l-al'terwa'rds came to be {0 pef'cer'd with CatS,
that lwas forc'd to kill them like Vermin, or wild
Beafis, and. to drive them from my Houfe as'much
as poflible; < '

was now very careful not to be much wet. In this
Confinementl began to be lli'aitned for Food, buF

' ' ' venturing
venturing out twice, I one Day ltill'd a Goat, and
the laf'c Day, which was the twenty fixth, found
a very large Tortoife, which was :1 Treat to me,
and my Food was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch of:
Railins for my Break fall, a Piece of the Goat's Flefh,
or of the Turtle For my Dinner broil'd; for to my
great Misfortune, I had no Vcll'el to boil or flew
[any Thing 3 and two or three .ol-'the Turtle's Eggs
{or my Supper.

During thisConfinement in my Cover by the Rain,
I work'd daily two or three Hours at enlarging my
Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on towards one Side,
till I Came to the Outfide of the Hill, and made
a Dooror \Vay out, which came beyond my Fence
or W all, and lo I came in and 0th this W ay; but I
was not perfectly only at lying {'0 open; for as I
had manag'd myfelf before, I was in a perfeet Enu
elofure, whereas now I thought I lay expos'd, and
open for any Thing to come in upon me; and yet
I could not perceive that there was any living
Thing to fear, the biggeil; Creature that I had yet:
{een upon the Ifland being a Goat.

September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniverlary of my Landing. I cait up the
Notehes on my Poll, and found [had been on
Shore three hundred and fixty five Days. I kept
this Day as a Solemn Fall, fetting it apart to Re-
ligious Exereile, proi'trating myl'elt' 0n the Ground
with the molt ferious Humiliation, confefling my
Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer-
.C)' on me, through jig/us Clan'fl; and having not
tailed the leaf: Refrefhment for twelve Hours,
even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat
a Bisket Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went

to Bed, finifhing the Day as! began it.

I had
I had all this Time obferv'd no Sabbath~DaySS
for as at firi't I had no Senl'e of Religion upon my
Mind, I had after fome Time omitted to dif'tin>>
guiih the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really
know what any of the Days were; but now having
cai't up the Days, as above, I found I had been
there a Year; (0 Idivided it into Weeks, and fet
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath; though I
found at the End of my Account I had loll: a Day
or two in my Reckoning.

A little after this my Ink began to Fail me, and
{o I contented myfelf to ufe it more {paringlya and
to write down only the mofl remarkable Events of
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum

of other Things. '

' The rainy Seafon, and the dry Seafon, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide
them To, as to provide for them accordingly. But
I bought all my ExPerience before I had it; and
thisI am going to relate, was one of the molt dile
couraging ExPeriments that Imade at all. I have
mention'd that I had fav'd the few Ears of Barley
and Rice, which I had [0 furprizingly found fpring
up, as I thought, of themlelves, and believe there
were about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twenty
of Barley; and now I thought it a proper Time
to {ow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its
Sow/rem Pofition going from me. _

Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well
as Icould with my wooden Spade, and dividing 1.13 '
into two Parts, I fow'd my Grain; but as I was
fowing, it cafually occur'd to my Thoughts, that
I would not fow- it all at firl't, becaufe I did not
know when was the proper Time for it; {o I fow'd
about two Thirds of the Seed, leaving about 2'
handful of each. ' " Iff 123 ]

It was agreat Comfort to me afterwards, that
I did fo, for not one Grain of that I fow'd this
Time came to any Thing; for the .dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after the
Seed was fown, it had no Moii'ture to afhll its
.Growth, and never came up at all, til" the wet
Seafon had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been but newly (own.

Finding my firl'c Seed did not grow, which I
eafily imagin'd was by the Drought, I fought For
a moil'ter Piece of Ground to make another Trial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and fow'd the reft of my Seed in February,
a little before the Vernal Equinox 5 and this having
the rainy Months of March and dprz'l to water it,
{prung up very pleafantly, and yielded a very good
Crop; but having Part of the Seed left only, and
not daring to {ow all that I had, I had but a {mall
.Qiantity at lalt, my whole Crop not amounting
to abOVe half a Peck of each kind,

But by this Experiment I was made Mailer of
my Bufinefs, and lgncw exactly when the pmper
Seafon was to row; and that I might expect two
Seed Times, and Wm Harvells every Year. .

,While this Corn was grOWing, I made a little
Difcovcry which was of Ufe to me afterwards; As
{0011 as the Rains were over, and the Weather be-
gan t0 fettle, Which was about the Month of N -
'vember, I made a Vifit up the Country to my Bow.
er, Where though _I had not been forne Months, yet
I found all Things juil as I left them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly firm and entire 3 but the Stakes which I had cut
out Of fome Trees that grew thereab'outs, were all
ihoc out and groan With long Branches, as much
as a Willow-'l'ree Ufually {hoots the firlt Year after
lopping its Head, I could not tell what Tree to

' call
cali it, that thefe Stakes were cut from. I was
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to fee the
young Trees grow; and Iprun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could; and it
is fcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew
into in three Years; {0 that though the Hedge
made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Dia-
meter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might now call
them, foon cover'd it; and it was a compleat
Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the dry Seafon.

This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall; I mean that of my firfi Dwel-
ling, which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes
in a double Row, at about eight Yards d-i-il'ance
from my firl'c Fence, they grew prefentiy, and
-were at firfl a fine Cover to my Habitation, and
afterward ferv'd for a Defence alfo, as I {hall ob-
ferve in its Order.

I found now, That the Seafons of the Year
might generally be divided, not into Summer and
Wimfer, as in Europe, but into the Rainy Seafons,
and the Dry Seafons, which were generally thus:

Half Feifgag'ZRainy, the Sun being then on, or

. jar/21m",
Half Februaryb

The Rainy Seafon fometimes held longer or
fliorter, as the Winds happcn'd to blow; but this
was the general Obfervation I made: After I had
found, b'y'Experience, the ill Confequence of being
abr'qitd'in the Rain, I took care to furnifh myfelf
witli'fProvifions beforehand, that I might not. be
oblig'tl to go out; and I fat within Doors as much
as poflible during the wet Months.

In this Time I found much Employment, (and
very fuitablealfo to the Time) for I found great:
Occafion of many Things which I had no way to
furniih myfclf Wltll, but by hard Labour and con-
i'tant Application; particularly, I try'd many 'Ways
to make myfclf a Basket, but all the Twigs I
could get for the Fur-pole prov'd f0 brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Ad-
vantage to me now, That when I wasa Boy, I
ufed to take great Delight in itanding at a Basket-
maker's in the Town where my Father liv'd, to
fee them make their Mekewware; and being, as
Boys ul'ually are, very officious to help, and a,
great Obl'erver of the Manner how they work'd
thole Things, and iometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this Means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I Wanted nething but the Materials;
when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I CUt my Stakes that grew,

5 might:
might poflibly be as tough as the 84110105, and:
Willows, and Ofier: in Englmzrl, and I refolv'd
to try.

Accordingly the next Day I went to" my Coun-
try~rT.-ioufe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the
{mallet Twigs, I Found them to my Pui'pofe as
much as I could defire; whereupon I came the next
Time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a'
Qlantity, which I foon found, for there was great
Plenty of them; thefe I fet up to dry within my
Circle-jar Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe,
I carried them to my Cave, and here during the
next Seafon I employ'd my {elf in making, as well
as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth, or to carry or lay up any Thing as Ihad'
occafion. And tho' I did not finifh them very hand-'
fomly, yet I made them fufl-iciently ferviceable For
my Purpofe; and thus afterwards I took Care ne-
ver to be without them 3 and as my Maker-ware
decay'd, Imade more, efpecially, I made firong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, initead of Sacks,
when I {hould come to have any @antity of it.

Having 'mafier'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a-
World of Time about it, I beiiir'd myfelf to fee
if poflible how to fupply two Wants: I had no
Vefl'els to hold any Thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almofl: full of Rum,-
and fome Glafs Bottles, fome of the common Size,
and others which were CafeoBottles fquare, for
the holding of Waters, Spirits, 69%. I had not fo-
much as a Pot to boil any Thing, except a great
Kettle, which I fav'd out of the Ship, andwhich
was too big for fuch Ufe as I defir'd it, viz. to
make Broth, and flew a Bit of Meat by it (elf.
The Second Thing I would fain have had, was a

Tobaccchipeg but it was impofiible to me Ito
ma if)
make one, however I found a Contrivance for that
too at lafir.

I employ'd myfelF in Planting my Second Rows
of Stakes or Piles, and in this Maker-working all the
Summer, or dry Seafon, when another Bufinels
took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd
I could fpare.

I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to
fee the whole lfland, and that I ohad travell'd up
the Brook, and {0 on to where Idegbuilt my Bower,
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Ifland. I now refolv'd to
travel quite crofs to the Sea-Shore on that Side ;
[0 taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog, and
a larger Qiantity of Powder and Shot than ufual,
with two Bisket Cakes, and a great Bunch of
Raifins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my
Journey. When I had pafs'd the Vale where my
Bower flood as above, I came within View of the
Sea, to the Wit/land it being a very clear Day, I fairly
defcry'd Land, whether an Ifland or a Continent, I
could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the "47% to the W. S. }V. at a very great Diitance;
by my Guefs it could nor be leis than Fifteen or
Twenty Leagues oil".

I could not tell what Part of the World this
might be, otherwife than that I knew it mull: be
part of dmerz'm, and as I concluded by all my
Obfervations, mull be near the Spam/b Dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by Savages, where
if I ihould have landed, I had been in a worl'e
Condition than I was now 3 and therefore I acqui-
elced in the Difpofitions of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, order'd every
Thing for the beflt 3 I fay, I quieted my Mind with
this, and left afllieting myfelf with fruitlefs Wifhes

of being there.
Befides
Befides, after fome Paufe upon this Affair, i
confider'd, that if this Land was the Spam ,9 Coaft,
I fhould certainly, one Time or other, fee fome
Vefiel pals or re-pafs one Way or other 5 but it"
not, then it was the Savage Coalt between the
Spam/19 Country and Bmfl/s, which are indeed the
Worfi of Savage: 5 for they are Cannibals, or Men-
eaters, and fail not to murther and devour all the
humane Bodies that fall into their Hands.

With thefe Cbnfiderations I walk'd very leil'ure-
1y forward. 1 found that Side of the Iii-and where
- I now was, much pleaiiinter than mine, the open
or Savant; Fields (weer, adorn'd with Flowers and
Grafs, and full of very fine Woods. Ifaw Abun-
dance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one,
if poflible to have kept. it to be tame, and taught
it to {peak to me. I did, after fome Pains taking,
catch a young Parrot, for I ltnock'd it down with
a Sticl<,and having recover'd it, I brought it home;
but it was {om-e Years before I could make him
fpealt: However, at hill I taught him to call me
by my Name very familiarly: Btit the Accident
that follow'd, tho' it be aTriHe, will be very di-
verting in its Place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low Grounds Hares, as I thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they difl'er'd greatly
from all the other Kinds 1 had met with 5 nor could
I fatisfy mylEIF to eat them, tho' I kill'd feveral:
But I had no need to be venturous; for i had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too; ei'pecially thefe three Sorts, viz. Goats, Pid~
geons,ann Turtle or Tortoife; which, added to iny
Grapes, .Leadm-lmll Market could not have rur~
nifh'd a 'i able better than I, in Proportion to the
Company, and tho' my Cafe was deplorable

enough, yet I had great Caufe for Thaiiicfnliiflgse4 - <<1'- fr. not 2:.W3'26W

[129]

that I was not driven to any EXtremities for Food 3
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties. _

I never travell'd in this Journey above two Miles
outright in a Day, or thereabouts; but I took Io
many Turns and Returns, to (CC what Dii'coveries
I could make, that I came weary enough to the
Place where I refolved to fit down for all Night 3
and then Ieither repos'd myfelf in a Tree, or lur-
rounded myfelf with a Row of Stakes let upright
in the Ground, either from one Tree to another,
or (0 as no wild Creature could come at me, with>>
out waking me.

As foon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was fur-
prized to fee thatl had taken up my Lot on the
worf't tide of the Ifland; for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas on
the other {ide I had found bur three in a Year and
half. Here was alro an infinite number of Fowls,
of many Kinds, fome which I had fecn, and forne
which I had not feen 0F before, and many of them
very good Meat; bur fizch as l knew not the
Names of, except thofc call'd Penguins.

1 could have {hot as many as l pleas'd, bUt was
very {paring oi'my Powder and Shot 5 and therefore
had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I Could,
which I could better feed on; and though there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
lfland, yet it was with much more Difiiculty that
1 could come near them, the Country being flag
and even, and they law me much Fooner than when
l was on the Hill.

I confers this Side of the Country was much
pleaf'anter than mine, bUt yet I had not the leafl: In-
clination to remove; for as I was fix'd in my Ha:
bltation, it became natural to me, and I i'eem'd all
the while I was here, to be as it were upon 21 [our-
My; and from Home: However, Itravcll'd along

5 thG*l 130]

the Shore of the Sea, towards the Eafl, I fuppofe
about twelve Miles; and then fetting up a great
Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I

would go home again; and that the next Journey
I took ihould be on the other Side of the Ifland,
Eczfi from my Dwelling, and {0 round till I came
to my Poll: again : Of which in its Place.

I took another Way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could eafily keep all the Ifland to
much in my View, that I could not mil's finding
my firfi'Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I
found my felf millaken; for being come about two
or three Miles, I found my {elf defcended into a
very large Valley; but Fo fur-rounded with Hills,
and thofe Hills covered with Wood, that I could
not fee which was my Way by any Direetion bLIt
that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefslknew very-
gell the Pofition of the Sun at that Time of the

ay.

It happened to my farther Misfortune, That the
Weather prov'cl hazey for three or four Days,
while I was in this V alley; and not being able to
fee the Sun, Iwander'd about very uncomfortably,
and at hit was obliged to find out the Sea Side,
look for my Poll, and come back the fame Way I
went 3 and then by eafy Journeys l turn'd Home-
ward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my
Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things
very heavy. .

. In this Journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid,
and feiz'd upon it, and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and {av'd it alive from the Dog:
I had a great mind to bring it home if I could;
forI had often been mufing, Whether it mightnOt
be poflible to get a Kid or two, and f0 raife a Breed
of tame Goats, which might fupply me when my
Powder and Shot fl'lOUlCl be all (pent. I$4.331, -. " ' '--

I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with
aSti-ing which 1 madeof fomeRope- 'arn, which
I always carry'd about me, I led him along, tho'
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and _
there I enclos'd him, and left him 3 for 1 was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
ablent above a Month.

I cannoc exPrefs what a Satisfaetion it was to
me, to come into my old Hutch, and lye down in
my Hamock-Bed: This little wandring Journey,
without fettled Place of Abode, had been {0 un-
plealant to me, that my own Honk, as I call'd it
to my (elf, was a perfeel: Settlement to me, com-
par'd to that; and it render'd every thing about
me {o comfortable, that I refolv'd 1 would never
go a great way from it again, while it fhould be

- my Lot to liay on the lfland.

I repos'd my {elf hercaWeek, to rel} and regale

my {elf after my longJourney 5 during which, molt
ol'the Time was taken up in the weighty Allair of
making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a mere Domeflick, and to be mighty well acquain-
ted with me. Then Ibegan to think of the poor
Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Cir-
cle, and relblv'd to go and fetch it home, or give
it lome Food 5 accordingly I went, and found it
where I left it; for indeed it could not get: out, but
was almoli flax-v'd for want of Food. I wentand
cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of fuch Shrubs
as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed
it, I ty'd it as I did before to lead it away; but it
Was fo tame with being hungry, that I had no need
to have ty'd it 3 for it follow'd me like a Dog, and
as I continually fed it, the Creature became fo
loving, f0 gentle, and f0 fond, that it was from
that Time one of my Domelticlts alfo, and Would
flcver leave me afterwards.

K .1 The
The rainy Seafon of the flutzmmal Egm'nox was
now come, and Ikept the 30th of September in the
fame lolemn manner as before, being the Anniveru
fary 0F my Landing on the Ifland, having now been
there two Years, and no more Profpee'c of being de-
livered than the firfl' Day I came there. I incur the
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my Sou
litary Condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miferable.
1 gave humble and hearty Thanks that'God had
been pleafed to dil'covcr to me, even that it was
pofiible I might be more happy in this Solitary
Condition, than l ihould have been in :1 Liberty of
Society, and in allthePleafures of the World. That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of
my Solitary State, and the want of Humane So-
ciety, by his Prefence, and the Communications of
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence
here, and hope For his eternal Prel'ence hereafter.

It was now that I began feniibly to feel how
much more happy this Life I now led was, with
all its mil'crable Ci-rcumltances, than the wicked,
curfed, abominable Life I led all the pa"; Part of
my Days; and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my joys; my very Defires alter'd, my Aficeeth
ons changed their Crafts, and my Delights were
perfee'tly new, from what thevaere at my firfl:
Coming, or indeed for the two Years pail.

Before, as I walk'd about either on my Hunt~
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguifb Of
my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon
me on a fudden, and my very Heart would _d1e
within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains,
the Defarts I was in; and how I was a Prifoner
lock'd up with the eternal Bars and Bolts of the

. 5 . Ocean,
Ocean, in an uninhabited VVildei-nci's, without Re<<
demption : In the midil Ol'tl1(?gi'8:lt('ll':.:0213570llll'68
of my Mind, this would break out unon me like a
Storm, and make me wring my Hinds, and weep
like a Child: Sometimes it would take me 'in the
middle 0me Work, and I would immediately fit
down and ligh, and look upon the Gretind For an
Hour or two together 5 and this was llill worfe to
me 3 For iFI could burll out into Tears, or vent
my {elf by Words, it would go OFF, and the Grief
having exhaull'cd it: felt, would abate.

But now I began to excreil'e my fielF with new
Thoughts; Idaily read the Word of God, and ap-
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prelEnt State.
One Morning being very (ad, I Opt-n'd the Bible
upon theie W ords, 1 will mater, never leave 7/960,
aorfbrfa/cc 11706; immediately it occurr'd, That there
W'ords were to me, Why ell'c {hould they be direct-
ed in fuch a Manner, jull; at the Moment when I
was mourning over my Condition, as one forfaken
of God and Man? Well then, laid I, iFGod does
not Fan-fake me, of what ill Coniequence can it be,
or what matters it, though'the \Vorld {hould all
forfake me, feeing on the other hand, ifI had all
the \Vorld, and Ihould lofe the Favour and Biof-
iing of God, there would be no Compai'ifon in
the Lois ? '

From this Moment I beban to conclude in my
Mind, That lit'was pollible for me to be more
happy in this Forlaken Solitary Condition, than it
Was probable I fliould ever have been in any Other
particular State in the World 5 and with this
T bought I was going to give Thanks to God for
bringing me to this Place.

I know not what it was, but fomething ihock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and I duri't not {peak
the Words : How Canlt thou be fuch a Hypocrite,

' K 3 (faid
(faid I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for
9. Condition, which however thou may'f'c endea.
vour to be contented with , thou would'fl rather
pray heartily to be deliver'd from -, f0 I finpp'd
there: But though I could not lay, I thank'd God
for being there; yet I fincerely gave Thanks to
God for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting
Providences, to fee the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my VVickednefs, and repent.
I never open'd the Bible, or [but it, but my very
Soulwithin ine blels'd God for direeting my Friend
in England, without any Order of mine, to pack it
Up among my Goods 5 and for aflifiing me after-
wards to fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began
my third Year ; and tho' I have not given the Rea-
der the Trouble of fo particular Account of my
Works this Year as the firf't; yet in general it
may be obferv'd, That I was very feldom idle;
but having regularly divided my Time, according
to the feveral daily Employments that were before
me, fuch as, Fir/2", my Duty to God, and the Read-
ing the Scriptures, which I coni'tantly fet apart
{omeTime for thrice every Day. Second/3', The go-
ing abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when
it did not rain. Tbirdly, The ordering, curing,
preferving, and cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd
for my Supply; thefe took up great Part of the '
Day: Alfo it is to be confidered that the middle of
the Day, when the Sun was in the Zem'tla, the V io-
lence of the Heat was too great to fiir out 5 fo that
about four Hours in the Evening was all the Time
I could be fuppos'd to work in, with this Excep-
tion, That fometimes I chang'd my Hours of

Hunting and \Vorking, and went to work in the
h'iormngMorning, and abroad with my Gun in the After-

noon.
To this fhort Time allow'd for Labour, I defire

may be added the exceeding Laborioufnefs of my
Work 3 the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill; every Thing I
did, took up out of my Time. For example, I
was full two and forty Days making me a Board for
a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave ; where-
as two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit,
would have cut fix of them out of the fame Tree
in halfa Day.

My Cafe was this: It was to be a large Tree,
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was
to he a broad one. This Tree I was three Days
a entting down, and two more cutting off the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log or Piece of Tim--
ber. With inexpreflible hacking and hewing I
reduc'd both the Sides of it into Chips, till it be-
gun to be light enough to move; then I turn'd it,
and made one Side of it fmooth and flat as a
Board, from End to End; then turning that fide
downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and finooth
on both Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of
my Hands in fuch a piece of 'Work 5 but Labour
and Patience carry'd me through that and many
Other things : I only obferve this in particular, to
fliew the Re'afon why fo much of my Time went
away with lb little Work, 'vz'z. That what might be
a little to be done With Help and Tools, was a vali:
Labour, and requirfd aprodigious Time to do alone,

and by hand. . .
But notwithfiandmg this, With Patience and Let--

hour I went through many things; and indeed eve,
ry thing that my Circumi'cances made neceflary to
me to do, as will appear by What follows. '

' ' .K 4- I was
I was now, in the Months of November and De.
cemeer, e'Xpee'ting my Crop of Barley and Rice,
The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them
Was not great 5 For 2131 obferv'd, my Seed of each
was Mr above the Quantity of half a Peck 3
for I, had loft one whole Crop by {owing in the
dry Seafon 5 but now my Crop promis'd very well,
when on a fudden I found I was in danger of lo-
iing it all again by Enemies of fever-a1 Sorts, which
It was {carce poflible to keep from it; as Firfl, the
Coats, and wild Creatures which I call'd Hares,
who tailing the Sweetncfs of the Blade, lay in it
'Night and Day, as foon as it came up, and eat it
gocllofe, that it could get no Time to {hoot up into

ta k.

This I law no Remedy For, but by making an En--
'clofure about it with a Hedge, which I did with a
great deal of T oil; and the more ,' becaufe it re-
quir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land was
but final], fuited to my Crop, I got it totally well
fenc'd, in about three 'Weeks Time; and {hooting'
fome of the Creatures in the Day-time, I fet my
Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a
Stake at the Gate, where he would iland and bark
all Night long; (0 in a little time the Enemies for:
fook the Place, and the Corn grew very i'trong, and
Well, and began to ripenapace.

But as the Beafls ruined me before, while my
Corn was in the Blade 5 fo the Birds were as likely
to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear; for go-
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, I law
my little Crop fur-rounded with Fowls of I know
not how many forts, who flood as it were watch.
ing till Iihould be gone: I immediately let fly 3:-
mong them (For I always had my Gun with me)
I had no fooner {hot but there role up a little

CloudCloud of Fowls, which Ihad not feen at all, From
among the Corn it felf.

This tuUCl'l'd me l'enlibly, for I Forelaw, that in
a few Days they would devour all my Hopes, that I
fllould be ltarv'd, and never be able to mile :1 Crop
at all, and what to do 1 could not tell : However,
I yel'olv'd not to lole my Corn, if poflible, tho'I
flmuld watch it Night and Day. In the firth
Place, I went among it to fee what Damage was
already done, and found they had fpoil'd agood
deal of it, but that as it was yet too green for
them, the Lols was not lb great, but that theRe<<
mainder was like to be a good Crop if it could be
fav'd.

I {laid by it to load .my Gun, and then coming
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all
the 'I'rces about me, as if they Ollly waited till I
was gone away, and the Event proved it to be {0 5
for as I walk'd ofl: as if I was gone, I was no fooner
out of their Syght, but they dropt down one by
one into the Corn again. I was lb provok'd thatI
could not have Paria'nce to (lay till more came on,
knowing that every Grain that they eat now, was,
as it wig/at Ive/aid, :1 Peak loaf to me in the Confe-
qucnce; but coming up to the Hedge, I fir'd again,
and kill'd three of them. This was what I wilh'd
for 5 {o I took them up, and l'erv'd them as we
ferve notorious Thicvcs in England ('vz'z.) hang'd
them in Chains for aTerror to Others. It is im-
pollible to imagine almoll, that this fhould have fuch
an Eflfca- as it had, for the Fowls wou'd not only
net come at the Corn, but in {hort they fox-fool; all
that Part of the Illand, and I could never feeaBird
near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung
there.

Thisl138] ,

This I was very glad of, you may be fure, and a-
bout the latter end of December, which was our fe-
cond Harvefi of the Year, I reap'd my Crop.

' I was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broad Swords
or Cutlafi'es, which I fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However, as my firit Crop was but (mall,
I. had no great Difficulty to cut it down; in fhort,
I reap'd it my way, for I Cut nothing off but the
Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made,- and {o rnbb'd it out with my Hands;
and at the End of all my I-Iarvefiing, I found that
out of my half Peck of Seed, I had near two Buthels
of Rice, and abovc two Buihels and half 0? Barley,
z'lmz' 2'5 i0 [2% by my Guels, for I had no Meafure
at that time. .

However, this was a great Encouragement to me ;
and I forefaw that in time, it would pleafe God
to fupply me with Bread : And yet here I was per~
plex'd again, forI neither knew how to grind or
' make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it
and part it. 3 nor if made into Meal, how to make
Bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I knew
not how to bake it : thefe things being added to my
Defire of having a good (Luantity of Store, and to
fecure a confiant Supply, Irefolv'd not to ta'fie any
of this Crop, but to preferve it all for Seed againlt
the next Seafon, and in the mean time to employ
all my Study: and Hours of Working to accompliih
this great Work of Providing my felf with Corn
and Bread.

It might be truly faid, that now I work'd For
my Bread : 'tis a little wonderful, and what I be-
lieve Few People have thought much upon, (72in the

tirange multitude of little Things neceflary in the
Pro:-
Providing, Producing, Curing, Dreiling, Making
and F inifhing this one Article of Bread.

I that was reduced to a mere State of Nature,
found this to my daily Difcouragement, and was
made more and more fenfible oFit every Hour, even
after I had got the firfl Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have (aid, came up unexpeetedly, and
indeed to a fiirprize.

F iri'c, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquer'd,
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before;
but this did my Work but in a wooden manner, and
tho' it cof'c me a great many Days to make it, yct
for want of Iron it not only wore out the fooner,
but made my 'vVork the harder, and made it be per-
form'd much work.

However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it om with Patience, and bear with the bad-
nefs of the Performance. When the Corn was fow'd,
I had no Harrow, but was Forced to go over it my
felF, and drag a great heavy Bough ofa Tree over
it, to Scratch it, as it may be call'd, rather than
Rake or Harrow it.

When it was growing and grown, I have 0b..
ferv'd already, how many Things I wanted, to
Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure and
Carry it home, Thrafh, Part it from the Chaff',
and Save it. .T hen I wanted a Mill to Grind it,
Sieves to Drefs it, Yeafi: and Salt to make it into
Bread, and an Oven to bake it 5 and yet all thefe
things I did without, as'fhall be obferv'd 5 and
yet the Corn was an incitimable Comfort and Ad-
vantage to me too' <<All this, as I faid, made
every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that

there was no help for, neither was my Time fo
much Lois to me, becaufe as I had divided it, a
certain Part of it was every Day appointed to
thefe
thefe Works; and as I refolv'd to ufe none of the
Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by
me, I had the next fix Months to apply my felf
wholly by Labour and Invention to fur-nilh my
felf with Ut'enfils proper for the performing all the
Operations necefl'ary for the making the Corn
(when I hadit) fit for my ufe.

But firlt, I was to prepare more Land, for I,
had now Seed enough to fow abovean Acre of
Ground. Before I did this, I had a Weeks-work
at leaft to make me a Spade, which when it was
done was but a forty one indeed, and very heavy,
and rcquir'd double Labour to work with it;
however I went thro' that, and fow'd my Seed In
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my
Houfe as I could find them to my Mind, and
fenc'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had {ct
before, and knew it would grow, fo that in one
Year's time I knewI fllould have a (luck or LiY'
ing~Hedge, that would want but little Repair;
This Work was not f0 little as to take me Up leis
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that
time was of the wet Seafon, when I could not go
abroad.

_ Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I
could not go out, I found Employment on the tol-
lowing Occalions; always ohferving, that all the
while I was at work I diverted my {elf with talk-
ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to {peaks
and Iquickly learn'd him to know his own Name,
and at lafl: to fpeak it out pretty loud, P OLL:
which was the firl't Word I ever heard fpokcn 1.11 =
the'Ifland by any Mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my Work, but an aflil'tant to my
VVoi-k; for now, as Ifaid, I had a great EmplOY'

ment upon my Hands, as follows, (we) 111121:
0])
long f'tudy'd, by fome Means or other, to make
my {elf fome Earthen Vefl't'ls, which indeed I
Wanted i'orely, but knew not where to come at
them: However, confidering the Heat of'thc Cli~
mate, I did nOt doubt but ifI could find out any
fuch Clay, I might botch up fume fuch Pot, as
might, being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough,
and l'trong enough to bear handling, and to hold
any Thing that was dry, and requir'd to be kept
{as and as this was neccflary in the preparing
Corn, Meal, {9%. which was the Thing I was up-
on, I refiilv'd to make fome as large as I could,
and fit only to fiand like jarrs' to hold what fhould
be put into them.

It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many awkward Ways I
took to raife this Paile, what odd mifhapen ugly
things I made, how many of them fellin, and how
many fell our, the Clay not being flifl' enough to
bear its own 'Weight; how many crack'd by the
over violent Heat of the Sun, being (CI; 0th too
hallily; and how'manyf'cil in pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dry'd;
and in a word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home and work it 5 I could not make above two
large earthen uglythings, I cannot call themJai-rs,
in about two Months Labour.

However, as the Sun bak'd thefe two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and {en
them down again in two great VVickeinaskets,
which 1 had made 011 purpOfe for them, that they .
might not break, and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was alittle room to fpare, l fluff'd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two
Pets being to ilaud always dry, I thought would i

hold
hold in 'dr' Corn and cr'ha s the Meal
the Corh W21; bruiiged. ' P P , When

Tho' I mifcarried {'0 much in my Defign Fm.
large Pots, yet'I made feveral fmallcr things with
better Succefs; fuch as little round Pets, flat DifheS
Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand,
turn'd to, and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them
firangely hard.

But all this would not anl'wer my End, which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li-
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thefe could
do. It happen'd after fome time, making a pretty
large Fire for cooking my Meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware VeiTels in the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile,
I was agreeably furpriz'd to fee it, and {aid to my
felF, that certainly they might be made to burn
Whole, if they would burn broken.

' This fet me to f'tudying how to order my
Fire, {0 as to make it burn me fome Pots. I had
. no notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn
in, or of glazing them with Lead, tho' I had fomc
Lead to do it with 5 but I plac'd three large Pip-
kins, and two orthree Pots in a Pile one upon ano-- '
ther, and plac'd my Fire-wood all round it, with
a great Heap of Embers under them 5 I ply'd the
F he with frefh Fuel round the out-fide, and upon
the top, till I {aw the Pots in the infide red hot;
quite thro', and obferv'd that they did nor crack
at all 3 when I {aw them clear red, I let them itand
in that Heat about f or 6 Hours, till I found one
of them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run 5 for
. the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted
bv the violence of the Heat, and'would have run
into Glafsif I had gone on; {o I flack'd my Fire

gradually, till the Pots began to abate of the red
- Colour
Colour, and watching them all N ight,that Imight
not let the Fire abate too Fall; in the Morning I
had three very good, I will not lily handfome Pip-
kins; and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt:
-as cou'd be defir'd; and one of them perfectly
glaz'd with the running of the Sand.

After this Experiment, I need not Fay that I
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my Ule; but
I mufl: needs fay, as to the Shapes ol'them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may fuppofe,
when I had no way of making them; but as the
Children make Dirt-Pies, or as a Woman would
makes Pics that never learn'd to wife Paite.

No Joy at a Thing of ['0 mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I hadmade an
Earthen Pot that would hear the Fire; and I had
hardly Patience to flay till they were cold, before
I fet one upon the Fire again, with fom'e Water in
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did admirably
well; and with a piece of a Kid I made form: very
good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and feve-
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it [0 good
as I would have had it been.

My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to liamp or beat fome Corn in; for as to the
Mill,there was no thought at arriving to that Per-
f'cetion of Art, with one pair of Hands. To fuP-
ply this Want I was at a great Lois; for of all
Trades in the 'World I was as perfeetly unqualified
for a Stone-Cutter, as for any whatever; neither
had I any Tools to go about it with. I {pent many
a Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could
find none at all, except what was in the folid Rock,
and which I had no way to dig or cat out; nor in-
deed were the Rocks in the lfland of Hardnefs luf-
ficient, but were all of a fandy crumbling Stone,

which
3
which neither would hear the Weight of a heavy
Pcflle, 'or would break the Corn without filling it
with Sand 5 {0 after a great deal of Time loit in
fearching for a Stone, I gave it over, and refolv'd
to look out for a great Block of hard Wood, which
I found indeed much ealicr; and getting one as big
as I had Strength to fiir, I rounded it, and form'd
it in the Outfide with my Axe and Hatchet, and
then with the Help of Fire, and infinite Labour,
made a hollow Place in it, as the Indian: in Bmfil
make their Comm. After this, I made a great hea-
vy Pefile or Beater, of the Wood called the Iron-
Wood, and this I prepared and laid by againfl I had
my next Crop of' Com, when I propos'd to my (elf
to grind, or rather pound my Corn into Meal to
make my Bread.

My neXt Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or
Searfe, to drefs my Meal, and to part it from the
Bran and the Husk, without which I did not fee
it poflible I could have any Bread. This was a
moit difficult thing, fo much as but to think on;
for to be fare I had nothing like the neceflary
Thing to make it; Imean fine thin Canvas, or
Stuff to fearle the Meal through. And here I
was at a full Step for many Months; nor did l real-
ly know What to do; Linen 1 had none left, but
What Was meer Rags; I had Goat's Hair, but nei-
ther knew I how to weave it, or fpin it; and hadI
known how, here were no Tools to work it with;
all the Remedy that I found for this, was, That at
131': I did remember I had among the Seamens
Cloaths which were fav'd out of the Ship, forne
Neckcloaths of Callicoc or Muflin; and with forne
Pieces of thefe I made three fmall Sieves, but pro-
per enough for the Work 5 and thus I made ihift
for fome Years; how I did afterwards, I {hall
thew in its Place.

Thel I 45

The baking Part was the next Thing to be
confider'd, and how I fhould make Bread when I
came to have Corn 3 For fir!" had no Yeafltg as to
that Part, as there was no fupplying the Want, {'0 I
did not concern my {elf much aboutit: But for an
Oven, I was indeed in great Pain 5 at length Ifound
out an Experiment for that alfo, which was this 5
I made fome earthen Vefl'els very broad, but not.
deep; that is to fay, about two Foot Diameter,
and not above nine Inches deep 5 thefe I burnt in
the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by 3 and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
Fire upon my Hearth, which] had pav'd with fame
fquare Tiles of my own making, and burning alfo 5
but I fliould not call them fquare.

When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much in-
to Embers, or live Coals, I drew them forward
upon this Hearth, fo as to cover it all over, and there
I let them lie, till the Hearth was very hot; then
{weeping away all the Embers, I fet down my Loaf,
or Loaves, and whelming down the earthen Pot
upon them, drew the Embers all round the Out-fide
of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the Heat; and
thus, as well as in the belt Ovien in the World, I
bak'd my Barley Loaves, and beCame in little Time
a meet Paliry-Cook into the Bargain 3 for I made
my {elf feveral Cakes of the Rice, and Puddings 5
indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any T hing to
put into them, fuppofing I had, except the Flefh
either F owls or Goats.

It need not be wonder'd at, if all thel'e Things
took me up mofl: Part of the third Year of my A-
bode here ; for it is to be obferv'd, That in the In>>
tervals of thefe Things, [had my new Harvef'rand ,
Husbandry to manage -, for l reap'd my Corn in its
Seafon, and carried it Home as well as I could, and
laid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till i had
L ' Time:-
Time to rub it out; for-I had no Floor to thraih it
on, or Infirument to thraihit with.

And now indeed my Stock of Corn increafing,
Ireally wanted to build my Barns bigger : I wanted
a Place tolayit up in; for the Increale of the Corn
now yielded me {0 much, that lhad of the Barley
about twenty Bufhels, and of the Rice as much,
or more 5 infomuch, that now I refolv'd to begin
to ufe it freely; For my Bread had been quite gone
a great while; alfo I refolv'd to fee what Chianti-
ty would be {'uflicicnt for me a whole Year, and to
few In": oncea Year.

Upon the whole, I Found that the forty Bulhels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
confume in a Year; fo I refolv'd to fow juft the
fame (luautity every Year that Ifowed the lal'c, in
hopes that fueh a Quantity would fully provide me
with Bread, (9'6.

All the while thel'e Things \vere doing, you may
be Cure my Thoughts run many times upon the
Prol'peet of Land which I had feen from the Other
Side of the llland, and I was not without fecret
'Wifhes that l were on Shore there, fancying the
feeing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country.
I might find fome Way or ether to convey my
{elf farther, and perhaps at lall find forne Means
(5F 'Eibape.

But all this while I made no Allowance for the
Dangers of {itch a Condition, and how I might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I
might have Reafon totl'link far won-{e than the Li-
onsand'i'igers of x/frim. Thatif Ionce camein~
to their i'owcr, lihould run :1 Hazard more than a
'I'houl'and to One of being kill'd, and perhaps ofbe--~
ing eaten 5 for I had heard that the People of the
Cnrribemz Coal'ts were Cannibals or Man-eaters; and
I knew by the Latitude, that I could not be far of?
. 2, ' from
from that Shore. That fuppofe they were not Cania
bals, yet that they'might kill me, as many Em-opmm
who had fallen into :their Hands had been ferv'cl,
even when they had been ten or twenty together 5'
much more] that was butone, and could make lit-
tle or no Defence. All thefe Things, Ifiiy, which I
ought to have confider'd well of, and did cafl upin
my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my
Apprehenfions at firlt; but my Head run mightily
upon the Thought 0F getting over to the Shore.

N owI wifh'd For my Boy Xzzzy, and the Long-
Boat, with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with-
which I fail'd abovea thoufand Miles onthe Coafl:
of Africk ; but this was in vain. Then I thought I-'
would go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I
have faid, was blown up upon the Shore a great
Way in the Storm, when we were firl't caft away.
She lay almoft where {he did at firft, but not quite 5
and was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and the
'vVinds, almolf Bottom upward, againf't a high
Ridge of Beachy rough Sand; but no Water a-
bout her as before.

If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to
have launeh'd her into the Water, the Boat would
have done well enough, and 1 might have gone
back into the Braflls with her eafily enough 5 but
I might have Fox-elEen, that I could no more turn
her, and for her upright upon her Bottom, than I
could remove the lfland: However, I went to the
Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought
them to the Boat, reiblv'd to try what [could PS2) 9
{uggefting to my (611', that if 1 could but turn her
down, I might eafily repair the Damage ihe had
receiv'd, and {he Would be a very good Boat, and
l. might go to Sea in her very eafily.

1'. i'par'd no Painsindeed, in this Piece of fruislcfs
"Foil", and (pent, 1 think, three or four 'Weeks :1--

L 2- bout
bout it; at lai't finding it impoflible to heave it up *-
with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the
Sand to undermine it, and fo to make it fall down,
fettmg Pieces of Wood to thrul't and guide it right
in the Fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to {tir it
up again, or to get under it, mueh leis to move it
forward towards the Water 3 {o I was forc'd to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my defire to venture over For the Main
increafed, rather than decr'e21fed, as the Means for
it feem'd impoflible.

This at length put me upon thinking, Whether
it was not pofhble to make my {elf a Canoe, or Perin-
gua, fuch as the Natives ol'thol'e Climates make,even
without Tools, or, 2131 might fay, without Hands,
viz. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not
only thought pofiible, but eafy, and pleas'd my {elf
extreamly with the Thoughts of making it, and
with my having much more Convenience for it than
any of the Negroes or Indians 5 but not at all confi-
dering the particular Inconveniences which I lay
under, more than the Indians did, w'z. Vl'ant of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the
'Water; a Difficulty much harder for me to fur-
mount, than all the Confequences of want of
Tools could be to them : For what was it to me,
That whenI had ehofena vail Tree in the Woods,
I might with much Trouble cut it down, if alter
I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub
the Out-fideinto the proper Shape of a Boat, and
burn or cut out the Infide to make it hollow, {o

' to make a Boat of it, if after all this, I mutt leave
itjult there wherel found it, and was not able to
launch it into the Water.

One would have thought I could not have had
thelealtReflcfiionupon my Mind of my Circum>>

fiance,. l I 4-9 l

fiance, while I was making this Boat 3 but I ihould
have immediately thought how I {hould get It into
the Sea 5 but my Thoughts were fo intent upon my
Voyage ove- the Sea in it, that I never once conli~
der'd how ] thould get it off of the Land 3 and It
was really in its own Nature more eafy for me to
guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than about
forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to fet it a
float in the Water.

I went to work upon this Boat the mofl like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any of his Senfes
awake I pleas'd my {elf with the Defign, with-
out determining whether I was ever able to under-
take it; not but that the Difficulty of launching
my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a.
flop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh
Anl'wer which Igave my felf,Let'5 firfl make it, I'll
autumn! I'llfiadfame way or other 2'0 get it along, when
'15: (10:40.

This was a molt prepoflerous Method; but the
Eagcrnefs of my Fancy prevail'd, and to work I
went. I fell'd a Cedar Tree: I queftion much
whether Salome" ever had fuch a one for the Build'
ing of the Temple at yera/alem. It was five Foot
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty two Foot, after which it lef-
fen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches:
It was not without: infinite Labour that I fell'd
this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more get-
ting the Branches and Limbs, and the vaft fpread-
.ing Head of it cut 09F, which 1 hack'd and hew'd
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexPi-efliblc
Labour: After this, it colt me a Month to Ihapc
it, and dub it to a Pmportion, and to fomething
like the Bottom of a Boat, that it might fwim up"-

L 3 right[I501

rightas it ought to do. lt cof'c me near three
Months more to clear the Infide, and work it out
{0, as to make an exaet Beat of it: This I did in~
deed without Fire, by mecr Mallet and Cliifibl, and
by the dint ofhard Labour, till I had brought it
to be a very handlbtne Peeing/ea, and big enough to
have carried fix and twenty Men, and confequently
big enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.

'W hen I had gone through this Work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really
. much bigger than I ever law a Canoe, or Periagua,
that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a
weary Stroke it had colt, you may he fure; and
there remain'd nothing but to get it into the Water 5
andhad 1 gotten it into the \Vatcr, I make no que-
fiion, but I {hould have begun the maddell Voyage,
and the mofl' unlikely to be pcrform'd, that ever
was undertaken.

But all my Devices to get it into the Water
fail'd me, though they coil me infinite Labour too.
It'lay about one hundred Yards from the Water,
and not more: But the firl't lnconvenience was, it
was up Hill towards the Creek; well, to take a-
way this Difcouragement, I refolv'd to dig. into
the Surface of the Earth, and fo make a Deehvrty:
This I begun, and it colt me a prodigious deal of
Pains; but who grudge Pains, that have their
Deliverance in View? But when this was work'd
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was filll
much at one; forI could no more ilir the Canoe,
than I could the other Boat.

_ T her; Imeafur'd the Diflance of Ground, and
re'folv'd to cut :1 Dock, or Canal, tobring the VVa-
ter up to the Canoe, feeing 1 could not hung the
Canoe down to the "later: Well, I began this
Work, and when I began to enter into 1t: and cal'
culate how deep it was to be dug, how broiild,

W 0.
how the Stufi' to be thrown out, I found, that by
the number of Hands I had, being none but my
own, it mull have been ten or twelve Years before
Ifhould have gone through with it; for the Shore
lay high, ['0 that at the upper End it inuf't have
been at leafI twenty Foot deep; fo at length, tho'
with great Reluel'ancy, I gave this Attempt over
alfo.

This griev'd me heartily, and now I faw, tho'
too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we
count the Colt, and before we judge rightly of
our own Strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this Work, I finilh'd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniverfary with
the fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as
ever before; for by a conitant Study, and ferious
Application of the Word of God, and by the Al'-
filtance of his Grace, I gain'd a different Know-
ledge from what I had before. I entertain'd diffe-
rent. Notions of Things. I look'd now upon the
'World as a Thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no Expeetation. from, and indeed no De-
fires about: In a Word, I had nothing. indeed to
do with it, nor was ever like to have; to I thought
it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
viz. as a Place I had lived in, but was come out of
it; and well might I fay, as Father Abra/mm to
Diver, Between me and thee is a great Gulp/J fixed.

In the firfl Place, I was removed from all the
VViekednefs of the \Vorld here: I had neither the
Lafl of fine Fle/Io, I/ae LII/Z of 119:: Eye, or Me Pride of
Life. I had nothing to covet 3 for I had all that I
was now capable of enjoying: I was Lord of the
whole Manor, or ifl pleas'd, I might call my fell?
King, 01' Emperor over the whole Country, which
I had PoiTeHion of. There were no Rivals: I had
no Competitor, none to difpute Sovereignty o}:

.L 4, Command
Command with me. I might have rais'd Ship
Loadings of'Corn; but I had nol-ufe for it; (0 I
let as little grow as I thought enough: For my Oc-
cafionE-fI had Tortoife or Turtlesienough; but
now and then one was as much as -I could put to
any Life. ,-I had Timber enough to have built :1
Fleet 0F Ships. I had Grapes enough to have
made W ine,' or to have cur'd into Raifins, to have
loaded thataFleet when they .had been built.

But all I could make ufe of, was, All' that was
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to fupply my
'Wants; and, what was all the mil to me? If I
kill'd more Flelh than I could eat, the Dog muf't
eat it, or the Vermin. If I fow'd more Corn than
I could eat, it mull be fpoil'd, The Trees that I
cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground: I
could make no more ufe of them than for Fewel,
and that I had no Occafion for, but to drels my
Food.

In a "ford, The Nature and Experience of
Things die'tated to me upon jufl Reflee'tion, that
all the good Things of this World, are no farther
good to us, than they are for our Ufe; and that
Whatever we may heap up indeed to give others,
we enjoy juf't as much as we can ufe, and no more.
The molt covetous griping Mifer in the World
Would have been cured of the Vice of Covctoufnels,
if he had been in my Cafe; forI Poffcfl'cd infinitely
more than I knew what to do with, 1 had no room
for Defire, except it was of Things which I had
not, and they were but T rifles, though indeed of
great ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, :1 Par-
acel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty
{1x Pounds Sterling: Alas I there'the nafly forry
ufelefs Stuff lay; Ihad no manner of Bufincfs
for it; and I often thought with myfelf, that I
Would have given a Handful of it for a Grol's of

Tobacco-u
Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill'to grind my
Corn ; nay, Iwould have given it all for SS1xpennye
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or:
for a Handful of Pmfl' and Beam, and a Bottle of
Ink : fly it was, I had not the leai't Advantage by it,
or Benefit from it 3 but there it lay in a Drawer,
and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave m
the wet Seafon 3 and if I had had the Drawer full of
Diamonds, it had been the fame Cafe; and they
had been of no manner of Value to me, becaufe of
no Ufe.

I had now brought my State of Life to be much
eafier in it {elf than it was at firit, and much eafier
to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently
fat down to my Meat with Thanlifuliicls, and ad-
mired the Hand of God's Providence, which had
thus fpread my Table in the VVildeI-nefs. I learned
to look more upon the bright fide of my Condi-
tion, and lefs upon the dark {ides and to confider
what Ienjoy'd, ratherthan what I wanted; and
this gave me fometimes fuch fecret Comforts, that
I cannot expi'els them 5 and which I take Notice
of here, to put thofe difcontented People in Mind
of it, who cannot enjoy comFortably what God
has given them 3 becaule they fee, and covet fome~
thing that he has not given them: All our Difcon-
tents about what we want, appeared to me, to
apring from the want of Thankfulnefs for what we

ave. ~

Another Refleetion was of great Ufe to me, and
doubtlels would be f0 to any one that {hould fall
into fuch Diflrels as mine was 5 and this was, to
compare my prefent Condition with what I at firfl'.
cxpeeted it ihould be 5 my, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good Providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the Ship to be
call up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could

come
come at hei', but could bring what Igot out of
her to the .Shore, for in): Relief and Comfort 5
Without which, I IiadT'Wanted for Tools to work,
Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot
for getting my Food.

I fpcnt whole Hours, I may-Fay whole Days, in
.'repref6nting to my {elf in the molt lively Colours,
how I muff have acted, if I had got nething out
of the Ship; how I could not have fo much as
got any Food,-.exccpt Fifh and Turtles; and that
as it was long before I found any of them, I mull:
have perifll'd firlt: That I fllould have liv'd, if I
had not perifhed, like a meet Savage: That if I
had kill'd a Goat, or {r Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to flea or open them, or part the Flefh
from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it up;
but muf't gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with
my Claws like a Beafl. .

Thef'e Reflcftions made me very fenfible of the
Goodnefs of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardlhips
and Misfortunes: And this part alfo I cannot but
recommend to the Reflection of thol'e, who are apt
in their Mdery, to fay, I: my A'fiifiion like mifle!
Let them, confidcr, How much worfe the Cafes of
ibme People are, and their Cafe might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.-

I had another Refleetion which aflifted me all'o
to comfort my Mind with Hopes 3. and this was,
comparing my prefcnt Condition With what I had
deferv'd, and had therefore Reafon to exPeet from
the Hand of Providence- I had liv'd a dreadful
Life, perfectly deflitute of the Knowledge and F eat
of God. 1 had been well inltrueted by Father and

Mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in
their early Endeavour-s, to mfufc a l'CllglOUS Awe

of what the Nature and End of my Being tegt'rir'd
of me. But alas ! falling early into the Sea-faring
Life, which of all the Lives is the mofi dcihtute
0F the Fear of God, though his Terrors. are al-
Ways before them; I fay, Falling .early into the
Sea-Faring Life, and into Sea-faring Company: .311
thatflittle Senfe of Religion which I had entertain- .
ed, was laugh'd out of me by my Mefi-Mates, by
aharden'd defpifing oF Dangers, and the Views of
Death, which grew habitual to me, by my long
Abfence from all manner of Opportunities to con--
verfe with any Thing but what was like my felf,
or to hear any Thing that was good, or tended
towards it. .

5o void was Iof' every Thing that was good, or
of the leafi Senfe of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greatefl: Deliverances I enjoy'd, fuch
as my Efcape from Salle 5 my being taken up by
the Portuguefe Mailer of the Ship; my being plant.

from England, and the lil<e5 I never had once the

much as a Thought to pray to him, or fo much as
to fay, Lord [mm mercy upon "2495 no nor to men-
tion the Name of God, unlefs it was to {wear by,
and blafpheme it.

I had terrible Refieetions upon my Mind for
many Months, as I have already obferv'd, on the
account of my wicked and hardned Life pai'c 5 and
when I looked about me, and confidered what parti-
cular Providenccs had attended me fince my com-
ing into this Place, and how God had dealt boun-
tifully with me 5 had not only puniihed me lefs than
my Iniquity had dcferv'd, but had fo plentifully pro-
vided'for me 5 this gave me great Hopes. that my

' : Repen-
Repentance was accepted, and that'God had" yet
'Mercy in fiore For me. _ -
With thefe Reflefitions I work'd my Mind up,
not only to Refignation to the Will of God in the
prefen't Difpofition ofmy Circumflanc'cs; but own
'to a fincereThankFulnels For my Condition 5 and that
'I, who was yet a living Man, ought not to com-
plain, {eeing I had not the due Pundhment otTm'y
Sins; that l enjoy'd {'0 many Mercies which I had
no reafon to have expected in that Plaza-:5 that i
ought never more to repine at my COHditl!)3";,17-UPS to
rejoice, and to give daily Thanks for that. daily
Bread, which nothing bur a Croud nf'Wmaders could
have brought. Thatl ought to confider I had been
fed even by a Miracle, even as great as that of feed-
ing Elijah by Ravens; nay, by a long Series of Mi-
racle-s, and that I could hardly have nam-'d'a Place
in the unhabitable part Ofthe World when: I could
have been cal't more to my Advantage : A Place,
where as I had <<no Society, which was my Aflli-
etion on one Hand, fo 1 found no ravenous Beafts,
no Furious Wolves or Tygcl's to threaten my Life,
no venomous Creatures of poiibnous, which 1 might
feed on to my Hurt, no Savages to murder and de-

vour me. '
In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one

way, {0 it was a Life of _Mercy, another; and I
wanted nothing to make It a Life of Comfort, but
to be able to make my Some of God's Goodnefs to
me, and Care over me In this Condition, be my
daily Confolation ; and. after I did make a jufl:
Improvement of thefe things, I went away and was

no more fad.
II had now been here {0 king, that many things

which I brought on Show for my Help, were ei-
ther quite gone, or very much wafled and near

My Ink, as Iobferved, had been gone for Fame

Times pafl', I remember that there was a flrange
Concurrence of Days in the various Providences
which hefel me; and which, if I had been fuperfli-
tioufly inclin'd to obferve Days as Fatal or Fortu-
nate, [might have had Reafon to have look'd upon
with a great deal of Curiofity.

Firft I had obferved, that the lame Day that I
broke away From my Father and my Friends, and
run away to Hall, in order to go to Sea 3 the fame
Day afterwards I was taken by the Sal/e Man of
War, and made a Slave. . -

The {tune Day of the Year that I elbaped out of
the Wreck of that Ship in Tarmoatb Roads, that
fame Day-Year afterwards I made my efcape from
Salk" in the Boat. -

The fame Day of the Year I was born on ('0in
the goth of September, the famcDayI had my Life
fo miraculoufly faved 26 Years after, when I was
cart on Shore on this Ifland; fo that my wicked
Life and my folirary Life begun both on a Day.

The next Thing to my Inlt's being walled, was
that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I
brought out of the Ship: This I had husbanded to
the luff Degree, allowing my {elf but one Cake of
Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite
without Bread for near a Year before I got any
Corn of my own; and great Reafonl had tatbe
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being,
as has been already obferved, next to miraculous.

My

My Cloaths began to decay too mightily: As to
Linnen, I had had none a good while, except fome
chequered Shirts which Ifound in the Chefls of the
other Seamen, and which I- carefully preferv'd, bc-
caufe many times I could bear no other Cloaths on
but a Shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that! had among all the Men's Cloaths of the Ship
almoft three dozen of Shirtsi There were all'o fe-
'veral thick Watch-Coats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear 5
- and tho' it is true, that the Weather was {0 vio-
lent hot that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I
could not go quite naked ; no, tho' I had been in-
clined to it, which I was not, nor could not abide
theThoughts of it, tho' I Was all alone. '

The Reafon why I could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the Heat of the Sun (0
well when quite naked, as with fomc Cloaths on;
nay, the very Heat frequently blificr'd my Skin;
whereas with aShirt on, the Air it {elf made fome
Motion, and whilltling under that Shirt was twofold
cooler than without it: N 0 more could I ever bring
my (elf to go out in the Heat of the Sun withOUt a
Cap or a Hat 3 the Heat of the Sun heating with
fuch Violence as it does in that Place, would give

'16 the Head-ach prefently, by darting fo directly-
on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on 5 {0 that I
could not bearit 5 whereas, if I put on my Hat, it
would prefently go away.

Upon thofe Views I began to confider about put-
ting the few Rags I had, which I called Cloaths,
into fome Order: I had worn out all the War}.
coats I had, and my Bulinel's was now to try if I
could not make Jackets out of the great Watcho
Coats WhiCh'I had by me, and with fuch other
Materials as- I' had 3 lo I, let to work a Tayloring,
or rather indeed a Botching, for 1' made molt

piteous159

pietous Work of it. However, I made {hifi to
make two or three new VVaftcoats, which I hoped
would ferve me a great while 5 as For Breeches or
Drawers, I made but a very'forry {hift indeed, till
afterward.

I have mentioned that I faved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones,
and I had hung them up flreteh'd out with Sticks
in the Sun, by which means fame of them were {0
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others
it feems were very uleful. The firf'c thing I made
of thefe was a great Cap for my Head, with the
Hair on the Ourfide to lhoor ofir the Rain; and
thisI perform'd {o well, that after this I made me
a Suit of Cloaths wholly of thefe Skins, that is to
fay, a Waficoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and
both loofe, for they were rather wanting to keep"
me cool than to keep me warm. I mull: not omit
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made;
for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worfe Taylor.
However, they were fuch as I made very good
Ihift with; and when I was abroad, if it happen'd
to rain, the Hair ofmy VValicoat and Cap being
outer-molt, I was kept very dry.

After thislfpcnt a- great deal of Time and Pains
to make me an Umbrella 5 I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one 5
I had feen them made in the Bmfilr, where they
are very ufeful in the great Hears which are there:
And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the Equinox 5 befides, as
1 was obliged to be much abroad, it was a moft
tafeful thing to me, as well for the Rains as the
Heats. I took a world of Pains at it, and wasa
great while before] could make any thing likely to
hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I
fpoil'cl 2. or 3 before I made one to my Mind 5 but

at
at lafi I made one that anfwer'd indiflcerently well 5
The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to (pread, but if it did not
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for
me any Way but jul'c over my Head, which would
not do. However, at lall, as I laid, I made one
to anf'Wer, and cover'd it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards, fo that it call of}. the Rains like a Pent-
houfe, and kept of? the Sun (0 efl'eeltually, that I
could walk out in the hotter} of the Weather with
greater Advantage thanI could before in the cool-
CH, and whenI had no need of it, could clofe it and
carry it under my Arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind be- .
ing entirely eompofed by refigning to the Will of
God, and throwing my {elf wholly upon the Dif-
pofal of his Providencc. This made my Life bet-
ter than fociable; for when I began to regret the
Want of Converfation,1 would ask my felf whether
thus converfing mutually with my own Thoughts,
and, as I hope Imay fay, with even God himfelf
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmol'c
Enjoyment of human Society in the World?

1 cannot fay that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary Thing happened to me, but I lived on
in the fame Cour-(e, in the lame Pofiure and Place,
jufi as before: The chief Things Iwas employ'd in,
befides my yearly Labourof planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al-
Ways kept upjul't enough to hate fuflicient Stock
of one Year's Provifions beforehand; I fay, befides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a
Canoe, which at hill 1 finifhed: So that by dig-
ing a Canal to it of fix Foot wide, and four Foot
deep>> I brought it into the Creek, almoft halfa
Mile, As for the firlt, which was f0 vafily big,

as
as I made it without confidering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how Ifhould be able to launch it; fo
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring
the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie where it
was, as a M'momndum to teach me to be wifer
flCXt Time: Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could
not get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where
I could not get the Water to it, at any leis Diftancc
than as I have laid, near half a Mile; yet as Ii'aw
it was practicable at lafl, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two Years about it, yet I never
grudg'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat
:0 go off to Sea at laflz.

However, though my little Periagua was fi-
nifh'd, yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable
to the Delign which I had in View, whenI made
the firl't; I mean, OF venturing over to the Term
Erma, where it was above forty Miles broad; ac-
cordingly, the Smallnefs of my Boat aflifted to put.
an End to that Defign, and nova thought no more
of it: But as I had a_ Boat, my next Deiign was to
make a Tour, round the Ifland 3 for as I had been
on the other Side, in one Place, crofling as I have
already defcrib'd it, over the Land; {0 the Difco--
veries I made in that little journey, made me very
eager to fee other Parts of the Coaft; and now I
had a Boat, I thought of nothing but failing
round the Ifland. ' '

For this Purpofe,' that I might do every Thing
with Diferetion and Confideration, I fitted up alit-
tle Maft to my Boat, and made a Sail to it, out of
fome of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in
{torts and of which I had a great Stock by me.

Having fitted my Malt and Sail, and try'd the
Boat, 1 found {he would fail very well: Then I
made little Lockers, orBoxes, at either End of my
Boat, to put Provifions, Necefl'aries and Ammuni- '

M tion,
t'ion, (9'5. into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or
the Sprye of the Sea 3 and a little long hollow
Place I cut in the lnfide of the Boat, where [could
lay my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over
it to keep it dry.

I fix'd' my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Stern,
like a Mall, to {land over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun oPF of me like an Auning; and
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage
upon the Sea, but never went Far out, nor far from
the little Creek; but at lai't being eager to View
the Circumference of my little Kingdom,l rcfolv'd
upon my Tour,and accordingly Iviehtall'd my Ship
for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of my Loaves
(Cakes I Ihould rather call them) of Barley Bread,
an Earthen Pot full of parch'd Rice, a Food I eat
a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, half a
Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more, and
two large \Vatch-coats, of thoie which, as I men-
tion'd before, I had fav'd out of the Seamen's
Chel'ts; thefe I took, one to lie upon, and the o-
ther to cover me in the Night.

It was the fixth of November, in the fixth Year
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe,
That I fet out on this Voyage, and I found it much
longer thanl expeeled; for though the lfland itfelF
was not very large, yet when 1 came to the Eafl
Side of it, I Found a great Ledge of Rocks lie out
above two Leagues into the Sea, fome above Wa-
ter, fome under it; and beyond that, a Shoal of
Sand, lying dry half a League more; fo that I was
oblig'd to go- a great Way out to Sea to double the
Point.

W hen firfi I difcover'd them, I was going to give
over my Enterprife, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
Sea 5 and above all, doubting how 1 {hould get back

again;
again; fo I came to an Anchor; for I had made
me a kind of an Anchor 5 with a piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.

Having l'ecur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and
went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which
{eem'd to over-look that Point, where I law the
full EXtent of it, and refolv'd to venture.

In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I
l'tood, l perceived a firong, and indeed, a molt fu-
rious Current, which run to the Eat/1, and even
came clofe to the Point; and I took the more no-
tice of it, beeaufe Ifaw there might be lome Dan-
ger, that when I came into it, 1 might be carry'd
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the lfland again; and indeed, had I not
gotten firlt up upon this Hill, I believe it would
have been: {0 5 for there was the fame Current on
the other fide the lfland, only, that it fet OE at
a Farther Diflance; and Ifaw there was a thong
Eddy under the Shore; fo 1 had nothing to do but
to get in out of the firfl; Current, and I Ihould pre-
fently be in an Eddy.

l lay here, however, two Days; becaufe the
"find blowing pretty freih at E. S. E. and that
being jult contrary to the faid Current, made a
great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; lb that it
was net fate for me to keep too clofe to the Shore
for the Breach, nor to go too far ofi" becaufe of
the Stream.

The third Day in the Morning, the Wind hao
ving abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I
ventur'd ; but I 'am a Warning Piece again to ali
1'th and ignorant Films; for no {ooner was I come
to the Point, when even I was not my Boar's
Length from the Shore, but I found my fell' in a
great Depth of "Tater, and a Current like the Sluice
of 3 Mill : It carry'd my Boat along with it;
' M 2. with
with fuch Violence, that all I could do, could
not keep her {0 much as on the Edge of it 3 but I
found it hurry'd me farther and farther out from
the Eddy, which was on my Left Hand. There
was no Wind flirring to help me, and all I could
do with my Paddlers ngify'd nothing; and now
I began to give my felfovcr forlof't; for as the Cur-
rent was on bothfides the lfland, I knew in a few
Leagues Diflance they mui't joyn again, and then
I was irrecoverably gone; nor did 1 fee any Pofli--
bility of avoiding it 5 {'0 that I had no Profpeei: be-
fore me but of perifhing; not by the Sea, for that
was calm enough, but of fiarving for Hunger. I
had indeed found a Tortoife on the Shore, as big
almoft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat 5 and I had a great Jar offrefh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vail Ocean, where to
be fure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or
Ifland, for a thoufand Leagues at leafi.

And now I {aw how eafy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the moft miferable Condi-
tion Mankind could be in, war/e. Now I look'd
back Upon my defolate folitary Ifland, as the molt
pleafant Place in the World, and all the Happinefs
my Heart could wifh for, was to be but there a~
gain. I Itrech'd our my Hands to it with eager
Wifhes. 0 happy Defart, {aid I, I {hall never fee
thee more! 0 miferable Creature, {aid I, whi4
ther am I going! Then Ireproach'd my felf with
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at
my lblitary Condition ; and now what would I give
to be on Shore there again? Thus we never fee
the true State of our Condition, till it is illuilrated
10 US by its Contraries, nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the Want of it. It is fearce
p0flible to imagine the Conficrnation l was now in,

' ' being
being driven from my beloved Ifland (For ['0 it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, al-
moi't two Leagues, and in the utmol't Defpair of
ever recovering it again. However, Iwork'd hard,
till indeed my Strength was almof't exhaufied, and
kept my Boat as much to the Nortbwam', that is, '
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
lay on, as pofiiblyl could 5 when about Noon, as
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit- '
tle Breeze of Wind in my Face, fpringing up from
the S. S. E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and
efpecially when in about half an Hour more, it
blew a pretty {mall gentle Gale. By this Time I
was gocten at a frightful Dil'tance from the Ifland,
and had the leaf't Cloud or hazy Weather interven'd,
I had been undone another Way too; for I had no
Compafs on Board, and lhould never have known
how to have fleer'd towards the Ifland, if I had
buc once loft Sight of it; but the Weather conti-
nuing clear, I apply'd my felf to get up my Malt
again, fpread my Sail, fianding away to the North
as much as poflible, to get out of the Current.

juf't as I hadfet my Malt and Sail, and the Boat
began to ftretch away, I {aw even by the Clearnefs
of the Water, {ome Alteration of the Current was
near; for where the Current was ('0 Ptrong, the
Water was foul; but perceiving the Water clear,
I found the Current abate, and prefently I found
to the Eafl, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the
Sea upon fome Rocks 5 thefe Rocks I found caus'd
the Current to part again, and as the main Strefs of
it ran away more Sour/verb, leaving the Rocks to
the North--E439, fo the other return'd by the Re-
pulfe of the Rocks, and made a l'trong Eddy,
which ran back again to the Nor'tla-hVe/i with a
very (harp Stream. '

M 3 They
They who know what it is to have a Reprieve
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be refcu-
ed from Thieves juft going to murder. them, or
who have been in fuch like Extremities, may gaefs
what my prefent Surprize ofJoy was, and how giad>>
ly Iput my Boat into the Stream of' this Eddy, and
the Wind alfo' freflming, how giadly I fpread my
Sail to it, running chcarfuliy before the Wind,
and with a firong Tide or Eddy under Foot.

, This Eddy carry'd me about a League in my
Way back again direetiy towards the ,Ifland, but
about two Leagues more to the Northward than
the Current which carried me away at fix-Ii; {'0 that-
When I came near the Ifland, I found my {elf open
to the Northern Shore of it, that is to thy, the o-
ther End of the Ifland oppofite to that which I
Went out from.

When I had made fomething more than a League
wof Way by the Help ofthis Current or Eddy,l found
it was {pent and ferv'd me no farther. However, I
found that being between the two great Currents,

(02%.) that on the South Side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the North, which lay about
a League on the other Side: I fay, between their:
two, inthe Wake of the Ifland, I found the Wa~
ter at leafi Fill and running no Way 3 and having
yet a Breeze of .Wind fair for me, Ikept on Pacer-
ing direfitly for the Ifland, tho? not making fuch
frefh Way 2131 did before.

About four a Clock in the Evening, being then
within about a League of the Ifland, I found the
Point of the Rocks which occafioned this Difafler,
flretching out, as is deferibed before, to the South-
ward, and cafting oi-F tthurrent more South ward.-
ly, had of courfe made another Eddy to the North,
and this I found very firong, but not direetly {ettiiig
the Way .my Court}: lay, which was due Wen], bug

a moalmof't full North. However, havinga Frefh Gale,
I firetch'd a-crol's this Eddy flanting N orth-wef't,
and in about an Hour came within about a Mile of
the Shore, where it being finooth Water, I foon
got to Land.

When I was on ShoreI Fell on my Knees and gave
God Thanks for my Deliverance, refnlving to lay
aiide all Thoughts of" my Deliverance by my Boat;
and refreihing my {elf with fuch Thingsas I had, I
brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a little Cove
that 1 had l'py'd under {ome Trees, and laid me
down to fleep, being quite {pent with the Labour
and Fatigue of the Voyage.

i was now at a great LOIS which way to get
Home with my Boat : I had run [0 much Hazard,
and knew too much the Cafe to think of attempt-
ingitby the 'Way I went out; and what might be
at the otherSfde (I mean the Well Side) I knew
not, nor had [any Mind to run any more Ventures;
{0 1 only reiolvcd in the Morning to make my Way
I-Vei'l'ward along the Shore, and to (be if: there was
no Creek where [might lay up my Frigate in Safe-
ty, {0 as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three Mile, or thereabour, waiting the Shore, I
came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over,
which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet
or Brook, where I found avery convenient Harbour
for my Boat, 'and where flie lay as if Ihe had been
in alittle Dock made on purpoie for her. Here I
put in, and having {tow'd my Boat very fafe, Iwent
on Shore to look about me, and fee whereI was.

Ifoon Found 1 had but alittle pais'd by the Place
where I had been before, when I travell'd on Foot. '
to that Shore; f0 taking nothing out of my Boat,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my March. The Way was
comfortable enough after inch :1 Voyage as I had -

M 4 been
been upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the
Evening, where I found every thing fianding 2131
left it 3 For I always kept it in good Order, being,
as I l'aid before, my Country-Home.

I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the
Shade to refitmy Limbs, For I was very weary, and
fellafleep: But judge you, if you can, that read my
Story, what a Surprize I mull be in, when I was
wak'd our of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by
my Name feveral times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crag/(re,
- Poor Robin Crufoe.' where are you Robin Cru/be?

Where are you? Where have you been P

I was {0 dead afleep at firft, being fatigu'd with
Rowing, or Paddling, as it is call'd, the firlt
Part of the Day, and with Walking the latter Part,
that I did not wake thoroughly 3 but dozing be-
tween fleeping and waking, thought I dream'd
that fome body {poke to me: But as the Voice
continu'd to repeat, Robin Crufoe, Robin Crufoe, at
1219: I began to wake more perfectly, and was at
- firfl dreadfully frighted, and flartcd up in the ut-

moft Confiernation : But no fooner were my Eyes

~open, than Ifaw my Pollfitting on the top of the
Hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that
fpoke to me 5 for jufi in fuch bemoaning Language
1 had ufed to talk to him, and teach him; and he
had learn'd it {o perfcelly, that he would fit upon
my Finger, and lay his Bill clofe to my Face, and
cry, Paar Robin Crufoe, iV/Jere are you ? Where
have yozr'eeen? How come you bare? and fuch things
asI had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the Parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body elfe, it was

a good while before I could compofe my {elf :
Firl'r, Iwas amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then how he {hould juf'c keep about the Place,
and no where elfc: But as I was well fatisfied Iictl

cou .Q'i [ 169]

could be no body but honei't Poll, I got it over;
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the fociable Creature came to me, and
fat upon my Thumb, as he ufed to do, and conti-
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and bow
did [come [Jere ? and ev/aere law! I been ? juf'r as if he
had been overjOy'd to fee me again 3 and fo I car-
ry'd him Home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for
fome time, and had enough to do for many Days
to fit fiill, and refleet upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again On my tide of the Ifland; but I
knew not how it was praeticable to get it about.
As to the Eaf't fide of the Ifland, which I had
gone round, I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way 3 my very Heart would flirink, and
my very Blood run chill to think of it: And as
to the other fide of the Ifland, I did not know
how it might be there 3 but fuppofing the Current
ran with the fame Force againft the Shore at the
Hall, as it pafs'd by, it on the other, I might run
the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream,
and carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before,
of being carry'd away from it; fo with thefe
Thoughts I contented my {elf to be without any"
Boat, though it had been the Produel: of {'0 many
Months Labour to make it, and of fo many more
to get it unto the Sea.

In this Government of my Temper I remain'd
near aYear, liv'd a very fedate retired Life, as
you may well fuppofe; and my Thoughts being
very much compofed .as to my Condition, and
fully comforted in refigning my felf to the Dif-
poiitions of Providence, I thoughtI liv'd real~
ly very happily in all things, except that of So>>
piety.

' I im-170] f

I improv'd my {elf in this time in all the mecha-
nick Exercifes which my Neeeflities put me upon
applying my felf to, and lbelieve I could, upon
Occafion, made a very good Carpenter, efpecially
confidering how few Tools I had.

Befidcs this, I arrived at an uneXpeeted Perfeelti-
on in my Earthen Ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a Wheel, which I found infi- .
nitely eafier and better; becaufe 1 made Things
round and ihapable, which before were fiithy

' Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-

ver more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for any think 1 found out, than for my being
able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was
a very ugly clumfy thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other earthen Ware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I
was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been
always ufcd to fmoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, bu: I forgot them at firfl, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in the lfland 5 and afterwards,
when I fearch'd the Ship again, I could not come
at any Pipes at all. ->>

In my Wicker Ware alfo I improved much, and
made abundance of neceflary Baskets, as well as
my Invention {hew'd me, though net very hand-
fome, yet they were fuch as were very handy and
convenient for my laying Things up in, or fetching
Things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a (mat
abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and
drefs it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in
a Basket; and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the Eggs, and a piece or two or the
Flcih, which was enough for me, and bring them
home in a Basket, and leave the red behind
me. Alfo large deep Baskets were my Recei-

vers of my Corn, which I always rubb'd ouft as
con
foon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
Baskets. _

I began now to perceive my Powder abated con-
fiderably, and this was a Want which it was im-
poflible for me to fupply, and I began {etioufly to
confider what I muit do when Ifhnuld have no
more Powder; that is to lay, how I ihould do to
kill any Goat. I had, as l obferv'd in the third
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred
her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He-
Goat, but 1 could not by any means bring it to
pars, an my Kid grew an old Goats and I could
never find in my Heart to kill her, till {he dy'd at
lalt of mere Age. ,

But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi-
dance, and, as I have laid, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I fet my fell to f'tudy fome Art to trap and
fnare the Goats, to fee whether I could not catch
fome of them alive, and particularly. I wanted a She-
Goat great with Young

To this purpofe I made-Snares to hamper them,
andl do believe thCY were more than once taken
.in them, but'my Tackle was noc good, for I had
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my
Bait devoured.

At length I l'ngIVCd to try a. Pit-fall , f0 I dug
fever-a1 large Pits in the Earth,~ in Places Where I
had obferved the Goats ufed to feed, and over thefe
Pits I placed Hurdles of my own making too,
with a great Weight upon them 5 and feveraltimes
I put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without fet-
ting the Trap, and I could eafily perceive that the
Goats had gone if! and eaten up the Corn, for I
could fee the Mark of their Feet. At length I fet
three Traps in one Night, and going the next
Morningl found them all itanding, and yet the
Bait eaten and gone. This was very difcourafiing;

0W9
HOWCYCB I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble
you With Particulars, going one Morning to l'ee my
Tran, I found in one of them a large o-ld I-Ie-Goat,
and in one of the other three Kids, a Male, and
mm Females. '

. As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was {0 fierce I duril not go into the Pit to
him 5 that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
ltill'd him, but that was not my Bufinefs, nor would
' it anfwer my End. 50 I e'en let him out, and he
ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his Wits: ButI had forgot then what I recolleeted
afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I
had let him {lay there three or four Days withou:
Food, and then had carry'd him fome Water to
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been
as tame as one of the Kids, For they are mighty
fagajcious ti'aetable Creatures where they are well
ufe .

However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
.-no better at that time 3 then I went to the three
Kids, and taking them one by one, I tyed them
with Strings together, and with fome Difficulty
brought them all home.

. It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fweet Corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame : and now I found that
if I expeeted to fupply my felf with Goat-Fleih
when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding fome
up tame was my only Way, when perhaps I
might have them about my Houfe like a Flock of
Sheep.

But then it prefently occur'd to me, that I mull:
keep the Tame from the Wild, or elfe they would
always run wild when they grew up 5 and the only

Way for this was to have (came enclofed Piece of
Ground
Ground, well fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to
keep them in lo effectually, that thofe within might
not break out, or thofe without break in.

This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands, yet as I faw there was an abfolute Neccf--
fity of doing it, my full Piece of Work was to
find out aproper Piece of Ground, viz. where there
Was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from
the Sun.

T hofe who underfland fuch Enclofures will think
I had very little Contrivance, when I pitch'd Upon
aPlace very proper for all thefe, being a plain o-
pen piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna, (as our
People call it in the Wefiern Colonies.) which had
two or three little Drills of frefh Water in it, and
at one end was very woody: I fay they will {mile
at my Forecafi, when I {hall tell them I began my
enclofing of this Piece of Ground in fuch a man-
ner, that my Hedge or Pale mufi: have been at leaft
two Mile abour. Nor was the Madncfs of it fo
great as to the Compals, for if it was ten Mile a-
about I was like to have time enough to do it in.
Butl did not confider that my Goats would be
as wild in (0 much Compafs,' as if they had had the
whole Ifland, and I ihould have fo much Room
to chace them in, that I ihould never catch
them. .r

My Hedge was begun and .carry'd on, I believe,
about fifty Yards , when this Thought occurr'd
to me 5 {o I prefently Ptopt fhort, and for the firi'c
beginning I refolv'd to enclofe aPiece of about IfO
Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which
as it would maintain as many as I ihould
have in any reafonable time, [0 as my Flock en-
creafed, 1 could add more Ground to my En-
clofure.

t This
This was aEting with fome Prudence, and I went
to work with Courage. I was about three Months
hedging in the Full: Peice, and till I had done it I
tether'd the three Kids in the beft part of it, and
us'd them to feed as near me as pofiible to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and car-
ry them fome Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice,
and feed them out of my Hand 3 fo that after my
Enclofure was finifhed, and I let them loofe, they
would follow me up and down, bleating after me
for a handful of Corn.

This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and
half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids
and all; and in two Years more I had three and
Forty, befides feveral that I took and kill'd for my
Food. And after that Ienclofed five feveral Pie-
ces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens to
drive them into, to take them as Iwanted, and
Gates out of one Piece of Ground into ano-
thcr.

But this was not all, for nowI not only had
Goats~Flcfl1 to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
. pl'IZC- For now I let up my Dairy, and had fome
times 3 Gallon or two of Milk in a Day, And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature, dictates even naturally how to make ufe
of it 5 fo I that never milk'd a Cow, much lefs
a Goat, or had feen Butter or Cheefe made, very
readily and handily, tho' after a great many Efiays
and Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe
at lafi, and never wanted it afterwards. '

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
Creatures, even in thofe Conditions in which they
fecm to be overwhelm'd in Defiruetionl How

can
can he fweeten the bitterefi Providences, and give
' us caufe to praife him for Dungeons and Prilons!
What aTable was here fpread for me in a VVilder-
nefs, where I law nothing at firft but to periih for
Hunger! ,

It would have made a Stoick {mile to have feen,
me and my little Family {it down to Dinner; there
was my Majelly the Prince and Lord of the whole
Ifland; I had the Lives of all my Subjeets at my
abfolute command. I could hang, draw, give Li-
berty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all
my Subjeets. '

Then to fee how like a King I din'd too all
alone, attended by my Servants; Poll, as if he had
been my Favourite, was the only perfon permit-
ted to talk to me. My Dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy, and had found no Species to
multiply his Kind upon, fat always at my Right
Hand 5 and two Cats, one on one Side the T a-
ble, and one on the other, expee'ting now and
then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of fpecial
Favour. . -

But thefe were not the two Cats which Ibronght
on Shore at firfl, for they were both 0? them dead,
and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my
own Hand; but one of them having multiply'd by
I know not what Kind of Creature, thefe were
two which I had preferv'd tame, whereas the rell:
run wild in the Woods, and became indeed trou-
blefc'im to me at 121?: 5 for they would often come
into my Houfe, and plunder me too, till at half I
was obliged to {boot them, and did kill a great
many; at length they left me: With this Attem
dance, and in this plentiful Manner I liv'd; nei-
ther could I be {aid to want any thing but Society,
and of that in fome time after this, 1 was like to
have too much.

I was
I was fomething impatient, as I have obferv'd,
to have the ufe of my Boat; though very loth to
run any more Hazards; and therefore fometimes I
fat contriving Ways to get her about the Ifland,
and at other Times I fat myfelf down contented
renough without her. But Ihad a firange Uneafinefs
in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland,
Where, as I have faid, in my lal't Ramble, I went up
the Hill to fee how the Shore lay, and how the
. Current fet, that I might fee what I had to do: This
Inclination" increas'd upon me every Day, and at
length I refolv'd to travel thither by Land, follow-
ing the Edge of the Shore. I did (0: But had any
one in England been to meet fuch a Man as I was, it
mufi either have frighted him, or rais'd a great deal
of Laughter; and as I frequently flood {till to look
at my felf, I could not but fmile at the Notion of
my travelling through Ibrlejkz're with fuch an Equi-
page, and in fuch a Drefs: Be pleas'd to take a
Sketch of my Figure as follows.

I had a great high {hapelefs Cap, made of a
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the Sun from me, as to {hoot the Rain
off from running into my Neck; norhing being {'0
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the
Flefh under the Cloaths.

I had afhort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts co-
ming down to about the middle of my Thighs;
and a pair of open-kuee'd Breeches of the fame 5 the
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-goat,
whofe Hair hung down fuch a Length on either
Side, that like Pam'aloom it reach'd to the middle of
my Legs; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but had
made me a Pair of fome-things, I fearce know
what to call them, like Buskins, to flap over my
Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter~daihlSS=ss

ut
but of a mop: barbarous Shape, as indeed were all
the left of my Cldaths. .

I had on a broad Belt of Goats-Skin dryed,
which I drew together with two Thongs of the
fame, infl'cad 'ofBuckles, and in a kind of a F mg-
on either Side of this, Inflead of 21 Sword and a
Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on
one Side,- one on the other. I had another 8611:
not [0 broad, and falle'n'd in the fame manner,-
which hung over my Shoulder 5 and at the End of
it, under my Left Arm, hung tWO Pouches, both
made of Goats-Skin too; in one of which hung
my Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I
carried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and
over my Head a great clurnly~ ugly GoaDSkm Um-
brella, but which, after all, was the mod: neceflary
Thing I had about me, neXt to my Gun: AS {91'
my Face, the Colour of it was really not {011401017555
like, as one might expect From a Man not at all care-'-
ful of it, and living within nine or ten Degrees of the
Equinox. My Beard I had once fuller'd to grow till
it was about a quarter of aYar'd long; but as [had
both Sciflars and Razors quficient, 1 had cut it preto
ty fliort, except what grew on my upper Lip, which
I had trimm'd into a large Pair of Mabometan W h it'-
kers, fuch as I had feen Worn by tome 'f mks, who I
{aw at Sal/e 5 for the Moor: did not wear fuch, tho'
the T ark: did 5 of thefe Multachioes or Whiskers, I
will not fay they Were long enough to hang my Hat
upon them; but they were of Length and Shape
monllrous enough, and luch as in Efiglam' would
have palS'd for frightful;

But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I
had {0 few to obfcrve me, that it was of no man-
ner of Confequence 5 {o liay no more to that Part.-
In this kind of Figure I went my new journey, and
Was our: five or .13): Days. I travell'd firi't along the

N Sea
Sea-Shore, direetly to the Place where I firfi brought
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks 5
and having no Boatnow to take care of, I went 0--
ver the Land a nearer Way, to the fame Height that.
I was upon before; when looking forward to the
Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which I Was
oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is faid above,
I was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fmooth and quiet,
-no Riphrzg, no Motion, no Current, any more there
than in other Places. "

I was at a l'trange Lois to underfiand' this, and
refolv'd to {pend loinc Time in the obferving it, to
fee if nothing from the Sets of the'I'ide had occa-
fion'd it; but [was prefently convinced how it was,
cvz'z. That the'i'ide of Ebb fetting from the IVefl,
and joining with the Current of Waters from fome
great River on the Shore, muf't be the occafion of
this Current ; and that according as the W ind blew
more forcibly from the Wefl, or From the North,
this Current came near, or went farther from
Shores {Or waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went
up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb
being made, I plainly {aw the Current again as be-
fore, only, that it run farther of}, being near half a -
League from the Shore; whereas in my Cafe, it
Yet clofe upon the Shore, and hurried me and my
Canoe along with it, which at another time it
Would not have done.

This Obfervation convinc'd me, That I had no-
thing to do but to oblerve the Ebbing and the ,'
Flowing ofthe Tide, and Imight very eafily bring
my Boat about the Ifland again: But when I be-
gan to think of putting it in practice, I had fuck a
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of
the Danger I had been in, that 1 could not think
of it again with any Patience 5 but on the contrary:

I took up another Refolution,which was more liti'ca '
though
though more laborious 5 and this was, that Iwould
build, or rather make me another Pariagm or Caze
awe; and fo have one for one Side of the lfland, and
one for the other. '

You are to underftand, that now I had, as I
may call it, two Plantations in the Ifland 5 one my
little F ortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me,
which by this time I had enlarg'd into leVeral
Apartments, or Caves, one within another. One -
of thefe, which was the dryefi', and largefi, and
had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification 3
that is to fay, beyond where my Wall join'd to
the Rock, was all .fill'd up with the large Earthen
Pots, of which lhave given an Account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold
five or fix Buihels each, where I laid up my Stores
of Provifion, efpecially my Corn, fome in the Ear
cut off {hort from the Straw, and the other'rubb'd
out with my Hand. '

As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes
or Piles, thofe Piles grew all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown (0 big, and {pread {0 very
much , that there was I'iOt the leaft Appearance to'
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.

Near this Dwelling. ot'mine, but a littlefarther
Within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yieldedme'
their Harveft in its Seafon", and whenever I had
occafion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoine
ing as fit as that.

Bcfides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had
now a tolerable Plantation there alfo 5 tor firli, I
had my little Bower, asI call'd it, which I kept
in Repair; t/mt is to fay, I kept the Hedge which
ended it in, confiantly listed up to its uiual HeiglLt,
' . 2. I 3the Ladder flanding always in the Infide; I kept
the Trees which at firfi were no more than my
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall 5 I '
'kept them always {0 cut, that they might {pread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
Shade, which they did ePfee'tnally to my Mind. In
the Middle of this I had my Tent alt'vays fianding,
_ being a Piece of a Sail fpread over Poles fet up for
"that Ptii'pofe, and which never wanted any Repair
or Renewing; and under this I had made mea Squab
- orCoueh, with the Skins of the Creatures I had
kill'd, and with other {oft Things, and a Bilan'
ket laid on them, fuch as belong'd to our Sea~Bed-
ding, which I had fiivcd, and a great VVatch-Coat
to cover me 3 and here, whenever I had Occafion
to be abfent from my chief Seat, I took up my
Country Habitation. _

Adjoining to this I had my Encloi'ures For my Catv
tle, that is to fay, my Goats: And as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and en'Cloi'e
this Ground, {0 [ was (0 uneai'y to fee it kept entire,
leit the Goats fhould break thro', that I never left
off~ till with infinite Labour I had (luck the Outfide
of the Hedge {0 full of finall Stakes, and fo near to
one another, that it was ratheraPale than :1 Hedge,
and there was fcarce Room to put a Hand thro'
between them, which afterwards when thofe Stakes ,
grew, as they alldid in the next rainy Seafon, made
the Enclofure flrong like a Wall, indeed fironget
than any Wall.

This will tefiify for me that I was not idle,
and that I {pared no Pains to bring to pafs What-
ever appear'd neceflary for my comfortable Sup-
port; for! confider'd the keeping up a Breed of
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a liv-

ing Magazine of'Fleih, Milk, Butter and Cheeti'e,
or
for me as long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be
forty Years, and that keeping them in my Reach, -
depended entirely upon my perfee'cing my Enclo--
fures to fuch a Degree, that I might be fure of
keeping them together; which by this Method in-
deed I lb cheftually fecur'd, that when thcfe lit-
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them To
very thick, I was forced to pull lbme of them up
again.

In'this Place alfo Ihad my Grapes growing,
which I principally depended on For my Winter
Store of Railins; and which I never fail'd to pre-
ferve very carefully, as the belt and moll: agreeable
Dainty of my whole Diet; and indeed they were
not agreeable only, but phyfical, wholefome, nou,
rifhing, and refrefliing, to the hill Degree.

As this was alfo about half the Way between my
other Habitation and the Place wereI had laid up
my BOat, I generally llay'd, and lay here in my
Way thither; for I ufed frequently to vifit my
3an, and I kept allThings abOUt or belonging to
her 111 very good Order; fometimes I went out
in her to divert my fell, but no more hazardous
Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a
Stone's Call 0.1' two from the Shore, I was fo ap,~
prellcnfive of being hurried out of my Knowledge
again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Ac~
CidCflt- But now I come to anew Scene ol'my Life.

It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards
my 30ml was exceedingly furpriz'd with the Print
of a Man's naked Foot on {the Shore, which Was
very Plain to be feen in the Sand; 1 fiood like one
Thunder-Punch, or as if I had feen an Apparition 5
Ilil'ten'd, Ilook'd round me, Icould hear nothing,
QOI' (C? any thing; I went up to. a rifing Ground [0.
19015 telrther 5 1 went up the Shore and down the

5,1103; but, it, Was all one, I could fee no other
N 5 Imprcflion
. Impreflion but that one, I went to it again to fee
if there were any more, and to obl'erve il' it might
not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for
that, for there was exaetlyi the very Print of :1 Foot,
Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the leaf:
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts,
like a Man per'fefily confirs'd and out ofmylhll, I
' came Home to my Fortification, n0t feeling, as we
fay, the Ground 1 went on, but terrify'd to the laft
Degree, looking behind me at every two or three
Steps, mif'taking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a Dii'tance to be a Man; nor is
it poflible to del'cribe how many various Shapes af-
frighted Imagination reprel'ented Things to me in 5
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what firange unaccountable
\Vhimfies came into my Thoughts by the \Vay.

When I came to my Came, {0th [think I call'd
it ever after this, I fled into it like one purified;
whether I went over by the Ladder as firl't con-
triv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
I call'd a Door, 1 cannot remember 5 no, nor could
I remember the next Morning; For never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or'FOX to Earth, with more
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat.

I {lept none that Night; the farther I was from
the Occafion of my Fright, the greater my Ap--
prehenfions were ; which is fomething contrary to
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the u--
fual Praetice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was
{0 embartafs'd with my own frightful Ideas of the
Thing, that I IrOl'm'd nothing but difinal Imagina-
tions to my (elf, even tho' I was now a great wa '
offit. Sometimcsl fancy'd it mul't be the De-
vil; and Reafon joyn'd in with me upon this Sup:-
pofition: For how {hould Any other Thing in hu~

man
man Shape come into the Place? Where was the
Vefi'd that brought them 3 What Marks was there
0." any oth'f-'z Footfteps? And how was it poffible
a Man {hauld come there? But then to think that
Santa mould take human Shape upon him in fucha
Place wherethere could be no manner of Occafion
for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind
113m, and that even Forno Purpol'e too, for he could
not be {ure I ihould fee it; this was an Amufement
the other Way: I confidered that the Devil might
have found out abundance of other Ways to have
terril'y'd me than this of the {ingle Print of at Foot.
That as l liv'd quite on the other Side of the Ifland,
he would never have been {0 fimple to leave a Mark
in a Place where it was Ten Thou'fitnd to one whe-
ther l fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand
too, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defac'd entirely: All this feem'd
inconfiflzent with the Thing it felF, and with all the
Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty of the
Devil.

Abundance of fuch Things as thefe aflilted to 211'?
gue me out of all Apprehenfions of its being the
' Devil : And I prefently concluded then, that it mufl;
be fume more dangerous Creature. (vim) That it
mull be fome of the Savages of" the main Land
over-againl't me, who had wandered out to Sea in
their Canoes, and either driven by the Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Ifland; and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea,
being as loth, perhaps, to have ilay'd in this defo-
lace lfland, as I would have been to have had them.

While thefe Refleetions were rowling upon my
Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that
I was {0 happy as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did not fee my Boat, by which
they Would have concluded that lbme Inhabitants

N 4. had
had been iii the Place, and perhaps have fearch'd
fartherfor me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my
Imagination about their having found my Boat,
and that there Were People here; and that if f0, I
ihoUId certainly have .them come again in greater
N urhbers and devourme; that if it fluould happen
{0 that they ihould not 'find me, yet they would
find my Enclofure, defiroy all my Corn, carry a-
way all my Flo'ck of tame Goats, andI {hould pe-
'1fifh at lail: for mere Want. ' '

l _ Thus my Fear baniih'd all my Religious Hopee
all that former Confidence in God, which was
founded upon fuch wonderful Experience as I had
had 'of his Goodnefs, now vanifh'd, as if 'he that
had fed me by Miracle hithertoi, 'could not preferve
by his'Power the Provifion which he had made for
the by his Goodhelsi I reproach'd my {elf with my
Eafinefs, that would n01: {0"} any more Corn one
Year than Would jul't feryeme till the next Scafon,
as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my'
enjoying the Crop. that Was upon the Ground;
and this I thought fojuit aReprooF, that lrel'olv'd
for the future to have two or three Years Corn be-'
fore hand, fo that whatever might come, I might
not perii'h for want of Bread. ' '

How {trange a Chequer- Work of Providence is
the Life of Man! and by what fecret differing
Springs are the Affeetions hurry'd about, as differ-a
ring Circumflancesprefent! To Day we love what
to Morrow wehate '5' to Day Weleek what to Mori
row We ihun; to Day we defire what to "Morrow
we fear 5 my, even'trernble at the Apprehenfions of:
(This Was exemplified in meat this time in the molt
lively Manner imaginable: for I whofe only Af-
flifition W335 that l feem'd banilhed frOm human
30-day: that, I 'was alone, CirCUmfcrib'd by the
boundlefs OCean, "Cut Off from Mankind, and cone
. i'al='='~',.. .'.-. '. .. ; ... gemnfe
,demn-'d to what I call'd {ilent Life; that I was as
bne whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
ber'd among the Living, or to appear among the
refl of his Creatures; that to have feen one of my
own Species would have feem'd to me a Railing
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Blefling
that Heaven itfelf, next to the fupreme Blefiing of
Salvation, Could bellow; Ifay, that Iihould now
tremble at the very Apprehenfions of feeing a Man,
and was ready to fink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or filent Appearance of a Man's having
let his Foot in the Ifland. .

Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it
afforded me a great many curious Speculations at?-
terwards. When '1 had a little recovered my firfl:
Surprize; I confider'd that this was the Station of
Life the infinitely wife and good Providence of
God had determin'd for me; that as I could not
forefee what the Ends of Divine Wifdom might be
in all this, {0 I was not to difpute his Sovereignty,
who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and difpofe of me ab-
folutely as he thought fit, and who, as I was a
Creature who had offended him, had likewife a ju-
dicial Right to condemn me to what Punilhmcnt
he thought fit; and that it was my part to fubmit
to hear his Indignation, becaufe I had finn'd againll:
him. -

' I then reflected that God, who was not only
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought
fit thus to punifh and afflict me, {0 he was able
to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it,
'twas my unquefiion'd Duty to refign my {elf abfodeg
Intel and entirely to his Will; and on the other
han , it was my Duty alfo to hope in him,- pray
tq him, and quietly to attend the Dietares and Di-
te'elions of his daily Providence. ' '

There Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days,
my, I may fay, Weeks and Months; and one par-
ticular Efl'eet of my Cogitations on this Oeealion,
I ezmnOt omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in
my Bed, and fiil'd with Thought about-my Danger
from the Appearance of Savages, I found it (iii:-
compos'd me very much 5 upon which thoie VJ ords
of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call 21/7073
me in the Day of Trouble, and I will claim-er, am! 1/9025
fizz/t glorz'fjx me.

Upon this, tiling cheari'uily out o'i' my Bed, my"
Heart was not only comhrted, but i was guided
and encouraged to pray eamel'rly to God for Beli-
verance: Vth I had done praying, I took up my
Bible, and opening it to read, 'the E-rfl V-fords that
pi'elEnted to me, were, [If/(52'! 0;: the 1,971], am! be of
good Cheer, am! he flmll fli'eflgl'bcfi f/Jy Heart; wait,
[[235 on the: Lord. It is impoflihle to exprefs the
Comfort this gave me. In Anl'wer, I thankfully
laid down the Book, and was no more fad, a: leait
not on that Oceafion.

In the middle of thefe Cogitations, Apprehenfi-
ons and Reflcetions, it came into my Thought one
Day, that all this might be a mere Chimera of my
own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, whenI came on Shore from my Boat:
This ehear'd me up a little too, and I began to per-g
{uade my {elf it was all aDelufion; that it was no:

thing elfe but my own Foot; and why might nor I
come that way from the Boat, as well as I was go-.
ing that way to the Boat: Armin, I confider'd alfo
that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not ; and that if at lai'c
this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had
play'd the part of thofc Fools, who (have to make
Stories of Speftrcs and Apparitions, and then are
fi'ighted at them more than anybody. '
. Now
Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad
again; forI had not {lirr'd out of my Caiilefor three
:Days and Nights; fn that I began to fiarve for
Prdvifion; forI had litti: or nething within Doors
but fome Barley 2=2akcs and \i'i'ater. Then I knew
that my Goats '~.".'1';'{lf(.'Ll to he milk'd too, which
initially was my Evening Diverfion; and the poor
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenicnce for
want of'it; and indeed, it almoli; 1-poil'd Tome of
them, and almofi: dry'd up their Milk.

Heartning my {ch there-tore with the Belief that
this was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet, and (0 I might be truly {aid to {tart at my
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country Houfe to milk my Flock ; but
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it
would have made-any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conl'cience, or that 1 had been late-
ly molt terribly frighted, and {o indeed I had.

However, asI went down thus two or three
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle holder 3 and to think there was really nothing in
it, but my own Imagination: But I cou'd not per-
fuade my {elf fully of this, till I {hould go down to
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and
meafure it by my own, and fee if there was any Si-
militude or F itnefs, that I might be afliir'd it was
my own Foot: Bur when I came to the Place,
Fir/Z, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid
up my Boat, I could nor pofiibly be on Shore any
where there about. Serum/1y, W hen I came to meac
lure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
not {0' large by a great deal 5 both thcfc Things fill'd
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again, to the higheit Degree; {0 that I

Ihook
filook with cold, like one in an Ague: And Iwent
Home again, fill'd with the Belief that fome Man
or Men had been on the Shore; or in flaort, that the
Ifland was inhabited, andI might be furpriz'd be:-
fore I was aware; and what courfe to take for my
Security I knew not. -

0 what ridiculous Refolutions Men take, when
pofl'efs'd with Fear! It deprives them of the Ufe of
thofe Means which Reafon offers For their Relief.
The firfl: thing I propos'd to my felf, was, to
throw down my Enclofures, and turn all my tame
Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might
not find them; and then frequent the Ifland in Prof-
pea: of the fame, or the like Booty : Then to the
fimple thing of digging up my two Corn Fields,
that they might not find Inch 2; Grain there, and
fiill be prompted to frequent the Ifland; then to de-
molifh my Bower and Tent, that they might not
fee any Vefiiges of Habitation, and be prompted
to look farther, in order to find out the Perfons
inhabiting.

Thefe were the Subjee't of the firf'c Night's Co-
gitation, after I was come Heme again, while the
Apprehenfions which had f0 over-run my Mind
were Frefh-upon me, and my Head was full of Va-
pours, as above. Thus Fear of danger is ten thou-
fand Times more terrifying than Danger it felt, when
apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen
of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which
we are anxious about 5 and which was wori'e than
all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble
from the Refignationl ufed to praelzife, which I
hop'd to have. Ilook'd, Ithought, like Sam], who
complain'd not only that the Bali/Zines were upon
him 5 but that God had forfaken him 3 for I did not
now take due Ways to compofe my Mind, by crying

to God in my Difircfs, and reiting upon his Proviv'
' ' l h ; deuce;deuce, as I had done before, for my Defence and
Deliverance; which if I had done, I had. at leafi,
been more cheerfully fupported under this new Sur-
prife, and perhaps carry'd through it With more Re-
folurion. ' '

This confufion of my Thoughts kept me waking
all Night; but in the Morning I fell afleep, and
- having by the Amufement of my Mind, been, as it
were tired, and my Spirits exhaufled, I flept very
foundly, and walt'd much better compos'd than'
I had ever been before: and now I began to think
fedatcly; and upon the utmofl: Debate with my
felf, I concluded, That this Ifland, which was fo
exceeding pleafant, fruitful, and no farther from the
main Land than as I had feen, was not fo entirely a-
bandon'd as I might imagine: That altho' there
were no flared Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot;
yet that there might fometimes come Boats off from
the Shore, who either with Defign, or perhaps
never but when they were driven by crofs Winds
might come to this Place.

That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had
not met with the leaf: Shadow or Figure of any
People yet; and that if at any Time they fllould be
driven here, it was probable they went away again
as foon as ever they could, feeing they had never
thought-fit to fix there upon any Occafion, to this
Time.

That the mofl: I cou'd fuggeft any Danger from,
was, from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of
ilraggling People from the Main, who, as it was
likely if they were driven hither, were here againfl:
their Wills; fo they made no Pray here, but went off
again with all pofiible" Speed, feldom ilaying one
Night on Shore, lealt they ihould not have the
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again 5 and

that therefore I had nothing to do but to confiderPS
'o
of form fiiFe Retreat, in cafe 1 fhould fee any Savaa
ges land upon the Spot.

' Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug
my Cave {0 large, at to bring a Door through a--
gain, which 33%;, asl faid, came out beyond where
my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock: upon mature-
ly confide-ring this therefore, I refolv'd to draw me
a fecond Fortification, in the fame Manner ot'a Se-'
micircle, at a Dif'tance from my Wall, jui'c where I
had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelve
Years before, of which I made mention: Thefe
Trees having been planth (0 thick before, they
Wanted but a few Piles to be driven between them,-
that they Ihould be thicker, and fironger, and my
Wall would be foon finifh'd.

So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Caa
bles, and every Thing I could think of to make it
firong; having in it {even little Holes, about as
big as 1 might put my Arm out at: In the Infide
of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and.
Walking upon it 5 and through the {even Holes, I
contriv'd to plant the Mul'quets, of which I took
Notice, that lgot {even on Shore out of the Ship 3
thefe , I lay, I planted as Cannon , and fitted
them into Frames that llcld them like a Carriage,
that {o I could fire all the {even Guns in two Mi-
nutes time: This \Vail I was manya weary Month
a finiihing, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till- it
was done.

When this was done, I {luck all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as
full with Stakes or Sticks of the Ofier-like Wood,
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well
fland 5 infomuch, that I believe I might {ct in near

twenty
twenty thoui'and of them, leaving a pretty large
Space'hetwcen them and my Wall, that I might
have room to fee an Enemy, and they might have
no ihelter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer \Vall.

Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or fix Years time I had a \Vood before
my Dwelling, growing (0 monilrous thick and
flrong, that it Was indeed perfectly impaflable;
and no Men of what kind focver, would ever ima-
gine that there was any Thing beyond it, much leis
a Habitation. As for the Way which I propofed to
myfelf to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by fetting two Ladders; one to a Part of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
room to place another Ladder upon that, {0 when
the tWo Ladders were taken down, no Man living
could come down to me without migchicfing him-
felf; and if they had come dOwn, they were {till
on the Out-{ids of my outer Wall.

' hus 1 trick all the Meafures human Prudence
could fuggelt for my own Prefervation; and it will
be teen at length, that they were not altogether
without juttRcal'on; though I forefaw nothing at
that Time, more than my mere Fear fuggefied to
me.

While-th is was doing, I was not altogether care-
lefs of my other Affairs 5 for I had a great Concern
upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only a prel'ent Supply to me upon every Occa-
' fion, and began to be fuflicient to me, without the
Expence of Powder and Shot; but alfo without the
Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones 3 and I was
loth to lofe the Advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurfe up over again. .

To this Purpofe, after long Confideration, I
couki think of but tWo Ways to preferve them 5

one=.'--- _..._ a." --.-___ . .V

t m]

one was to find another convenient Place to dig a?
Cave under Ground, and to drive them into it every
Night 5 and the other was to e'nclofe two or three
little Bits of Land, remote from one. another, and as'
much conceal'd as I could, where I' might keep a-
bout halF a Dozen young Goats in each Place : So'
that if any Difafier happen'd to the Flock in gene-'
ral, I might be able to raife them again with little'
'Trouble and Time: And this, tho' it Would re-
quire a great deal of Time and Labour, I thought
'was the mol't rational Defign.

Accordingly I {pent fome Time to find out the
moft retir'd Parts of the Ifland 3 and I pitch'd up-
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wifh for; it was alittle damp Piece of Ground
in the middle of the Hollow and thick Woods,
where, as is obferv'd, I almofl loft myfelf once be-
fore, endeavouring to come back that Way from
the Eafiern Part of the Ifland: HereI found a clear
Piece of Land near three Acres, {0 furrounded with
Woods, that it was almoft an Enclofure by N ature,
at leafi it did not want near fo much Labour to

fijmake it fo, as the other Pieces of Ground I had

"i'iiflork'd {0 hard at. .

" 'fv'ie'i'Ef'immediately went to work with this Piece of
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time, I had
{0 fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
which you pleafe, who were mm ['0 wild now as at
fir-It they might be fuppofed to be, were well e-'
nough fecur'd in it. So without any farther De;
Jay, I removed ten young She~Goats and two He-
Goats to this Piece; and when they were there, I
continu'd to perfeet the Fence till I had made it
as fecure as the other, which, however, I did at
more Leifure, and it took me up more Time by a

great deal.

x,

All
All this Labour I was at the Expence of, pnrely'
from any Apprehenfions on the Accdunt ofthe Print
of a Man's Foot which I had fee'n ; for as yet I
never faw any humane Creature 'come near the
Ifland, and I had now liv'd two Years under their:
Uneaiinefl'es, which indeed made my Life much lefs
comfortable than it was before; as may well be
imagin'd by any who know what it is to liVe in
the conflant Snare of the Rear (f Man 3 and this I
muit obferve with Grief t00, that the Difcomp'o-
fure of my Mind had too great Impreflions alfo up-
on the religious Part of my. Thoughts,- for the Dread
and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages
and Canibals lay {0 upon my Spirits, that I {eldon'l
found my {elf in a due Temper for Application to
my Maker, at leait not with the fedate Calmnefs
and Refignation of Soul which I was wont to do; I
rather pray'd to God as under great Aflii&ion and
Prefl'ure of Mind, furrounded with Danger, and in
Expee'tation every Night of being mnrder'd and de--v
vout'd before Morning; and Imufl; teflify from my
Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankfulnefs,
Love and Affeetion, is much the more proper Frame: -
for Prayer than that of Terror and Difcompofure ,-
and that under the Dread of Mifchief impending,
a Man is no more fit for a comforting Performance"
of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Re~
pentance on a Sick-bed: For thefe Difcom'pol'urea
alieet the Mind as the others do the Body ,- and the
Difcompoi'ure of the Mind muft neceflarily be as
great a Difability asthat of the Body, and much
greater, praying to God being properly an A61: of
the Mind, nor. of the Body. '

But to go on ; After I had thus {ecur'd one Part.
of my little living Stock, 1 went about the whole

Ifland, [earching for another private Place, to rank;
.uc.
inch anozher Depofit; when wandring more to the
I/Vefl Point of the Illand than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought Ifaw a Boat up
on the Sea, at a great Difiance; I had found a Pro-
fp'ee'tive-Glafs, or two, in one of the Seamen's
Chelts, which I fav'd out of our "Ships 5 but I had
it not about me, and this was {0 remote, that I c0uld
not tell What to make of it; though I look'd at it
-till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any
longer; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not
know ; but as Idefcended from, the Hill, I could '
'fee no more of it, {o I gave it over; only Irefolv'd
to go no more out without a Profpeetive~Glafs in
my Pocket. "

When I was come down the Hill, to the End of '
the Illand, where indeed I had never been before, '
.I was prefently conv'inc'd, that the feeing the Print
of a Man's Foot, was not fuch a {trange Thing in

t the Illand as I imagin'd y; and but that it was a {pc-
"' cial Providence that I was call upon the Side of the
' Ifland, where the Savages never came , I fhould ea-
:fily have known, that nothing was more frequent
than for the Cancer from the Main, when they hap-
pen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to {boot over
to that Side of the Illand for Harbour ; likewife as '
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vic-
tors having taken any Prifoners, would bringt hem
over to this Shore, where, according to their dread<<
fulCultoms, being all Cam'bali, they would kill and
eat them; of which hereafter.
' When I was come down the Hill to the Shore,
as' I laid above, being the S. W Point of the
Ifland, Iwas perfeetly confounded and amaz'd ,- nor
is it polfible for me to exprel's the Horror of my
Mind , at feeing the Shore {pread with Skulls,
Hands, Feet, and other Bones of humane Bodies;

' and. particularly I obl'etv'd a Place where therebhad .
' een 'been a Fire made, and a Circle dug in' the Earth"; .
like a Cockpit," where it is fuppofed the Savage
Wretches had fat 'down to their inhumane Feafiings
upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures. . ..

I was [0 af'tonifh'd with the Sight of thefe Things;
that I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my
{elf from it for a long while; all my Apprehena
fions were buried in the ThOughts of fuch a Pitchfi
. of inhumane,- hellifh Brutality, and the Horror of
the Degeneracy of humane Nature 3 which tho' I
had heard of often, yet I never had fo near a View
of before ; in fllbrt, I turned away my Face from?
the horrid Spectacle 5 my Stomach grew fick,' and
I was full at the Point of Fainting; when Nature
difcharg'd the Diforder from my Stomach 5 and ha:-
iiing vomited with an uncommonViolence, I was
a little reliev'd ; but could not bear to {lay in the
Place a Moment; {'0 I gatme up the Hill again;
With all the Speed I could, and walk'd o'n t0wards" '
g'ny ovlm Habitation; " , . , . 3 _ .
. When I 'came a little out of that Part of the
Ifland; Illood fl-ill a while as amaz'd ; and then re?
.coverin'g my felf; I Icok'd up with the utmofi Afl'ec'i
tion of tiny Soul, and with a FIOOd of T ears' in my
Eyes,' gave God Thanks that had call my firfl Lot;
in a Part of the World, where I was dil'tinguiflx'd
from fuch dreadful Creatures as thefe; and that
tho' I had el'ceem'd my prefent Condition Very mi~
ferable, had yet given me fo many Comforts in it,-
that I had [till more to giite Thanks for than to"
complain of g and this above all, that I had even hi
this miferable Condition been comforted with the
Knowledge of himfelf, and the Hope of his Ble'fe'
finnghich was a Felicity more than fufiiciently
equivalent to all the Milery Which Ih'ad futiet'd; 01:
Could fuifer;

o a fin
l In this Frame of Thankfulnefs, I went Home to
my Cafile, and began to be much eafier now, as to
the Safety of my Circumfiances, than ever I was"
before; for I obferv'd that thefe Wretches never
came to this Ifland tin (catch of what they could
get ; perhaps not feeking, not wanting, or not ex--
'peeting any Thing here; and having often, no _
doubt, been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, -_
without finding any Thing to their Purpofe. I knew
I had been here now almol'c eighteen Years, and ne-
ver law the leaft Foor--iieps of humane Creature
there before ; and I' might be here eighteen more
as entirely conceal'd as I was now, if I did not diJ- -
cover my felf to them, which I had no manner of
'Occafion to do, it being my only Bufinefs to keep .
my {elf entirely concealed where I was, unlefs-I ;
, found a better fort of Creatures than Cam'bal: to Z
make my {elf known to. '

Yet I entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the Sa'
vage Wretches, that I have been {peaking of, and j
of the wretched inhumane Cuftom of their devour-- -
ing and eating one another up, that I continu'd pen~ Z
five, and fad, and kept clofe within my own Circlfi.
for almofi two Years after this: When I fay my- '-
own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations, .
via. my Cafile, my Country Seat, which I. call'd .
my Bower, and my Enclofiire in the Woods; nor "
did I look after this for any other Ufe than as an =
Enclofnre for my Goats; for the Averfion which ,_
Nature gave me 'to thefe helliih Wretches was "
fuch, that I was Fearful of feeing them, as of feeingfi-
the Devil himfelf; nor did I [0 much as go to look
after my Boat in all this time; but began rather a
to think of making me another; for I could not
think of ever making any more Attempts, to bring , '.
the other Boat round- the'Illand to me , lelt Is;

ihould meet with form: of thefe Creatures at Sea, '|
4 in
in which, if I had happen'd to have fallen into their
Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.
Time however, and the Satisfafiion I had, that
Iwas in no Danger of being difcovered by thefe
People, began to wear off my Uneafinefs about
them; andI began to live juft in the fame compOs'd
Manner as before 5 only with this Difference, that
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes more a--

i

' bout me than I did before, left I {hould happen to '

be feen by any of them; and particularly, I was
more cautious of firing my Gun, left any of them
being on the Ifland, fhould happen to hear of it ;

. and it was therefore a very good Providence to me,

that I had furniih'd my {elf with a tame Breed of
Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the

i Woods, or {hoot at them ; and if I did catch any
of them after this, it was by Traps, and Snares,

as I had done before 5 {0 that for two Years after .
this, I believe [I never fir'd my Gun once ofi', tho' I
never went out withoutit; and which was more, as

I had {av'd three Piitols out of the Ship, Ialways
carried them out with me, or at leafi two of them,

. flicking them in my Goat-Skin Belt ; alfo I furbifli'd
'Dp'bnf of the great Cutlafhes, that I had out'of the

'Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on alfo 3 [0 that
Iwas n0w a mofl: formidable Fellow to look at,

' when I Went abroad, if' you 'add to the fOrmer De-

fcripti'on' of my, felf, the 'Earticula'r of two Piflol's,
and a great broad Sword hanging at my Side in a
Belt, but-without a' Scabbard.

T hings'going on thus, as I have faid, for fome
Time; I fee'm'd,' excepting thefe Cautions, to be
reduC'd to my former calm fedate way of Living,
all'thefe Things tendedto {hewing me more and
more how far my Condition was from being mife--

"able, compared to fome Others; nay, to many 0-

ther Particulars of Life, which it might have plea-
O 3 " fed
{ed God to have made my Lot. It put me upon
reflecting, how little repining there would be
among Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if Peo:
ple would rather compare their Condition with
thofe that are viiorIe, in order to be thankful, than
be a1ways comparing them With thoIe which are
better, to 2111111: their MurmurIngs and Compla1'ne -
1ngs.
bAs 1n my prefent Condition there were not real1y
many Things which I wanted; Io indeed I thought
that the Frights I had been in about thefe Iavage
_ VVretches, and the Concern I had been in for my
- own .I'refervation, had taken 011' the Edge of my In~
yention for my own Conveniences; and I had drop '-d
' a good Def Cr11 Much I had once bent my Thoughts
'too much upon ? and that was, to try if I could'a not 1
'_rna1<e {ome of my Barley into Malt, and then try
to biew my {elf Iome Beer: This viias really a whim '
fical T 11011 ht, and I reprov '-d my {elf often for the
Simplicity gof it , for I preIently {aw there would
be the want of feveralp Things neceIIary to the
rnaking my Beer, that 1t Would be impoffibie EUR01;
Zme' to I11pp1y:As FirPc', Casks to preferve it in;
which was a T 11111 that as I have obferv 'd alreae
dy, I could never comp afs; %: tho I Ip'ent nor
' many Day 3', but WeeksP, nay Months in attempt~
111g1t, but to no 11rp01e. In the next Place, I had
110 Hops to make t keep, no Yeafl to make 1t work,
no Copper or Kettle to make it boil 1 and yet alI
theIe Things, netwithfianding, I verily believe, had
hOt the'fe Things inter'Ven ',d I mean the Frights andfig;
Terrors" I was in about the Savages, I had under:
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pafs too , fofl
, Ieldom gave any Thing over without accomplifhing'

1t, when Ionce had 1t 1'11 'me Head enough to begin
I$tu. . ":-a

hut;But my Invention now run quite another Way 5.
for Night and Day I could think of nothing but.
how I might deftroy forne ofthefe Monflers in their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if'poflible, fave
the Victim they fh'ould bring hither to del'troy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
. Workis intended to be, to fer down all the Contri~
vances I hatch'd, or rather .brooded upon in. my
Thought, for the deltroying thefe Creatures, ' or at
leait [righting them, {0 as to prevent their coming
' hither anymore; but all was abortive, nothing
could be polfible to take Effect, unlel's I was to be
there to do it my {elf ; and what, could one Man
do among them, when perhaps there might~ be-
twenty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with-which they
,could fhoot as true to a Mark, as I could with my,
.Gun? ' . . .
. Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the '
Place Where they made their Fire, and put in five-
or fix Pounds of Gun-powder, which when they
kindled their Fire, would confequently take Fire,
_ and NOW up all that was near it; but as inthe firfl:
Place I lhould be very loth-to wait lb much-Powder-
,upon them, my St '= e being now within the Qum-
tity of one Barrel-315' o.neither,coul,d'l'be fure of its
going off, at any certain time, when it mighvfur-e
prize-Phem, and at bed, that it would do little more.
than lllltblow the Fire about their Ears andlfr-ight
them, but not fufiicient to make them forfake- the
Place; {0 I laid it afide, and then propos'd, that
I would place my {elf in Ambufli, in fome-con~
'venient Place, with my, three Guns, a'llidouble
loaded ,- and in the middle of their bloody Cere-' '
mon)' let fly at them , when I filould be {ure tokill
, _0r Wound perhaps two or three at every {hoot; and
thgn falling in upon them with my three, Piflols,
' ' ' O 4 ' ' andand my Sword, I made no doubt but that if there
was twenty I ihould kill them all. This Fancy
pleas'd my Thoughts for fome Weeks, and I was
{0 full- of it, that I often dream'd of it ,~ and {ome-
times, that I was full going to let fly at them in my
Sleep.

I went [0 far with it in my Imagination, thatI
employ'd my {elf feveral Days to find out proper
Places to put my {elf in Ambufcade, as I faid, to
watch for them ; and I went frequently to the Place
it felf, which was now grown more familiar to me ;
and efpecially while my Mind was thus fill'd with
Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody putting
twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I may-
call it; the Horror I had at the Place, and at the
Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring one
another, abated my Malice. 4

Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of the
Hill, whereI was fatisfy'd I might fecurely wait,
till I" law any of their Boats 'coming,'and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
Shore, convey my {elfunfeen into T hickets of T tees,
in one of which there was a Hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely ; and where I might fit, and
obferve all their bloody Doings, and take my full
aim at their Heads,"When they were {0 clofe toge~
ther, as that it would be next to impoflible that I
fliould mifs my Shoot, 'or that I could fail wound~
ing' three or four of them at the firlt Shoot.

" In" this Place then I refolved to fix my Defign,
and accordingly! prepar'd tw'o Muskets and my
Ordinary Fowling~piece. The two Muskets I
loaded with a Brace of Slugs each; and four or five
fmaller- Bullets,'_ about the Size of Piftol Bullets;
and tlieFowling--piece I loaded with near a Hand-.
ful-of Swan--(hot; 'of the largeft Size 5 I alfo loaded
my Pifids with about four Bullets each, and in this
'- Pofiurc,[-7.01 ].

Poiture, well provided with Ammunition for a fee
cond and third Charge, 1 prepar'd my {elf for my
Expedition.

After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign,
and in my Imagination put it in Practice, Iconti--
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top of the Hill, which was from my Cafile, as I.
call'd it, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I
could obferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
the Ifland, or Pcanding over towards it 5 burl be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two'
or three Months conflantly kept my Watch 5 but
came always back without any Difcovery, there
having not in all that Time been the leaft Appear-
ance, not only on, or near the Shore ; but not on
the whole Ocean, {0 far as my Eyes or Glafles could
reach every Way.

As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, {o long alfo I kept up the Vigour of
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the
while in a fuitable Form, for {o outragious an Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,-
for an Ol'fence which I had not at all entred into at
_ Difcuflion of in my Thoughts, any further than my
Paflions were at firfi: fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd
at the unnatural Cufiom of that People of the Conn-t
try, who it feems had been fuflbr'd by Providence,
in his wife Difpofition 'of the World, to have no
other Guide than that of their own abominable and
vitiated Paflions 5 and confequently were left, and
perhaps had been {0; for fome Ages, to aet fuch-
horrid Things ,. and .receive fuch dreadful Cu-
fioms, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd
of Heaven, and aaed by fome hellifh Degeneracy,
could have run them into: But now when, as I
have (aid, I began to be weary of the fruitlefs Ex--
curfion which I. had madelo long, and [0 far, eve~'

ry[, 2'02. ]
ry Morning in vain, {0 my Opinion of the Action
'it'felf began to alter, and I began with cooler and
calmer Thoughts to confider what it was I Was go-
ing toengage in. What Authority or Call I had,
'to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe-
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for {0 many Ages to fufi'er, unpuniih'd, tovgo on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners of his Judg-
ments one upon another. How far thefe People
were Offenders againfi me, and what Right I had
.to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they
filed promifcuoufly one upon another. I debated
this very often with my felf thus; How do I know
what God himfelf judges in this particular Cafe ? it
is certain thefe People do not commit~ this as a
Crime 5 it is not againll their own Confciences re-
proving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an'Ofl'ence', and then commit
it in Defiance of divine Juilice, as we do in almofi,
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
. to kill an Ox; nor to eat humane Flefh, than we do

. .to eat Mutton. ' I ' ' '

' When I had confider'd :this a little, it follow'd nee
,cefIarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in it ;
that thefe People were not Murderers in the Senl'e
that I had before condemned them in my Thoughts;
any more than thol'e Chrifiians were Murderers, who
often put to Death the Prifoners' taken in Battle;
or more frequently, upon many Occafions, put
whole Troops of Men to the Sword, without git
ving Quarter, tho' they threw down their Arms
and fubmitted. '

In the next Place it occur'd me, that albeit the
Ufage they thus gave One another was thus brutilh
and inhumane; yet it was really nothing to me:
T hefe People had done me no Injury. T hat if they
" " ' ' attempted, l 203* l ' {

attempted me, or I faw it neeefl'ary for my imme-j

:diate Prefervation to fall upon them , {om'ething'

might be laid for it 5 but that as I was yet out of
their Power, and they had really no Knowledge of"
me, and confequently no Defign-upon me ; and there?
fore it could not be jult for me to fall upon them.

That this would jufiify the Conduct ofthc Spaniards

in all their Barbarities praetis'd in America, where

they defiroy'd Millions of thefe PeOple, who,>>how-
ever they were ldolarers and Barbarians, and had {ea
veral bloody and barbarous Rites in their Cu-ftoms,

fuel: as facrificing humane Bodies to their"Idols,_
were yet, 3311) the Spaniards, very innocent People ;

and that the rooting them out of the Country, is
{poken of with the ntmolt Abhorrenee and'De'teftaE

tion, by even the Spaniards themfelves, at this Time,

and 'by all other Chriltian Nations of Europe, as a

mere Butchery, a bloody and unnatural Piece of
Cruelty, unjultifiable either to God or Man 5 and

fueh, as for which the very Name of a Spaniard is

reckon'd to be frightful and terrible to all People of
Humanity, or of Chriltian Compaflion: As if the
Kingdom of Spain'were particularly Eminent for
the Produet of a Race of Men, who were without
Principles of Tendernefs, or the cemmon Bowels of
Pity to the Milerable, which is reckon'd to be a

Mark of generous Temper in the Mind. ' '

' T hefe Co'nfiderations really put me to a Paufe

and to a kind ol'a full Stop ; and I began by little

and little to be OPE of my Defign, and to conclude, I

had taken wrong Meafures in my Refolutions' to at--

tack the Savages; that it was nor my Bufinefs to

meddle with them, unlefs they firlt attack'd me, and

this it was my Bulinel's if poflible to prevent ,- but

that ifI were difeover'd, and attaek'd, then I knew

wyDMn ""' "' '

Qt- . [ 2.04 :1 .

On' the other hand, I argu'd with my felt, That}
this really, was the waynor to deliver my felf, but
entirely to ruin and deftroy my {elf 5 for unlefs l was
{ure to kill every one that: not only ihould be on
Shore at that Time, but that fhould ever come on
Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, to tell
.-- their Country People what had happen'd,they would
come over again' by T houfands to revenge the
Death of their Fellows, and I ihould only bring up'
on my fell? a certain Deflruetion, which at prefent
I had'no manner of Occafion for.

Upon the whole I concluded, that neither in
Principles nor in Policy, I ought one Way or other
to concern my {elf in this Affair. That my Bufinefs
was by all polfible Means to conceal my {elf from
them, and not to leave the leaft Signal to them to
guefs by, that there were any living Creatures upon
the Ifland 5 I mean of humane Shape.

Religion join'd in' with this Prudential, and I was
convinc d now many Ways, that Iwas perfeGdy out
of my 'Duty, when I was laying all my bloody
Schemes for the Deflruetion of innocent Creatures,
I mean innocent as to me : As to the crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them ; they were national, and l ought
to leave them to the Jufiice of God, right) is the G05
vernour of Nations, and knows how by national
Puniihments to make a juft Retribution for national
'Offences 5 and to bring publick Judgments upon
thofe who offend in a publick Manner, by inch
Ways as belt pleafes him. . z .. .

.. This appear'd {0 clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater Satisfafiion toime, than that I had
not been fuffer'd to do a Thing which I now law
{0 much Reafo'n to believe would have been no his
a Sin, than that of wilful Murder, iffl had. cont-

. ' mitted'mitted it; and I gave molt humble Thanks on my
Knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
Blood-guiltinefs; befeeching him to grant me the
Protection of his Providence, that I might not fall
into the Hands of the Barbarians; or that I might
. not lay my Hands upon them, unlefs I had a more
clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my;
own Life.

In this Difpofition I continued for near a. Year
' after this; and [0 far was I fromdefiring an Oc-
cafion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all
"that Time I never once went up the Hill to fee
whether there were any of them in Sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on. Shore
there, or not, that Imight not be tempted to re;
new any of my Contrivances againfl: them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which mi ht prefent it
{elf to fall upon them; only this I di , I went and
removed my Boat, which I had on the other, Side
the Ifland, and carried it down to the Eajf-End of
the whole Ifland, where I ran it into a' little Cove
which I found under fome high Rocks, and where
I knew, by reafon of the Currents, the Savages
durft not, at leafi would not come with their Boats,
upon any Account whatfoevcr.

With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, tho' not neceflary
for the bare going thither, wiz. A Maft and Sail
whichI had made for her, and a. Thing like an An--_
chor, but indeed which could not be call'd either
Anchor or Grapling; however, it was the befll
could make of its kind : All thefe I removed, that
there might n0t be the leaf: Shadow of any Difco-
very, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of any
humane Habitation upon the Ifland.

Befides this, I kept my felt, as I faid, more re-
tired than ever, and feldom went from my Cell,ho--

that than upon my confiant Employment, via. To'
milk my She-Goats, and manage my little Flock, in
the Wood, which, as it was quite 6n the other Part
of the Ifland, was quite out of Danger; for certain
it is, that thefe favage People, who fometimes
haunted this Iflandmever came with any Thoughts
of finding any Thing here, and c011feq11e11tly never
jivandred off from the Coait; and I doubt not; but
they might have been {everal Times 011 Shore, after
my Apprehenfions of them had made me cautiOus'
as well as before 5 and indeed, I look' d back with
{ome Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Con-
dition would have. been, if I had chop' d upon them,
and been difcovered bef6re that, when naked and
unarm 'd, except with one Gun, and that loaden of-
ten only with {mall Shot, I walk 'd every where
peeping, and peeping about the Ifland, to fee what'
I could get; what a Surprize fhould I have been 1n5
if when I difcover 'd the Print of a Man 3 Foot, I-
'had infiead of that .feen fifteen or twenty Savages;
and found them purfuing me, and by the Swiftnefs'
of their Running, no Poflibility of my efcaping
them.

The Thoughts of this [ometimes funk my very
Soul within me, and diftrefs 'd my Mind fo much,:
that I could not {con recover it, to think what I-
fliould haVe done, and how I not only {hould not
have been able to refift them, but even fhould not-
have had Prefence of Mind enough to do what I
might have done; much lefs, what now after fo
much Confiderati6n and Preparation I might be
able to do: Indeed, after ferious thinking of th'efe'
Things, I {hould be very Melancholy, and {ome-
times it would laft a great while; but I refolv'd it
at lafl; all into Thankfulnefs to that Providence;
which had delivered me 110m fo many unfeen Dan-
gets, and had kept me from- thofe Mifchiefs which"

5L 1 I could"[ 7-07 J a . , ,
Icould no way have been the Agent in delivering
my felf from; becaufe I had not the leafle Notion
of any fuch Thing depending, or the leait Suppo--
firion of it being poflible. '

This renew'd a Contemplation, which often had
come to my Thoughts in former Time, when firfl:
I began to fee the merciful Difpofitions of Heaven,
in the Dangers we run through in this Life. How
Wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know no"-
thing of it. How when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hefitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, a fecret Hint ihall dire&
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way;
nay, when Senfe, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Bufinefs has call'd to go the other Way, yet a flrange
Impreflion upon the Mind, from we know not what
Springs, and by we know not what Power, lhall
over-rule us to go this Way ; and it fliall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that Way which we ihould.
have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to
have gone, we ihould have been ruin'd and loft :
Upon thefe, and many like Refleetions , I after'
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when-
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or Preflings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre<<
fented; or to going this Way, or that Way, I never
fail'd to obey the fecret Dictate ; though I knew no
other Reafon for it, than that fuch a Preifure, or
fuch a Hint hung upon my Mind : I could give mat-
ny Examples of the Succefs of this Conduct in the
Courfe of my Life ; but more efpecially in the lat-
ter Partof my inhabiting this unhappy Iiland ; be~
(ides many Occafions which it is very likely I might
have taken Notice of, if I had feen with the fame
Eyes then, that Ifaw with now: But 'tis never too
late to be wife ; and I cannot but advife all confi-
dering Men, whofe Lives are attended with fuch ex-

traordinary
traordinary Incidents as mine, or even though not
fo extraordinary, not to flight fuch fecret Intima-f
tions of Providence, let them come from what invilie
ble Intelligence they. will, that I {hall not difCufs,
and perhaps cannot account for ; but certainly they
are a Proof of the Converfe of Spirits, and the fe-
cret Communication between thofe embody'd, and
thofe unembody'd; and fuch a Proof as can never
be withfiood : Of which I'fhall have occafion to
give fome very remarkable Infiances, in the Re-
mainder of my folitary Refidence in this difmal
Place. - .

I believe the Reader of this will not think
firange, if I confefs that thefe Anxieties, thele con-
I'cant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that was
now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to
all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future

, Accommodations and Conveniencies. I had the

Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands, than

, that of my Food. I car'd n0t to drive a Nail, or

chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noife I
ihould make fhould be heard; much lefs would I
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon 5 and above all, I
was intolerably uneafy at' making any Fire , left the
Smoak, which is vilible at a great Dii'tance in the
Day, fhould betray me 5 and for this Reafon I re--
mov'd that Part of my Bufinefs which requir'd Fire,
fuch as burning of Pots and Pipes, (We. into my
new Apartment in the Woods, where after I had
been fome Time,I found, to my unfpeakable Confo-

.lation, a mere natural Cave in the Earth, which

went in a vafl way, and where, I dare fay, no Sa-
vage had been at the Mouth of it, would be fo har-
dy as to venture in, nor indeed would any Man
elfe ; but one who, like me, wanted nothing [0 much
as a fafe Retreat.

{The[209 l.

The Mouth of this Hollow was at, the Bottom

of a great Rock, where, by mere Accident (I
would fay, if I did not fee abundant Reafon to a-
fcribe all fuch Things now to Providence) I was
cutting down fome thick Branches of Trees, to
make Charcoal ; and before I go on, I mufi obferve-
the Reafon of my making this Charcoal 5 which
was thus :
, I was afraid of making a Smoak about my Ha:
bitation, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live
there without baking-my Bread, cooking my Meat,
('92. [0 I contriv'd to burn fome Wood here, as I
had feen done-in England under Turf, till it became
Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the Fire out,
I preferv'd the Coal to carry Home, and perform
the other Services which Fire was wanting for at
Home, without Danger of Smoak. '

But this by the by. While I was cutting down
fome Wood here, I perceiv'd that behind a very.
thick Branch of low Brufh-wood, or Under-wood,
there was a kind of hollow Place ; I was curious to
look into it, and getting with Difficulty into the
Mouth of it, -I found it was pretty large, that is to
fay, fuflicient for me to fiand upright in it, and per-
haps another with me ; butI mult confefs to you; I -
made more Haile out than I did in, when looking
further into the Place, and which was perfefily
dark, Ifaw two broad {hining Eyes of fome Crea-
ture, whether Devil or Man, I knew not, which
twinkled like two StarS, the dim Light from the'
Cave's Mouth {hining direaly in, and making the -
Reflection. ,

However, after fome Paufe, I recover'd my felf,
and began to call my felf a thoufand Fools, and
tell my felf, that he that Was afraid to fee the De.
- vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Ifland all

alone; and that Idurfi to believe there was no---
~ P ' thingl 21.0 3
thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my .
felt'; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up
a great Firebrand, and in I rufh'd again, with the
Stick flaming in my Hand; I had not gone three
Steps in, but I was a'lmolt as much frighted as I was
before ; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a
Man in fome Pain, and it was follow'd by a broken
'Noife, as if of Words half exprefs'd, and then a l
deep Sigh again: I fiep'd back, and was, indeed,
{truck with'fuch a Surprize, that it put me into a
cold Sweat ; and if I had had a Hat on my Head,
I will not anfwertfor it, that my Hair might not
have lifted it OPE. But flill plucking up my Spirits
33 well as I could, and encouraging. my {elf a little,
with confidering that the Power and Prefence of
God was every where, and was able to proteet me;
' upon this I fiep'd' forward again, and by the Light
of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my
Head, I {aw lying on the Ground a mofl: monfirous
frightful old He-goat, jufi making his Will, as We
fay, and gafping for Life, and dying indeed of mere
old Age. .

Ifiir'd him a little, to fee if I could get him out,
and he efl'ay'd to get up, but was not able to raife
himfelf ,3. and I thought with my felf, he might even
lie there ; for if he had frighted me [0, he would
certainly fright any of the Savages, if any of them
{honld be {0 hardy as to come in there, while he
had any Life in him. '

I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the Cave was
but very finall, that is to fay, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei~
tlier rounder fquare, no Hands having ever been
e'mploy'd in making it, but thofe of mere Nature:
I obferv'd alfo, that there was a Place at the fur-
ther Side of it, that went in further, but wait {0
l. ' ,w,[21.1. Cl

low, that it requir'd me to'creep upon my Hands:
and Knees to go. into it, and whither I went I knew
not; fo having no Candle, I gave it over for fome
Time ; but refolv'd to come again the next Day
provided with Candles, and a Tinder--box, which
I had made of the Lock of one of the Muskets,
with fome Wild-fire in the Pan.

Accordingly, the next Day I came provided with
fix large Candles of my own making ,- for I made
very good Candles now of Goat's Tallow; and go--
ing into this low Place, I was oblig'd to creep upon
all Fours, as I have laid, almofl ten Yards ; which,
by the way, I thought Was a Venture bold enough,
confidering that I knew not how far it might go,
nor what was beyond it. When I was got through
the Strait, Ifound the Roof rofe higher up, I be~
lieve near twenty Foot; but never was fuch a glo~
rious Sight Ram in the Ifland, I dare fay, as it was,
to look round the Sides and Roof of this Vault or
Cave ,- the Walls reflected a hundred thoufand
Lights to me from my two Candles; what it was in
the Rock, whether Diamonds, or any other preci--
ous Sto'nes, or Gold, which I rather fuppos'd it to
be, I knew not. '

The _Place I was in, was a molt delightful Ca.-
vityyor'Grotto, of its kind, 'as could be expected,
though perfealy dark ; the Floor was dry and
level, and had a fort of {mail loofe Gravel upon
it, fo that there was no naufeous or venomous
Creature to be feen, neither was there any Damp
or Wet On the Sides or Roof : The only Difficul-
ty in it was the Entrance, which, however, as it
was a Place of Security, and fuch a Retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience; ('0
that I-was really rejoic'd at the Difcovery, and re-
folv'd, without any Delay, to bring fome of thofe

Things which I was molt anxious about to this
P 2 Place 5

p[222] ~*!

Place; particularly, I refolv'd to bring hither my
Magazine of Powder, and all my fp are Arms, <<viz.
Two Fowling--Pieces, (for I had three in all) and
three Muskets, (for of them I had eight in all,

I kept at my Caftle only five, which Pcood ready 1
moupnted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmoff

- Fence , and were ready alfo to take out upon any
Expedition.

Upon this Occafion of removing my Ammuni~
tion, Itook Occafion to open the Barrel of Pow-
der which I took up out of the sea, and which had
been wet 5 and I found that the Water had pene-
trated about three or four Inches into the Powder
on every Side, which caking and growing hard, had
preferv' d the infide like a Kernel 111 a Shell; fo that
I had near fixty Pounds of very good Powder 1n the
Centre of the Cask, and this was an agreeable Dif-
coveiy to me at that Time, fo I carry d all away
thither, never keeping above two or three Pounds
of Powder with me in my Cal'tle, for fear ofa Sur-
prize of any Kind: I alfo carry 'd thither all the

'Lead 1 had left for Bullets.

I fanCy'd my felf now like one of the ancient Gi~
ants, which were faid to live in Caves and Holes
in the Rocks, where none could come at them , for
I perfuaded my (elf, while I was here, if five hun-
dred Savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out , or if they did, they would not ven-'
ture to attack me here.

a The old Goat, who I found expiring dy'd in
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made
_ this Difcoveiy; and I found it much eafier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover
him with Earth, than to drag him out: So I
interr'd him there, to prevent Offence to my Nofe

dence in this Ifland, and was (0 naturaliz'd to the
Place, and to the Manner of Living, that could
Ihave but enjoy'd the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the Place to difiurb me, I could
have been content to have capitulated for fpending
the reft of my Time there, even to the lal'c Mo-
ment, till lhad laid me down and dy'd, like the old
Goat in the Cave. I had alfo arriv'd to fome little
Diverfions and Amufements, which made the Time
pafs more pleafantly with me a great deal, than
it did before; as firft, I had taught my Poll, as I
:noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo familiarly,' -
and talk'd fo articulately and plain, that it was
very pleafant to me : and he liv'd with me no le'fs
than fix and twenty, Years. How long he might
live afterwards, I know not; tho' I know they
have a Notion in' the Bra/22C/, that they live a bun-
dred Years ; perhaps poor Pod may be alive there
fiill, calling after Poor Roein Crufie t9 this Day. I
with no Englzjbman the ill Luck to come there. and
hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant
and loving Companion to me for no lefs than fix-
teen Years of my Time, and then dy'd of mere '
old Age 3 as for my Cats, they multiply'd, as I have
obferv'd, to that Degree, that 'I was oblig'd to {boot
feveral of them at firlt, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I_ had; but at length, when the
two old ones, I brought with me, were gone, and .
after fome Time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provilion with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or three.
Favourites, which I kept tame ; and whofe Young,
when they had any, [always drown'd; and thefe
were Part of my Family. Befides thefe, I always

kept two or three houfhold Kids about me, which I
P 3 taught. I 2'1 4'1 ,

taught'to feed outof my Hand; and I had two
more Parrots which t'allt'd pretty well, and would all -
call Roein Crufie, but none like my firft 3 nor, indeed,
did I take the Pains with any of them that I had
done With him. 1 had alfo feveral tame Sea-FOWIS,
- whofe Names I know not, who I caught upon the
Shore, and cut their Wings; and the little Stakes
which I had planted before my Came-Wall being
now grown up to a good thick Grove, thefe F owls all
liv'd among thefe low Trees, and bred there, which
was very agreeable to me 3 (0 that, as I' {aid above,
I began to be very well contented with the Life I
led, if it might but have been fecur'd from the
Dread of the Savages. .

But it was otherwife direeted 5 and it may not be
amifs for all. People who {hall meet with my Story,
to make this juft Obferva-tion from it, via. How
frequently, in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil
which in itfelf we feek molt to fliun, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the molt dreadful to us,
is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our Deli-v
verance, by which alone we can be rais'd again from
the Affliction we are fallen into.. I could give many

. Examples of this in the Courfe of my unaccountable
Life'; but in nothing was it more particularly re-
markable thanxin the Circuml'tances of my lal't Year's
folitary Refidence in this Illand.

It was now the Month of December, as I (did a-
bove, in my twenty-third Year ; and this being the
Ifouthern Solftice, for Winter I cannot call it, was
the particular Time of my Harvefl, and requir'd
my being pretty much abroad in the Fields; when
going out pretty early in the Morning, even before
it was thorow Day-light,'I was {nrpriz'd with fee-
jng a Light of fome Fire upon the Shore, at a Di--'
{lance from me, of about two Miles, towards the
End'flo'f the Ifland, where I had obierv'd fome Sa- '

' -- ._ r v'agesL 215-3-

vages had been, as before, but not on the other
Side 5 but, to my great Affliction, it was on my
Side of the Ifland.

I was, indeed, terribly furptiz'd at the Sight, and .
fiep'd {hort within my Grove, not daring to go '
out, lefiI might be furpriz'd; and yet I had no
more Peace within, from the Apprehenfionsl had,
that if thefe Savages, in rambling over the Ifland,
fhould find my Corn fianding, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements, they would immediate-
ly conclude, that there were Pe0ple in the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
me out : In this Extremity I went back ditefily to ~
myCaltle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and made
all Ehings without look as wild and natural as I
couI . .

' Then I prepar'd my felf within, putting my felf
in a Poiiure of Defence 3 I loaded all my Cannon,
as I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which
were mounted upon my new Fortification, and all
my Pifiols, and refolv'd to defend my {elf to the
lafi Gafp, not forgetting ferionfly to commend my
{elf to the divine Proteetion, and earnePcly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Bar"
barians ; and in this Poitnre I continu'd about two
Hours, but began to be mighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I had no Spies to fend out.

Afterfitting a while longer, and mufing what I
ihould do in this Cafe, I was not able to bear fit-
ting in Ignorance any longer,- fo letting up my
Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a
flat Place, as I obferv'd before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me, I fet it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hill 5 and pulling out
my Profpee'cive-Glafs, which I had taken on Pur-
pofe, I laid me down flat on my Belly_on the
Ground, and began to look for the Place. I pre-

P 4 . ' fentlyfently found there was no lefs than nine naked 83.4
'Vages fitting round a {mall Fire, they had made, not
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the,
Weather being extream hor; but, as 1 fuppos'd, to
dre'fs fome of their barbarous Diet of humane F lefli,
which they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead, I could not know. ,
' They had two Canoe: with them,'which they had
haled up upon the Shore ; and as it was. then Tide
of Ebb, they feem'd to me to wait for the Return
of the Flood, to go away again; it is not eafy to
imagine what Confufion this Sight put me into,
efpecially feeing them come on my Side the Ifland,
and lb near me too; but when I obferv'd their
coming mull; be always with the Current of the Ebb,
I began afterwards to be more fedate in my Mind,
being {atisfy'dthat I might go abroad with Safety
all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if they were
not on Shore before : And having made this Ob-
fervation, Iwent abroad about my Harvefi Work
with the more Compofure. "
As I expected, {0 it prov'd ; for as {con as the,
Tide made. to the Weftward, I faw them all take.
Boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away :
I ibould have obferv'd, that for an' Hour and more
before they went off, they went to dancing, and I
could eafily difcern their Pofiures and Geitures by
my Glaffes: Icould not perceive, by my niceit Ob--
fervation, but that they were flark naked, and had
not the leaf: Covering upon them 5 but whether they
were Men or Women, that 1 could not diftinguifh.
As foon as I {aw them {hip'd and gone, I took _
two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Piflols at
my Girdle, and my great Sword by my Side, with
but a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able
to make, Iwent away to the Hill, where I had dif-
' ' covcr'd[ 217 ] _ .
cover'd the firli Appearance of. all ; and asifoon as
I gat thither, which was not lefs than two Hours,
(for I could not go apace, being [0 loaden with Arms .
as I was) I perceiv'd there had been three Canoe:
more of Savages on that,...Place; and looking out
further, I {aw they were all at Sea together, making
over for the Main. . , . ' N

This was a dreadful Si'ght to me, efpecially when
going down to the Shore', I could fee the Marks of
Horror which the difmal Work they had been about .
had left behind it, rvz'z. The Blood, the Bones, and .
Part of the Flefh of humane Bodies, eaten and de-.
vour'd by thofe Wretches, with Merriment and
Sport: I was fo fill'd with Indignation at the Sight,
that I began now to premeditate the Deflruetion of
the next that I'faw there, let them be who or how
many foever. ; - '

It feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which
they thusmake to this Ifland, are not very frequent;
for it wasabove' fifteen Months before any more of
themXcame on Shore there again ; that is to fay, I
neither [aw them, or any Footiieps, or Signals of' 7
them," in, all that Time; for as to the rainy Sea--
fons, then they are fure not to come abroad, at
leaft not _fo far 5 yet all this while I liv'd uncomfort-
ably, by reafon of the conftant Apprehenfions I was
in of their coming upon me by Surprize; from
whenceI obferve, that the Expefi'ation of Evil is
more bitter than the Sufiering, efpecially if there is
noRoom to {bake off that Expectation, or thofe
Apprehenfions. . '

During all this Time, I was in the." murdering
Humour 5 and took up mofl' of my Hours, which
ihould have been better employ'd in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them the Very
nexti'I'ime I fliould fee them; efpecially, if they
thould be divided, as they'were the Iafl: Time, in~ .

t0DIVZIg 1..-

to two Parties; nor did I confide'r at all, that if I
kill'd one Party, fuppofe Ten or a Dozen, I was Rill
the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill another,
and f0 another, even ad infinitam, till I {hould be at
length no lefs a Murderer than they were in being
Man-eaters, and perhaps much more fo.

I {pent my Days now in great Perplexity and
Anxiety of Mind, expecting that I lhould one Day
or other fall into the Hands of thefe mercilefs Crea-
tures; and if I did at any Time venture abroad, it
was not without looking round me with the great-
efl: Care and Caution imaginable; and now I found
to my great Comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for
I durPt not, upon any Account, fire my Gun, efpe~
cially near that Side of the Ifland where they ul'u--
ally came, left I ihould alarm the SaVages; and
if they had fled from me now, Iwas fare to have
them come back again, with perhaps two or three
hundred Canoe: with them in a few Days, and then
I knew what to expect.

However, I wore out a Year and three Months
more, before I ever {aw any more of the Savages,
and thenI found them again, as I'ihall foon obferve.
It is true, they might have been there once or twice;
but either they made no Stay, or at leafi, I did not
hear them 3 but in the Month of May, as near as I
could calculate, and in my four and twentieth Year,
I had a very {trange Encounter with them, of. which

in its Place.

' The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fif-
teen or fixt'een Months Interval, was very great;
I flept unquiet, dreamt always frightful Dreams,
and often Prarted out of my Sleep in the Night: In
the Day great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind,
and in the Night I dreamt often of killing the

Savages,
Savages, and of the Reafbns why I might jufiify
the doing of it : But to wave all this for awhile,
it was on the Middle of May, on the {ixteenth Day'
I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar would ,
reckon ; for I mark'd all upon the Poll: flill ; I fay,
it was on the fixteenth of Ala}, that it blew a very
great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great deal of
Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul Night it
was after it: I know not what was the particular
Occafion of it; ,but as I was reading in the Bible,
and taken up with very ferious Thoughts about my
prefent Condition, I was futptiz'd with a. Noife of
a Gun, as I thought, fit'd at Sea. _

'T his was to be fure a Surprize of a quite difFe~
rent Nature from any I had met with before 3 for
the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite
of another kind. I flatted up in the greatefl: Halle-
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the
middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd it after me,
and mounting "it' the {econd Time, got to the Top
of the Hill, the very Moment that a Flalh of Fire
bid me liPcen for a fecond Gun, which accordingly,
in about half a Minute, Iheard, and by the Sound
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea Where I
was driven down the Current in my Boat.

I immediately confider'd that this mul'c be fome
Ship in Difirels, and that they had fome Comrade,
or fome Other Ship in Company, and fir'd thefe Guns
for Signals of Diltrel's, and to obtain Help: Ihad
this Prefence of Mind at that Minute, as to think
that though I could not help them, it may be they
might help me 5 [0 I brought together all the
dry WoodI could get at hand, and making a good
handfome Pile, I fer it on Fire upon the Hill; the
'x-Vood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and though the
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out 5 that
iwas certain, if there was any fuch Thing as a.

Ship,[(2.20 J] '. .
Ship, they mufl: needs fee it, and no doubt they did ,5

for as foon as ever my- Fire blaz'd up, I heard ano.
ther Gun, and after that feveral others, all from the

i .- fame (barter. I ply'd my Fire all Night long, till

Day broke. ; and when it was broad Day, and the
Air clear'd up, I {aw fomething at a great Difiance
" at Sea, full Eafl of the lfland, whether a Sail, or a
Hull, I could not difiinguifh, no not with my Glaf-
fes, the Dii'cance was {0 great, and the Weather
.ii-ill {omething hazy alfo 5 at leafl: it was {0 out
at Sea. ~

I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and {con
perceiv'd that it did nor move ; [0 I prefently con-
cluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor; and being
eager, you may be fure, to-be fatisfy'd, Itook my
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the Sautb--Eafl
Side of the Ifland, to the Rocks where I had
formerly been carry'd away with the Current, and
getting up there, the Weather by this Time being
perfectly clear, I- could plainly fee, to my great Sor-
row, the Wreck of a Ship calt away in the Night,
upon thofe concealed Rocks which I found when I
was out in my Boat 5 and which Rocks, as they
check'd the Violence of the Stream, and made a
kind of Counter-Stream or Eddy, were the Occa-
fion of my recovering from the mofi: defperate hope-
lefs Condition that ever I had been in in all my Life.
- Thus, what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's

' . Deltruetion 3 for it feems thefe Men, whoever they

were , being out of their Knowledge, and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven
upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at
E. and E.N,E. Had they feen the Ifland, as Imufl:
neceflarily fuppofe they did not, they mul'c, as I.
thought, have endeavour'd to have fav'd themfelves
on Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing
of Guns for Help, efpecially when they faw, as I

imagin'd,imagin'd, my Fire, fill'd me. with many Thoughts;
Firfl I" imagin'd, that upon feeing my Light, they
might have put themfelves into their Boat, and
have endeavour'd to make the Shore 3 but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been cafl:
away; other times I imagin'd, that they might
have loft their Boat before, as might be the Cafe
many ways; as particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their. Ship, which 'many times obli~
ces Men to Rave , or take in Pieces their Boat ; and
fometimes to throw it over Board with their Own
Hands: Other times I imagin'd, they had fome
other Ship or Ships in Company, who, upon the
Signals of Difirefs they had made, had taken them
up, and carry'd them off: Other whiles I fancy'd,
they were all gone oflr' to Sea in their Boat, and
being hurry'd away by the Current that I had been
formerly in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean, ,
where therewas nothing but Mifery and Periihingj;
and that perhaps they might by this .Time think of
Starving, and of being in a Condition to eat one
another. ' .

As all thefe were but Conjectures at beii, {o in the
Condition I was in, I could do no more than look
on upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and pity
them, which had fiill this good Efl'eet on my Side,
that it gave me' more and more Caufe to ive
Thanks to God, who had {o happily and com ort-
ably provided for me in my defolate Condition 3 and
that of two Ships Companies who were now caR:
away upon this Part of the World, not one Life
{hould be fpat'd but mine: I learn'd here again to '
obferve, that it is very rare that the. Providence of
God cafis us into any Condition of Life fo low, or
any Mifery {0 great, but we may fee {omething or
Other to be thankful for; and-may fee others in.
'worfe Circumiiances than our own. S h

Such certainly was the Cafe of thefe Men, of
whom I could not fo much as'fee- Room to [up
pofe any of them were fav'd; nothing c0nld make
it rational, fog much as to wifh or expect that they
did not all perifli there, except the Poflibility only
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com-
pany 5 and this was but mere Poflibility indeed 5 for
I {aw not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any
fuel: Thing: ' i

I cannot explain, by any pollible Energy of Words,
what a i'trange Longing or Hankering of Defires I
felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out {ome-
times thus 5 O that there had been but one or two;
nay, or but one Soul fav'd out of this Ship, to have
efcap'd to me, that [might but have had one Com-
panion, one Fellow-Creature to have fpoken to me,
and to have convers'd with! In all the Time of my
folitary Life, I never felt {o earnelt, {o firong a De-
fire after the Society of my F chow-Creatures, or fo
deep a Regret at the Want of it. ' '

There are fome fecret moving Springs in the Af--
fe8tions, which when they are fer a going by fome
.Objce't in View, or be it fome Object, though not
in, View, yet render'd prefent to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the
Soul by its Impetuofity to fuch violent eager Em~
bracings of the Object, that the Abfence of it is
infupportable.

Slich were thefe earnefl Wifhings, That but one
Man had been fav'd I 0 tbat- it bad eeen but 033 ! I
believe I repeated the Words , 0 that it bad been eut
One! a thoufand Times ; and the Defires were {0
- mov'd by it, that when I 'fpoke the>> Words, my
Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers prefs
,the Palms of'zny Hands, that if I had had any {oft
Thing in my Hand, it would have crufh'd it invo-
'1nntarily 5 and my Teethin my Head would {trike

_ together, '
together, and fet ag'ainit one another {0 {ti-orig,
that for fome Time I could not part them again.
Let the Na'turalifts explain thefe Things, and
the Reafon and Manner of them 5 all I can fay to
them is, to defcribe the F act, which was even {ur-
prifing to me when I found it ; tho' I knew not from
what it ihould proceed, it was doubtlefs the Efl'eet
of ardent Wifhes, and of firong Ideas form'd in my
Mind, realizing the Comfort which the Converfa-

tion of one of my Fellow-Chrifiians would have
been to "me.

But it was not to be; either their Fate, or mine,
or borh, forbid it 5 for till the laft Year of my be-
ing on this Ifland, I never knew whether any were
fav'd out of that Ship or no ; and had only the Af-
fliEURti0n fome Days after, to fee the Corps of a
drown'd Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
Ifland, which was next the Shipwreck: He had on
no Cloaths, but a Seaman's Waitcoat, a Pair ofopen--
knee'd Linnen' Drawers, and a blew Linnen Shirt;
but nothing to direet me .fo much as to gueis what
Nation he was of : He had nothing in his Pocket
but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobacco~Pipe ; the
gaffe} was to me of ten times more Value than the

r .

It was now calm, andI had a great Mind to
venture out in my' Boat to this Wreck,- not doubt--
ing but I might find fomething on Board, that
might be ufeful to me ; but that did not altogether
prefs me {0 much, as the Poflibility that there
might be yet fome living Creature on board, whofe
Life I might not only fave, but might, by {aving
that Life, comfort my own to the lafl. Degree;
and this Thought clung fo to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet, Night nor Day, but I muit
- venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck ; and ,
committing the reit to God's Providence, I thouglhn '

tie
the Impreflion was fo flrong upon my Mind, that
'it could not be refified, that it mull come from
fome invifible Direction, and that I {hould be wan-5
ting to myfelf, if I did not go.

Under the Power of this Impreflion, I hafien'd
back to my Cafile, prepar'd every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great For
' for frelh Water, a Compafs to fleet by, a Bottle of
Rum; forI had {till a great deal of that left; a
Basket full of Raifins: And thus loading my'felf
'with every Thing necefl'ary, I Went down to my
Boat, got the Water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my Cargo in her, and then went Home
. again for more; my fecond Cargo was a great Bag
full of Rice, the Umbrella, to let up over my Head
for Shade, another large Pot full of frefh Water,
and about two Dozen of my [mail Loaves, or
Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's Milk, and a Cheefe 5 all which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my Boat; and
praying toGod to direet my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the Canoe along the Shore,
I came at laft t0 the utmofl: Point of the Ifland
on that Side, (viz) N. E. And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to venture. I look'd on the rapid Currents which
ran confiantly on both Sides of the Ifland, at a.
' Difiance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fail me; for I
'forefaw that if I was driven into eithcrof thofe
Currents, I {hould be carry'd a vaft Way out to
Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach,' or Sight of
the Illand again ; and that then," as my Boat was

but (mall, if any little Gale of Wind ihould rife, I
mould be inevitably loft.

There._ . [7-25] .
. Thefe Thoughts fo Opprefs'd my Mind, that I

began to give over my Enterprize, and having ha--
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I
fiept out, and fate me downiupon a little tiling
Bit of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between
Fear and Defire about my Voyage; when,as Iwas
mufing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd
and the Flood came on, upon which my going was
for To many Hours impraeticable. Upon this
prefently it Occur'd to me, that I fhould go up 'to
the highefl: Piece of Ground I .could 'find, and ob".
ferve, if I could, how the Sets of the .Tide onCtzr--r
. rents. lay, when the Flood came in, thatI might
judge whether, if I was driven one Way out,.I might
nOt expect to be driven an'orher "Way Home, with
the fame Rapidnefs of the Currents : This
Thought was no fooner in my Head, but I call: my
Eye upon a little Hill, which fufficiently- over>>
Icok'd the Sea both Ways, and fromwhen'ce I had
a clear View of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide,
and which Way I was to guide my {elf inmy Re-i
turn ; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
.fet out'c'lofe. by the South Point of the Ifland, fo
the Current of the Flood {et' in sclofe by the ShOre
of the North Side, and that I had nothing to 'do
but to keep to the North of the Ifland'in'my Re
turn, and Ifhould do well enough. * . . ' _
Encourag'd with this Obfervation, I refolv'dthe
next Morning to {et out with the firli; of the Tide ;
and repofing my {elf for the Night in the Canoe,-
under the great Watch--coat I mention'd, I launch'd
out : I made firfl: a little out to Sea full North, till
I began tofeel the Benefit of the Current, which-{ct
EaRWard, and which carry'd me at a great Rate,
and yet .did not {0 hurry me' as the Southern Side
Current had done before, and (0 as to take from
me all Government of the Boat ,- but having a

Q . _ llrongfiroirg Stee'ra'ge with my Paddle, I went..'at '2 great
Rate, direaly for the Wreck, and in leis than two .
Hours I came up to it.' ' '

It was a difmal Sight to 'look at : The Ship,
which by it's Building' was Spam/b, {tuck falt,
jaumid in between two Rocks ; all the Stern and.

. Qiarter ofi-her was beaten to Pieces with. the Sea 5 .
and as her ForeCaitle, which {tuck in the Rocks,
had run on with great Violence, her Mainmail and
Foremait were'brought by the Board 3 that is to
fay, broken {hort off ; but her Boltfprit was found,
and the Head and Bow appear'd. firm; when I
came cloi'e toh'er, a Dog appear'd upon her, who.
feeing me coming, yelp'd 'and cry'd, and as foon
as I cal-I'd him, jump'dz'into the Sea, to come to
me, and I' took him 'into the Boat, but found him.
almoi'c'dead for Hunger and Thirfi : I gave him a
Cake of my Bread, and he eat. it like a ravenous
Wolf, that had been fiarving a Fortnight in the
Snow : 'I then gave thelpoor Creature 'fome freih
Water, with which, if I would have let him, he
wohld have burl} himfelf. a
~, After this 'I'went on Board ;' but the firi'c Sight
I met with, was two Men droWn'd in-the Cook-
Room, or F orecafile of. the Ships. with their Arms
fal'c'about one another : I concluded, as is indeed
probable, that when the Ship firuck, it being in a
Storni, 'the Sea broke 'fo high, and {o continually
over. her, thatthe Men were not able to bear it,
and were flrangled with the conflant rufhing' in of

i the Water, as much as if they had been under War
ter. 'Befides' the Dog, there Wasnothing left in
theShip that had Life, nor any" G'Oods "that _I
could fee, but what were fpoil'd by .<< the Water.
There were fome Casks of Liquor, ' whether Wine
or Brandy, I knew not, which lay 10wer in the

_ Hold ; andwhich, the Water being ebb'd .ontslcl1

' . . , couEould fee' I; but they were too big to meddle with :
I {aw fevera-l Chefts, which I believ?d belongfdt'o
Tome of theSeamen, and, I got two .of_ them into
the Boat, "Without examining what was inthem.
Had-the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and the
Forepart broken off, I am perfuaded I might have
made a good'Voyage ;.for by what I found in thefe >
two Chefis, I .had Room to fuppofe the Ship had
'agreat deal of Wealth on. Board,- and ,ifI may

as we -had'- at the Brafil: ;- and-'in'a'WOrd, not at

found feveral Things of great Ufeftome: For
Example, I fo'u'nd in once. fine Cafe 'of Bottles, of
an extraordinary Kind, and fill'd with Cordial Wa--
ters, fine, and very good 5 the Bottles held about
three Pints each, and were tip'd with Silver: I
- found two Pots of very good Succades, or Sweet-
meats, {o faiten'd alfo on Top, that the Salt Water
had "not hurt them 5 and two more of the fame,
-wh~ich- the Water hadfpoil'd : I found fomle very
'-good' Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and
'a-bout a dozen and a half of Linnen white Handker-
chiefs, and colour'd Neckcloths ; the former were
' 'alfo very welcome, being exceedingrefrefhing to

great Bagsof Pieces of Eight, which held about
'eleven' hundred Pieces in all ; and in: one of them,
wrapt up-in a Paper, fix DoubIOOns .of Gold, and
fome {mall Bars or Wedges of Gold ; I [uppofe they

fine glaz'd Powder, in three- {mall Flasks, kept, I
{uppofq for charging their F owling-pieces, on Qt:-
cafion: Upon the whole, I "got very-little bythis
. Voyage, that was'bf any Ufe to- me"; for as tothe
Money, I had no Manner of Occafion for it ;- 'twas
'to me as the Dirt under, my Eeet; and I'would
'have given it all for three 0r 'fourPair 'of Englifi
Shoes and Stockings, which were ThingsI greatly
wanted, but had not had, on my Feet now for
many-Years: I had, indeed, gotten two Pair .of

Shoes now, which I took oil" of the Feet of the
twoE 229 1

two d1own'd Men, who I {aw in the Wreck; and
I found tWo Pair more in one of the Chefls, Which
were very welcome to me , but they were not like
our Eaglrjb Shoes, either for Eafe or Service, being

rather what we call Pumps than Shoes. I found
in this Seaman's Chefi about fifty Pieces of Eight
. in Royals, but no Gold, I {up pofe this belong'd
to a poorer Man than the Other, which feem'id to'
belong to Tome Officer. .
Well, however, I lagged this Money home to
my Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which I brought from our own Ship , but it was great
Pity, as I (aid, that the Other Part of this Ship had
not come to my Share, for I am fatisly 'd I might'
- have loaded m'y Canoe {everal Times over with Mo-
ney, which, if I had ever efcap'd to England, would _
have lain here fate enough till I m1ght have come

again and fetch'd 1t.
' Having now' brought all my Things on Shore,'
and fecur'd them, I went back to my Boat, and
row'd or paddled her along the Shore to her old
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the belt of
my Way to my old Habitation, where I found
every Thing fafe and quiet, {o I began to repofe
myfelf, live after my old 12111111011, and take Care of
my Family Afl7airs; and for a while, Iliv'd eal'y
enough , only that I was more vigilant than I us d

other Way.

innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl-'d
through that great Th'orowfair of the Brain; the
Memory, in this Nights Time: I run over the
whole Hiflory of my Life in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this

. Ifland; and alfo of the Part of my Life f 11cc I
came to this Ifland. In my Reflee'tions upon the
State of my Cafe, {inee I came on Shore on this

Iflan'd, I 'was comparing the happy Poiture- of my _

_ Affairs, in the PS111 Years of my Habitation here,

compar'd .to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I had Iiv 'd 111 ever fince I had feen the P-rin't of
'11 Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe the
8aVages had frequented the Ifland even all the while,
and might have been {everal Hundreds of them at
Times 'on Shore there, but I had never knoWn it,
and Was incapable of any Apprehenfions' about it';

my Satisfaetion was perfeet, tho' my Danger was

the fame; and I was as happy 1n not knowing my
'Dang er, as if I had never really been expos 'd to it.

This furniih' (I my Thoughts with many very pro-f-
fitable Refleetions, and particularly this one, HOW

"infinitely Good that Providence 13', which has pro:-

none of thefe Thoughts, I fay, fo 'much as came
in my Way ,- but my Mind was Wholly bent upon
the Notion of my pafling over in my Boat to the
"main Land: I look'd back upon my prefent Condi-
tion, as the moit mifetable that could poflibly be;
that I was not able to throw myfelf into any .thing
but Death that could be call'd worfe; that if I
reach'd the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coait along, as Idid
on the Shore of Afi-z'ck, 'till I came to fome inha-

if. the worfe came to the worii, I could but die,
which would put an End to all thefe Miferies at

the Wreck I had been on board of, and where I
had been {'0 near the obtaining what I {o earneflly

ges coming to Land, and that they brOught with
them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in order to eat 'him ; when, on a fudden, the Sa-
vage, that they were going to kill, jump'd away,
and ran for his Life; and I thought in my Sleep,
that he came running into my little thick Grove,
before myFortification, to hide himfelf; and that I,
feeing him alone, and not perceiving that, the other
.fought him that Way, {how'd myfelf to him,

k'neel'd down to me, feeming to pray me to afiifl:
him 5 upon which I lhew'd my Ladder, made him
go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he be-
name my Servant; and that as foon as I had got-
ten this Man, I laid to myfelf, now I may certain-
ly venture to the Main Land; for this Fellow
'will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, and whither to go for Provifions; and whie
ther "not to go for fear of being devour'd, what Pla-
ces to venture into, and what to efcape: I wak'd
{vith this Thought, and was under fuch inexpref--'

ing himfelf a little at Liberty, Nature infpir'd him
with Hopes of Life, and he llarted' away from
them, and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the
Sands direfily towards me, I mean, towards that

I "was dreadfully frighted (that I mull; acknowi-t

There was between them and my Caltle the

with exceeding Strength 'andSwiftn'efs ; when the

i more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that fled from them: It Came
"now very warmly upon my Thoughts; and indeed
irrefifiibly, that how was my Time to get me 3.
Serum, and perhaps a Companion, or Aflifiant:
and that I was cal1' d plainly by Providence to fave
~ this poor Creature' 3 Life; I immediately run down
the Ladders with all poflible Expedition, feteh?d
my two Guns, tor they were both- but at the Foot
1 of the Ladders, as I obferv'd above; and getting
, up again, with the fame Hafie, to the Top of the
Hill, I crofs'd toward the Sea; and having a very
ihott Cut, and all down Hill, clap'd myfelf in
the way, between the Purfue'rs, and the purfu'd,
hollowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
back, was at 11-111 perhaps as much frighted at me
as at them, but I beckon 'd With my Hand to him,
to come back, and 111 the mean Time, I {10wly ad-

Were. I beckon'd him again to come to me, and
gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I
'could think of, and he came nearer and nearer,

of Acknowledgment for my faving his Life: Ifmil'd

"Was more Work to do yet; for I perceiv'd the Sa--

{tun'd with the Blow, and began to come to him-
felf; {o I pointed to him, and {bowing him the Sa---

' vage, that he was not dead; upon this he {poke

fome Words to me, and tho' I could not underfiand
them, yet I thought they were pleafant to hear,
for they were the firPc Sound of a Man's Voice that
I had heard, my own excepted, for- above twenty-five
Years. But there was no Time forfuch Reflec--
tions now; the Savage, who was knock'd down,
recover'd himfelf {0 far,- as to fit up upon the
Ground, and I perceiv'd that my Savage began to
lee-afraid; but when I {aw that, l prefented my
. ' R other

Slave for ever. I t00k him up, and made much of

vage, whom I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but 'l 242- ] ,

other Piece at the Man, as if I would {hoot him";
upon this my Savage, fbr fl) I cafl him now, made a
lVIotion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung"-
naked in a Belt by my Side; {0 I did: He no {con-4'
er had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one
Blow cut off his Head as cleverly, "no Executioner
in Germany could have done it fooner or better;
which I thought very flrange, for one, who I had
reafon to believe, never {aw a Sword in his Life be-
fore, except their own wooden Swords; however,-
.it feems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their
wooden Swords {o fliarp, fo heavy, and the Wood
is fo hard, that they will cut off Heads even With'
them, aye and Arms, and that at one Blow too:
When he had done this, he comes laughing to me
in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword
again, and with abundance of Geflures, which I
did nor underfland, laid it down with the Head of
the Savage, that he had kill'd juit before me.

But that which afionifh'd him molt, was to know~
how I had kill'd the other Indian f0 far 05; lo,
pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let him go
_ to him ; lo I bad him go, as well as Icould 5 when

he came to him, he flood like one amaz'd, looking
at him, turn'd him firfl: on one Side, then on t'other,
look'd at the Wound the Bullet had made, which
it feems was juit in his Breal'c, where it had made a
Hole, and no great Qiantity of Blood had follow'd,
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead:
He took up his Bow and Arrows, and came back,
(0 I tnrn'd to go away, and beckon'd to him to fol-
low me, making Signs to him, that more might come
after them.

Upon this he fign'd to me, that he fllOLlld bury
them with Sand, that they might not be feen by the
tell if they folloW'd; and {o I made Signs again to

him to do in; he fell rework, and in an Inflan: 11;

had Terap'd a Hole in the Sand with his Hands, big
Enough to bury the firlt in, and then drag'd him in-
to it, and cover'd him, and did [0 alfo by the other ;A
Ibelieve he had bury'd them both in a Quarter of
an Hour; then calling him aWay, Icarry'd him, not
to my Came, but quite away to my Cave, on the
farther Part of the Ifland ; [0 I did not let my Dream
come to pafs in that Part, viz. That he came into
my Grove for Shelter.

Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Railinsetg
eat, and a Draught of Water, which Ifoundhe
was indeed in great Dil'trefs for, by his Running;
and having refreih'd him, I made Signs for him to
go lie down and fleep, pointing to a Place where I
had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket
upon it, Which I ufed to fleep upon myfelf fomee'
Itlimes; fo the poor Creature laid down and Went to

eep.

He was a comely handfome Fellow,- perfeetly well
made, with {trait long Limbs, not too large, tall
and well fhap'd ; g and,- as I reckon,- about twenty-fix
Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
- not a fierce and furly Afpeet, but [eem'd to have
fomething' very Manly in his Face, and yet he had
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his
Countenance too,- efpeeially when he fmil'd. His
Hair was long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his
Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity.
and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of
his Skin was not quite black, but Very tawny, and
yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous Tawny, as the
Brafiliam, and Virginians, and other Natiires of
America are, but of a bright kind of a dunOlive
Colour, that had in it fomething very agreeable,
tho' not very eafy to defcribe; His Face was round
and plump; his Nofe (mall, not flat like the Ne-'>>
grow; a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his

13. a fine. , l 244 1 .
fine Teeth well fer, and White as Ivory} After he
had flumber'd, rather than flept, about half an
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave
to me, for I hadtbeen milking my Goats, whichI
had in the Enclofure jufl by: When he efpy'd me,
he came running to me, laying" himfelf down
again upon the Ground, with all the poiiible Signs
, of an humble thankful Difpofition, making a many
antick Geltures to {how it: At laft he lays his
Head flat upon the Ground, clofe to my Foot, and,
fets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done
before; and after this, made all the Signs to me. of
Subjection, Servitude, and Submiflion imaginable,
to' let me know how he would ferve me as- long as
he liv'd. I underfio'od him in many Things, and
let him know I was very well pleas'd with him; in
a little Time I began to {peak to him, and teach,
him to {peak to me,- and firl't, I made him know
his Name fllOI'lld be Friday, which was the DayI
fav'd his Life,- I call'd him To for. the Memory of
the Time 5 I likewife taught him to fay Mafler, and
then let him know that was to be my Name 5~I
likewife taught him tofay Te: and N0, and to know
the Meaning of them; I gave him {omegMilk in an
earthen Pct, and let him fee me drink it'before
him, and lap my Bread in it; and I gave hima
Cake of Bread to 'do the like, which he quickly
comply'd with, and made Signs that it was very.
good ibr him. '

I kept there with him all that Night, but as [con
as it was Day, I beekon'd to him to come with
me, and let him know 'I would give him fome
Cloaths, at which he feem'd- very glad, for he was
{lath--naked: As we'tvent by the Place where he
' had bury'd the two Men, he pointed exaetly to the 1
Place, and PS2:er me the Marks that he had;
made to find them- again, making Signs to IPS11m

that-ure"lhould dig them up again, and eat them;
at this I appear'd very angry, exprefs'd my Ab-
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the -
Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to
him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great Submiflion. I then led him up to the
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone;
and pulling out my Glafs, Ilook'd, and law plain-4

rance of them, or .of their 0412035; {0 that it was
'iplain that they were gone, and had left their two
Comrades behind them, without any Search after
them.

But I was not content with this Difcovery, but
having now more Courage, and confequently more afie-
Curiofity, I took my Man Friday with me, giviig "2
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and" f
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufe.
very dexteroufly, making him carry one Gun for-meg:
and I two for? myfelf, and! away we march'd to the.-
Placc where thefe Creatures had been 5 for I had a'
Mind now to get fome uller Intelligence of them _:.
When -I came to ther lace, my very Blood ran
chill in my Veins, and!r my Heart funk within me
at. the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, at legit it was {0 to me, tho' Friday
made nothing of it; The Place was cover'd with
humane Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flelh left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and fcorch'd 3 and, in fhort, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been
making there, after a Victory over their Enemies,

I faW three Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of
three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other
Part8 of the Bodies ; and Friday, by his Signs, made
me underlland, that they brought over four Pril'oners
PS0, {Wt uponsthat three of them were catch up,
'- _R 3 ' ' and.1:461

and that he, pointing to himfelf, was the fourth;

That there had been a great Battle between them,
and their next King, whofe SubjecSts 1t _feems he had
been one of,- and that they had taken a great Num-
ber of Prifoners, all which were carry'd to fevera'l
Places by thofe that had taken them in the Fight,

in order to feal't upon them, as was done here by '
thefe Wretehes upon thofe they brought hither. 1

I caus'd Fu'day to gather all the Skulls, Bones,
Fleih, and whatever remain ',d and lay them to-
gether on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it, 2'
and burn them all to Aihes: 1 found Friday had {till .
a hankering Stomach after fome of the Flelh, and
was {till a Cannibal 1n his Nature, but I difcover'd
fo much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of 1t, and
at the lealt Appearance of it, that he durft not dif--
eover it; forI had, by {ome Means, let him know,
that I would kill him if he ofFer'd it.

When we had done this we came back to our
Caflle, and there I fell to work for my Man Friday,
and firit of all I gave him a Pair of Linen Drawers,
which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chefl: I men-
~tion 'd, and which I found 1n the Wreck , and which,
with a little Alteration, fitted him very well , then
I made him a Jerkin of Goat 's--skin, as well as my
Skill would allow, and I was now grown _a tolerable
'good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had
made of aHare--skin, very convenient and fafliion-i ,
able enough , and thus he was clqathfld for the
prefent, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleas 'd
to fee himfeli' almoit as well cloath'd as his Mailer:
It 18 true, he went aukwardly 1n thefe Things at firflu
wearing the Drawers was very aukward to him,
and the Sleeves of the Waftcoat'gall'd his Shoulders;
and the infide of his Arms , but a little eafing
them, where he complain d they hurt him, and
5= - . ' ' ' ul'ng_ ufing himfelf to them, at length he took to them
'very well. ' '
The next Day after I came Home to my Hutch
with him, _I began to confider where I ihould lodge
him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be '3
perfectly cafy myfelf, I made a little Tent for him "
'in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
in the Inflde of the lalt, and in the Outfide of the
firfi: And as there was a Door or Entrance there
into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door-cafe,
and a Door to it of Boards, and let it up in the
Pallage, a little within the Entrance; and cauling
the Door to open on the Infide, I bar'd it up in the
Night, taking in my Ladders too; [0 that Friday
could no way come at me in the Infide of my inner-
mofi Wall, without making lo much Noile in getting
rover,'that it mui'c needs waken me ; for my firlt
Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid crofs with
{mallet Sticks infiead of Laths, and then thatch'd
over a great Thicknefs with the Rice Straw, which
was firong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place
which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had
plac'd a kind othap-door, which, if it had been
attempted on the Out-fide, would not have open'd
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great Noife; and as to Weapons, I took them all

in to my Side every Night.

But I needed none of all this Precaution; for
never Man had amore faithful, loving, fincete- Ser--
vant than Friday Was to me; without Palfions,
Sullennefs, or 'Defigns, perfectly oblig'd and en-
'gag'd; his very'Afl'eetions were ty'd' to .me, like
thofe of a Child to a Father; and I dare fay, he
wonld have facrificed his Life for the faving mine,
upon any Qccalion whatfoever; the many T eitimo-

' ' ' R 4 ' nies
nies he gave me of this, put it out of Doubt, and
((1011 conviuc'd me, that I needed to ufe no Precau- '
tions as to my Safety on his Account.
This frequently gave me Occaf on to obferve,
and that with Wonder, that however it had pleas'd
.God 111 his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from {0 great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, the belt Ufes .
to which their Faculties and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted; yet that he has befiowd upon
them the fame Powers, the fame Reafon, the fame
Affeetions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and 1'
Obligation, the fame Paflions and Refentments of:
Wrongs, the fame Senf'e of Gratitude, Sincerity,
F1delity, and all the Capacities of doing Good",
and receiving Good, that he has given to us , and
that when he pleafes to ofler to them Occafions of 5
exerting thefe, they are as read, nay, more ready
to apply them to the right fes for which they';
were beflowfld than we are And this made me :

"might judge by this poor Savage) would make a
much better Ufe of it than we did
" From hence I {ometimes was led too far to in- 11-

count of firming againi't that Light, which, as the
Scripture fays, was a Law to themfelves, and by
' fuch Rules as their Confeiences would acknowledge

make him 11feiul, handy and helpful; but efpecialiy
to make him fpeak, and underfiand me when I
fpake, and' me was the apteii Scholar that ever was,
- and particularly was Io mer1y, {o conflantly diligent,
and To pleas 'd when he could but underfiand me, or

to me to talk to him; and now my Life began to
be fo eafy, that I began to fay to myfelf, that
'could I but have been fafe from more Savages, I
cared not if I was never to remove from the Place
while I liv 'd.

After I had been two or three Days return'd to
my Cal'cle, Ithought, that, in o1der to bring Friday
ofi from his horr1d Way of feeding, and from the
Relifh of a Canibal's Stomach, I ought to let him
tafie other Flefl1 , {o I took him out with me one
Morning to the '.vVoods I went indeed, intending .
to kill a 23Kid out of my own Flock, and bring it
home "and drefs it: But as I was going, I {aw

not to flit, immediately I prefented my Piece. {hot
and kill 'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature,
who had at a Difiance, indeed, feen me kill the
Savage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine, how it was done, was fenfibly furpriz',d
trembled and ihook, and look'd fo amaz'd, that I
thought he would have funk down. He did not fee
the Kid I had {hot at, or perceive I had kill'd it,
but rip 'd up his Waitecoat to feel if he was not
Wounded, and, as I found, prefently thought I was .
refolvid to kill him, for he came and kneel'd down
to me, and embracing my Knees, find a great
many Things I did not underliand, but I could
eafily fee that the Meaning was to p1ay me not to
kill him.

I foon found a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and taking him up by the Hand,
laugh'd at him, and pointing to the Kid which I
had killd, beckon'd to him to run and fetch it, .
Which he did, and while he was wondering and,
looking to Ice how the Creature Was kill'd, I loaded
my Gun again, and by-and-by I {aw a great Fowl
like a Hawk lit upon a Tree within fl1ot;fo, to
let Friday underftand a little what I would do, I
_'call 'd him to me again, pointing at the Fowl, which
was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a
Hawk; I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and to my
Gun, and to the Ground under the Pairot, to let
him fee I would make it fall, I made him 11nder-_
fiand that I would fl'lOOt and kill that Bird; accor-
dingly Ifir'd, and bad him look, and immediately

. he {aw the Parrot fall; he flood like one frighted

again, notwithfianding all I had {aid to him, and I

'iound he was the m01e amaz 'd, betaui'e he did not

"Bealt, "Bird, or '.any thing near or far off,- and the -
Aflonifl'lment this created in him was fuch, as
could'not wear off for a long Time; and I believe,
if I' would have let him, he Would have worlhip'd
me and my Gun: As for the Gun itfelf, he would
not fo much as touch it for feveral Days after; but '
would {peak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an~
fwer'd him, when he was by himfelf ; which, as I
afterwards learn'd of him, was to delire it not to
kill him. .
Well: After his Altonifhment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird
I had ihot, which he did, but flay'd fome Time;
for the ParrOt not being quite dead, was flutter'd
a good way off from the Place where flue fell; how-
ever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to
me ; and, as Ihad perceiv'd his Ignorance about the
Gun before, I took this Advantage to charge the
.Gun again, and not let him. fee me do it, that I
might be ready for any Other Mark that might pre--
fent; but nothing more oifer'd at that Time; {01
brought home the Kid, and the fame Evening I took
the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I could; and
having a Pot for that Purpofe, I boil'd or Rew'd
Tome of the Flefli, and made fomevery good Broth;
and after I had begun to eat fome, I gave fome to
my Man, who feem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it
very well 5 but that which was llrangeft to him, was
to fee me eat Salt with it ,- he made a Sign to me,
that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a
little into his own Mouth, he feem'd to naufeate it,
and would [pit and {putter at it, walhing his Mouth
with frelh Water after it 5 on the other Hand, I took
{ome Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pre--
tended to {pit and {putter for want of Salt, as fall as
he had done at the Salt,- but it would not dos he
"' " " ' ' ' would
, would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in'his" "
Broth; at leait, not a great while, and then but a
very little. -

Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth,
I Was refolv'd to feafi him the next Day with maf-
ting a Piece of the Kid ,- this I did by hanging it
before the Fire in a String, as I had feen many People
do in England, fetting two Poles up, one on each
Side the Fire, and one crofs on the top, and tying
the String to the crofs Stick, letting the Meat turn
Continually: This Friday admir'd very much; but.
when he came to tafie the Fleih, he took lb many
_ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that Icould
nor but underfiand him; and at lafl he told me he
would never eat Man's Flelh any more, which I
was very glad to hear.

The next Day I fet him to work to beating fome
Corn out, and lifting it in the Manner I ufed to do,
as I obferv'd before ; and he foon underflood how to
do it as well as I, efpecially, after he had feen what
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make
Bread of; for after that I let him fee me make my'
Bread, and bake it too 5 and in a little Time Friday
was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I
could do it myfelf.

I began now to confider, that having two Mouths
to feed inftead of one, I mufl provide more Ground
for my Harveii, and plant a larger Quantity of
Corn than I ufed to do ; {o I mark'd out alarger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the fame
Manner as before, in which Friday not only work'd
very willingly and very hard, but did it very
chearfully; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for Corn to make more Bread, becaufc he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for
him and myfelf too: He appeat'd very {enfible of
that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had ,3

much '
C
fiiuch more Labour upon me on his Account; than
I had for myfelf; and that he would. ' work the
harder for me, if I would-tell him what to do.
This was the pleafanteil: Year of all the Life I
led in- this Place: Friday began to talk pretty well,
and underfland the Names of almoi't every thing I
had Occafion to call for, and of every Place I had
to fend him to, and talk a great deal to me ; {0
that, in fliort, I began now to have {ome ufe for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had" very little Oc-
cafion for before; that is to fay, aeout Speech .- Be-
iides the Pleafu're of talking to him, I had a lingu-
lar Satisfafiion in the Fellow himfelf; his fimple"
unfeign'd Honefi'y appear'd to me more and more
every Day, and I began really to love the Creature;
and on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it
was poflible for him ever to love any Thing before.
I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again ,- and having
learn'd him E27324]: {o well, that he could anfwer -
me almofi any (lucfiions, I ask'd him whether the
Nation that he belong'd- . to never conquer'd in
Battle? At which he fmil'di-Eand faid, Yes, yes, we
always fight the better; that, is, he meant always
get the better in Fight 5 and {0 we began the fol-

formerly been among the Savages, who, ufed to'
come on Shore on the farther Part of the Illand, on
the [aid Man--eating Occafions that he Was now
brought for; and fome Time after, when I took the
Courage to carry him to that Side, being the fame
I formerly mention'd, he prefently knew the Place,

twenty Men, two Women, and one Child: He
could, not tell twenty in Englg/b; but he number'd
'- them by laying [0 many Stones in a Row, and
pointing to me to tell them over. _

I have told this Palfage, becaufe it introduces
what follows; that after I had had this Difcourfe
with him, I ask'd him how far it Was from our
Ifland to the Shore, and whether the Ganges were
not often lolt ; he told me there was no Danger,
no Canoes ever loll; but that after a little Way out
to the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind al-

ways one Way in the Morning, the other in the
Afternoon. . .

told me all he knew, with the greatefl: Opennefs
imaginable. I ask'd him the Names of the feveral
Nations of his fort of People, but could get no
' other Name than Carib: ,- from "whence I eafily un-
derflood, that the'fe were the Caribeees, which our
Maps place on the Part of America, which reaches
from the Mouth of the River Oroonooleo to Guiana,
and onwards to St. Martin: : He told me that up a
great Way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond
the letting of the Moon, which mult be 1/7. from
their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men,
like me ; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which
I mention'd before 5 and that they had kill'd marl:
Mam, that was his Word: By all which I. under
flood, he. meant the Spaniards whofe Cruelties in .
America had been .fpread over the whole Countries, '
andswere remember'd by all the Nations from Father
to on. .
. I enquit'd if he could tell me how I might Come .
from this Ifland, ,and get among thofe white Men ;
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go 2'12 two Canoe; I
'could not underfiand what he meant, or make him
defcr'ibe to me what he meant by two Canoe, till at
lafl, with great Difficulty, Ifound he meant it mull:

be in, a large great Boat, as big as two Cancer.
This
This Part of Friday's Difcourfe began to relilli
with me very well, and from this T imeI entertain'd
lome Hopes, that one Time or other, I might find
an Opportunity to make my Efcape from this Place;
and that this poor Savage might be a Means to
help me to do it. '

During the lc'mg Time that Friday has now been
with me, and that he began to {peak to me, and
under-{land me, I wasnot wanting to lay a Fotmda-
tion of religious Knowledge in hisMind 5 particu-
larly, I ask'd him one Time, Who made him?
The poor Creature did not underl'cand me at all,
but thought I had ask'd who waslhis Father: But
I took it by another Handle, and ask'd him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the
Hills and Woods? he told me it was one old Bc~
mmmkee, that liv'd beyond all : He could defcribe
nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was ver)r
old; much older, he faid, than the Sea or the Land,
than the Moon or the Stars: I ask'd him then, if .
this old Perfon had made all Things, why did nor
all Things worlhip him P He look'd very grave, and
with a perfeet Look of Innocence, faid, All Things
faia' 0 to [aim : Iask'd him if the People, who die
in his Country, went away any where? He laid,-
Yes, they all went to Benamuckee: Then I ask'd
. him, Whether thel'e they eat up went thither too?
He laid, Yes.

From thefe Things I began to infirua him in
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, That
the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,
pointing up towards Heaven: That hegoverns
the World by the fame Power and Providence by
which he had made it : That he was Omniporent,
could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to
us, take every Thing from us; and :thus, by de--
grees, I open'd his Eyes. He lilten'd with great fit>>
, -. ' tentxongtention, and receiv'd with Pleafure the Norion of
was Clarifl, being fent to redeem 'us, and of the
Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his
being able to hear us, even into Heaven; He told
me one Day, that if our God could hear us up be4
yond the Sun, he muft needs be a greater God than
their Benamuc/eee, 'who liv'd but a little Way off;
and yet could not hear, 'till they went up to the
great Mountains where he dwelt, to'fpeak to him :
L aslt'd him if ever he went thither to {peak to
him. He faid, No, they never went that were
young Men; none went thither but the old Men,-
who he call'd their Oowokakee, that is, as I jrnade'
him explain it' to me, their Religious, or Clergy,
and that they went to fay 0, ([0 he call'd laying
Prayers) and then came back, and told them what

" Benamuckee laid. By this I obferv'd, That there is,

Prieflcmfi", even amongl't the molt blinded ignorant
Pagans in the World; and the Policy of making a
fecret Religion, in order to preferve the Veneration
of the Pe0ple to the Clergy, is not only to be found
in the Roman, but perhaps among all Religions in

' the World, even among the moii 'brutifh and barba--
r. rous Savages.

'I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud to my
Man Friday, and told him, That the Pretence of
their old Men going up to the Mountains to fay 0
to their God Benamzzckee, was a Cheat, and their
bringing Word from thence what he faid, was
much more {0 5 that if they met with any Anfwer,
or {poke with any one there, it mufi be with an

' evil Spirit: And then I enter'd into a long Dif-

courfe with him about the Devil, the Original of
him, his Rebellion againfl; God, his Enmity to

'Man, the Reafon of it, his letting himfelf up 'in

the dark Parts of the World to be worihip'd inv-

'i'tead of God, and as God; and the many Strataa
S . gems, [ 258 ] - .
gems he made ufe of, to delude Mankind to their
Ruin ; how he had a fecret Accefs to our Pallions,
and to 'our Alfeeti'ons, to adapt his Snares [0 to our
.Inclinations, as to caufc us even to be our own
T empters, and to run upon our Defiru&ion by our'
own Choice.

' I found it was not {0 eafy to imprint right N0"
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God. Nature aflilled all my Argu~
ments to evidence to him even the Neceflity of a
great firlt Caufe and over-ruling governing Power,
a fecret diree'cing Providence, and of the Equity
and Jufiice of paying Homage to him that made .
us, and the like. But there appear'd nothing of all
this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his Oris-
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and above all, of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
fo tOo. And the poor Creature puzzled me once
in {ugh a Manner, by a Queltion meerly natural
and innocent, that I fea'rce knew What to fay to -
him. I had been talking a great deal to him of
the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful
Averfion to Sign, his being a confuming Fire to the
Workers Of Iniquity 5 how, as he had made us all,
he could dellroy us and all the World in a Moment; _
and he lifien'd with great Serioufnefs to me all the
while.

, After this, I had been telling him how the De-
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
uled all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
Defigns of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
of Chrilt in the World, and the like. Well, fays
Friday, but you fay, God is {o firong, fo great,.is
he not much flrong, much might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, fays I, E'iday, God is fironger than the
Devil, God is above the Devil, andtherefore we
pray to God to tread him down under our Fees,

-- an, [ 259 J
and enable .us to refill his Temptations, and quench
his fiery Darts. Bat, {ays he again, if God 'muclz'
firong, mac/2 mtg/2t ow tlze Devil, why God no lei/l the De-'

mil, fl) make him no mare do wit/zed?
I was Pcrangely furpriz'd at his Qpellion,_iand .
after all, tho' I was now an 'old Man, yet lavas; ':
but a young Doctor,- and ill enough qualify'd %r.;

' \sif'!

' a Cafuil'c, or a Solver of Difficulties: And, at liege;
I could not tell what to fay, {o I pretended ndii't'o
hear him, and ask'd him what he (aid? Biit he
was too earnefi for an Anfwer to forget his'Quef-
tion; f0 that he repeated it in the very fame broken
Words, as above.- By this Time I had recovered

' myfelf a little, and I laid, God raid at la/l pang/b
him fiverely; be i5 refirU'a' for the yudgmeat, and 13'
-to be cafl into the Bottomle : Pit, to dual wit/2 ever-
lafliag Ere. This did not fatisfy E--iday, but he re-
turns upon me, repeating my Words, R E s E RV E

Devil now, not lei" great ago? You may as Well ask
me, faia' 1, Why God does not kill you and I,
when we do wicked Things here that ofl'end him;
We are preferv'd to repent and be pardon'd: He
muf'es a while at this; [37211, well, fays he, mighty
affeetionatel y, that well; fl) you, 1, Devil, all wick-
ed, all pro/ewe, repeat, God pardon all. Here .I was
run down again by him to the lalt Degree, and it.
was a Teliimony to me, how the meet Nocions or
Nature, though they will guide reafonable Creae .
tures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor-
{hip or Homage due to the fupreme Being of God, .

Lord and Saviour 3'qu Clm'fl, I mean, the Word
of God, and the Spirit of God, promis'd for the
Guide and Sane'cifier of his People, are the able-
lutely neceflary Infirue'cors of the Souls of Men,
in the {aving Knowledge of God, and the Means of
Salvation. '
I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe be--
tween me and my Man, rifing up hafiily, as upon
fome fudden Occafion of going out; then fending
him for fomething a good Way ofi', I-ferioufly pray'd
to God, that he would enable me to inflruet faving-- -
ly this poor Savage, aflilling by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the
Light of the Knowledge of God in Cbrz'fi, recon-
ciling him to himfelf, and would guide me to fpeak
{o to him from the Word of God, as his Con-fei-
ence might be convinc'd, his Eyes open'd, and his
Soul fav'd. When he came again to me, I enter'd
into a long DifCOurfe with him uponthe Subjeet of
the Redemption of Man by the' Saviour of the
World, and of the Doetrine of the bepel preach'd
from Heaven, ruz'a. of Repentance towards God,
.and Faith in our blefled Lord jefizr. I then ex~
plain'd to him, as well as I could, why our Blefled
Redeemer took nor on him the Nature of Angels,
but the Seed of Abra/Jam, and how. for that Rea-
fon thefallen Angels had no Share in the Redemp-
tion; that he came only to the loll Sheep of the Houfe

Creatures Inflrufiion, and mult acknowledge what
I believe all that aet upon the fame Principle will
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really
inform'd and inl'crueted myfelf in many Things, that
either I did not know, or hadvnot fullyrconfider'd
- ' before;

upon my fearching- into them, for the Information '
of this poor Savage; and Ihad more 'Afieetion in
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occafion, than!
ever Ifelt before; fo that whether thispoor wild
Wrctch was the better for me, or no, I had great
Reafon to be thankful that ever he came to me :
My Grief _ fer lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond Meafure; and
whenI reflected that in this folitary Life which I
had been confin'd to, I had not only been mov'd
myfelf to look up to Heaven, and to' feek to the-
Hand that had brought me there; but was now
to be made an Inllrument under Providence to fave
the Life, and, for oug/at I know, the Soul 'of a poor
Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion, and of the Chrifiian Doctrine, that he
might know Chrifi Jefus, to know whom 2'5 Life eter--

:1 fecret Joy run through every Part of my Soul,
and I frequently rejoic'd that ever I was brought to '
this Place, which I had [0 often thought the moi}~
dreadful of all Afilietions that could poflibly have
befallen me.

In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Re-
mainder of my Time, and the Converfarion which
employ'd the Hours between E-iday and I, was
Inch, as made the three Years which weliv'd there
together perfeetly and compleatly happy, zj'nny furl:
2'72ng as compleat Hap/2mg} can be form'd in a fublu-

a much better than 1 5 though I have Reafon to '
hoPe, and blefs God for it, that we were equally

had here the Word of God to read, and no farther .

not refrain from obferving here alfo from Experi-

After Ride} and I became. more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could underlta'nd almoit all
I laid ,to him, and {peak fluently, though in broken
Englzfl), to me; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at leait {0 much of it as related to my
coming into the Place, how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Myftery, for fuch
it was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and
taught him how to (hoot: I'gave him a Knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, Inch
.as in England we wear Hangers in; and in the Frog,
inltead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, Which
was not only as good a Weapon in {ome Cafes, but
much more tifeful upon other Occafions. .

I defcrib'd to him the Country of Europe, and
particularly England, which Icame from ; how we
liv'd, how we worfliip'd God, how we behav'd to
one another; and how we traded in Ships to all
Parts of the World: I gave him an Account of the
Wreck which I had been on board of, and lhew't'l
him as near as I could the Place where {he lay;
but {he was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.

I ihew'd him the Ruinscof our Boat, which we
loft when we efcap'd, and which I could not [lit
with my whole Strength then, but was now fallen
almoit all to Peices; Upon feeing this Boat, E'iday
flood mufing a great while, and {aid norhings I.
ask'd him what it was he Itudy'd upon; at'lafi, fays
be, me feefuc/J Boat like come to Place at my Nztiozz.

I did not underfiand him a good while; but,at
Jail, when I had examin'd farther into it, I under~

S 4. _ flood .
flood by him, that a Boat, fuel-1 as that had been;
came on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd;
that is, as he explain'd'it, was driven thither by
Strefs of Weather: Iprefently imagin'd, that fomc
European Ship mufi have been cait away upon their
Coait, and the Boat might get loofe, and drive
afhore, but was {0 dull, that I never once thought
of Men making efcape from a Wreck thither, much
lefs whence they might come, [0 Ionly enquird
after a Defcription of the Boat.

Eidzzy defcrib' d the Boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to underfiand him, when he ad-
ded with fame Warmth, wefzzze t/ye tt/Jiz'e Mamfiom
d1 awn Then I prefently ask'd him, if time was any
white Mans, as he call 'd them, in the Boat: Tea,
he (aid, the Boat full (j 'w/aite films: I ask d him how
many, he told upon his Fi11ge1s feventeen ; Iask'd
him then what became of them, he told me they
211119, the} dwell at my Nation.

This put new Thoughts into my Head, fo1I
prefently imagin'd, that thefe might be the Men
belonging to t7the Ship that was cait away in Sight
of my Illand, as I now call it; and who, after the
Ship was i'ciuck on the Rock, and they faw her i11-

evitpably loit, had {av 'd themfelves 1n their Boat, and
were landed upon that wild Shore, among the Sa-
vages.

Upon this, I enquir 'd of him more c1itically
-what was become 01 them, he aflur'd me they
liv'd Ptill there,- that they had been there about
_ four Yeaiss that the Savages let them alone, and

gave them V1etuals to liv.e Iask'd him, how it
c ame to pafs they d1d not kill them and eat them ;
he (aid, M, they make Brat/oer with them; that is,
as I underflood him, a Truce: And then he ad.-
g'ed, The} no em .Mam but when maize the [War figbt :

$119.; is 1:9 fay, they never eat any MenJ-{hut

J
fuch as come to fight with them, and are taken in
Bartel. . ' _

It was after this, fome confiderable Time, that
being on the Top of the Hill, at the Bali fide
of the Ifland, from whence, as I have (aid, I had
in a clear Day difcover'd the Main or Continent
of America ; Friday, the Weather being very ferene,
looks very earnefily towards the main .Land, and
in a kind of Surprize falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at fome Difiancc
from him : I ask'd him what was the Matter; 0
joy ! fays he, 0 Glad I Tlaere fee my Country, there
my Nation!

. I obferv'd an extraordinary Senfe of Pleafure ap-
pear'd in his Fate, and his Eyes fparkled, and his
Countenance .difcover'd a firange Eagernefs, as if
he had a Mind to be in his own Country again;
and this Obfervation .of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made me at firlt not [0
eafy about my new Man Friday. as I was before ;
andI made no Doubt, but that if E'ida} could get
back to his .own Nation again, he would not only
forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to
me 5 and would be forward enough to give his
Countrymen an Account of'me, and come back per-
haps, with a hundred or two of them, and makea
FeaPc upon me, at which he might be as merry as
he ufed to be with thofe of his Enemies, when
they were taken in War.

But I wrong'd the poor honefl Creature very

much, for which I was very forty afterwards,
However, as my Jealoufy increas'd, and held me
fome Weeks, I was a little more circumfpeet, and
not {0 familiar and kind to him as before; in
which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the ho-
nelt grateful Creature having no Thouglmabout it,
but What eonlified with the belt Principles, both

. .45as a religious Chrillian, and as a~ grateful Friend,
as appear'd afterwards to my full Satisfac'iion.

While my Jealoufy of him lalied, you may be
{are I was every Day pumping him to fee if he
would difcoyer any of the new Thoughts, which I
{ufpeeted were inhim; but I found every Thing
he {aid was fo honeft, and fo innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourifh my Sufpicion; and,
in {pite of all my Uneafinefs, he made me at lal't
entirely his own again; nor did he in the leafl per-
ceive that I was uneafy, and therefore I could not
fu-fpeel: him of Deceit, .

One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the
Weather being hazy at Sea, fo that we could not
fee the Continent, Icall'dto him, and (aid, Fri--
day, do not you wifh yourfelf in your own Coun~
try, your own Nation ? Tee, he faid, I be much 0
glad 'to he at my awn Nation. What would you do
there, {aid 1, would you turn wild again, eat Mens
Flelh again, and be a Savage as you were before ?
He look'd full of Concern, and {halting his Head,
faid, No, no; Friday tell them to live good, tell them
to pray God, tell them to eat Com-bread, Cattle-He ,
Mlle, no eat Man again : Why then, faidI to him,
The} will kill you. He look'd grave at that, and
then raid, M, they no kill me, they willing [we learn:
. He meant by this, they would be willing to learn.
He added, they learn'd much of the bearded Mans
that came in the Boat. Then I ask'd him if,_he
would go back to them P He {mil'd at that, and
told me he could not fwim {0 'far. I told him I

would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he
' would go, if I would go with him. I go ! fays I,
why, they will eat me if I come there: No, no,
lays he, me make they no em! you, me maize they much.
[owe you. He meant, he would tell them howl had
kill'd his Enemies, and fav'd his' Life, and [0 he
. . would["267 l '

would make them love me ; then he told me, as
well as he could, how kind they were to feventeen
white Men, or bearded Men, as he call'd them,
who came on Shore there in Dilirefs.

From this Time, I confefs, I had a Mind to
venture over, and fee if I could pollibly join with
thefe bearded Men, who, Imade no doubt, were
Spaniards or Portu ugefe; not doubting but, if I could, '
we might find gfome Method to efcapc from
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good
Company together, better than I could from an
Ifla11d4o Miles off the Shore, and alone Without.
Help. 4So, after fome Days, I took Friday towork
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told himI would
1 give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation ,
. and acco1dingly I carry'd him to my Friga: e,
1 which lay on the other fide of the Ifland, and ha-
ving clear 'd it of Water, for I always kept 1t funk
in the Water, I brought it out, {hew'd it him, and
we both went into it.

I found he was a molbdexnous Fellow at ma--
naging it, would make it go almolt as fwift and
falt again as I could ; f0 when he was in, I laid. to
him, Well, now, Friday, {hall we go to your Na- -'
tion ? He look'd very Jdull at my laying To, which,
it feems, was becaufe he thought the Boat too
{mall to go {0 far. I told him then I had a bigger;
fo the next Day I went to the Place where the
firfi Boat lay which I had made, but which Icould
not get into Water , He {aid that was big enough , '
' but then, as I had taken no (Dam of it, and it had
lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun
had {plit and dry'd it, that it was in a Manner
rotten. Friday told me, fuch a Boat would do ve~
ty well, and would 'carry much enough Mule, Drink,
,Breagi, that was his Way of Talking.

Upon. [ 7.68 ']

~Upon the whole, I was by this Time fo'fix'd' .-
upon my Defign of going over with him to the
Continent, that I told him we would go and make
.one as big as that, and he fliould go home in it.
He anfwer'd not one Word, but look'd very grave
and fad: I ask'd him what was the Matter with-
him ; he ask'd me again thus, Wlay you angry mad ,
wit/J Friday, what are done .? I ask'd. .him What he
meant 5 I told him I was not angry With him at all.
No angry! No angry ! fays-he, repeating the Words
fevetal times, My jam! Friday .laome away to my
Nation .3 Why, fays I, Hiday, .did you not fay you
wifh'd you were there ? 12:5,yer, .fays he, u-z'fl>> be. [wt/1
there, no will) Friday there, no Mafler time. In a. ,
word, he would no: think of going there without
me: I go there, E'ia'ay, fays I, what {hall I do
there .> He turn'd very quick upon me at this: Tau
do great deal mac/2 Good, fays he, you read: wild Mam
be good fuller tame .Mam 5 you tell them Imam God,
pray God, and live new Life. Alas, Friday, lays I,
thou knowefi: not what thou {ay'lt, I am but an
ignorant Man my fell: 273$, yer, .{ays he, you teacbee ,
me Good, you teaebee them Got-d. No, no, Friday,
fays I, you {hall go without me, leave me here to
live by my felt, as I did before. He look'd confus'd
again at that Word, and running to one of the
Hatchets which he us'd to wear, he takes it up '
hafiily, and gives it me 5 what mull I do with this? '
{ays I to him : Tau take kill Friday, fays he : What
mui'c I kill you for ? {aid I again. He returns ve-
ry quick, LIV/mt yoa jemi Friday away for? take kill.
Friday, ao fend Friday away. This he {poke {o
earneftly, that I {aw Tears {land in his Eyes. In
aword, I {o plainly difcover'd the utmoi} Afiefiion

I told him then, and often after, that -I_ would ne--

hay with me. ' Upon _
Upon the whole, as I found by all'his Difcourfe
a fettled Affeaion to me, and that nothing fliould
4 part him from me, {0 I found all the Foundation
of his Defire to go to his own Country, was laid ,
in his ardent Affeetion to the People, and his Hopes
ofimy doing them good; a Thing, which as I had
no Notion of my felf, lo I had nor the leafl: Thouoht
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it. But Eill
Ifound a {trong Inclination to my attempting an
Efcape, as above, founded on the Suppofition ga-
ther'd from the Difcourfe, (<<2122.) That there were
feventeen bearded. Men there, and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and makea
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage.
There were Trees enough in the Ifland to have
built a little Fleet, not of Periagua's and Canoes,
but even of good large Vefl'els, But 'the main Thing
I look'd at, was to get one {0 near the Water that
we might launch it-when it was made, to avoid
the Mii'take I committed at firft. '

At lal't, Friday pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better-than I what Kind of Wood was
fittefi for it; nor can Itell, to this Day, whatWood-
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call Fufiz'c, or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for
a Boate But I fliew'd him how rather to cut it out
with Tools, which after I had fliew'd him how'-
to ufe, he did very handily, and in about a Month's.
hard Labour we finifh'd it, and made it very
handfome, efpecially when with our Axes, which i .
{hew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Qut~fide into thent'rue Shape of a Boat ; after this,

however, it. coi't us near a Fortnight's Time tolgct

. When {he was in the Water, and tho'flie was {'0'
. big, it amaz'd me to fee with what Dexterity and

her, and paddle her along; fo I'ask'd him if he
would, and ifw'e might venture over. in her; Tex, he

knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mait and
' Sail, and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable : As'
, to. a Mal't,that.was eafy enough to get; f0 I pitch'd
upon a flrait young Cedar-Tree, which I found
near the Place, and which there was great Plenty
of in the Ifland; and I [et Friday to Work to cut it
doWn, and gave him Directions how to fliape and
, order it. But as to the Sail,that was my particulat' '
Care ; I knew Ihad old Sails, or rather Pieces of
old Sails enough _; but as I had had them now'
26 Years by me, and had not been very careful.
to preferve them,- nor imagining that I fhould ever=
- 'have this kind of Ufe for them, I did not doubt
I but they were all rotten; and indeed mofi of them
were [0; however, I found two Pieces which ap-
pear'd pretty good, and with thefe'l went to work,
and with a great deal of Pains, and aukwardvxedi-J
ous fiitching (you may be fare) for Want of Needles,
I'at length made a three~corner'd ugly Thing, like"
what we call in England, aIShoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with a Boom at Bottom, and a little
{hort Sprit at the T 0p, fuch as ufually our Ships
Long-Boats fail with, and fuch as I belt knew how"
to manage; becaufe it was fuch aone as I had to
the Boat in whichI made my Efcape from'Bareary;
. as related in the firll Part of my Story; I".
. W25[7-71] _ .

I was hear two Months performing this lafle '
Work, viz. rigging and fitting my Mall and Sails ;
for I finilh'd them very compleat, making a {mall .
Stay, and a Sail, or Forefail to it, to aflift, if we
{hould turn to Windward; and which was more
than all, _ I fix'd. .a. Rudder to the Stern of her, to
{leer with ; and though I was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as I knew the Ufefulnefs, and even
Neceflity of fuch a Thing, I apply'd myfelf with
Io much Pains to 'do it, that at laPc I brought it to
pafs, tho' confidering the many dull Contrivances
I had'for it that fail d, I think itcofi me almofi as
much Labour as making the Boat. '

After all this was , done too, I had my Man.Fri->>
day to teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation
of my Boat ; for though he knew very well'how to '
paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing 'what belong'd to
a Sail and a Rudder, and was the mofi amaz'd
when he faw' me work the Boat too and again in
the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd, and
fill'd this. Way or that Way, as. the Courfe we 'fail'd'
chang'd: I fay, when he {aw this, he floodlike
one afionilh'd and amaz'd : However, with a little
Ufe, I made all thefe Things familiar to him ;._.;a'nd
he became an expert Sailor, except that agitate '
Compafs, I could make him underfiand very little
of that. On the Other Hand, as there was very little
cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in '
thofe Parts, there was the lefs Occafion for a Com--
pafs, feeing the Stars were always to beifeen by
Night, and the Shore .by Day, except in the rainy "
Seafoiis, and then noBody cared to ftir abroad, ei-
ther by Land or Sea. . .

Iwas now enter'd on the {even and twentieth
Year 'of my Captivity in this Place ; though the
three lafi Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rather to be, left out of the Account, my Ha-

bitationI 27z I

bitation being' quite of another Kind than'in all the
tell: of the Time. I kept the Anniverfary of my
landing here with the fame Thankfulnefs to God-
,for his Mereies, as at firit; and if I had fuch Caufe
of Acknowledgment at firft, I. had much more fo~
now, having fuch- additional Teliimonies of the
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being effectually and fpeedily deliver'd;
for Ihad an invincible Impreflion upon myThoughts,
that my Deliverance was at Hand, and that I {hould
not be another Year in this Place: However, I went
on with my Husbandry, digging, planting, fencing,
as u'l'ual ; Igatherfd and enr'd my Grapes, and did
every neeeflary' Thing, as before. '

The rainy Seafon was in the meantime upon-
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times ; fo I had fiow'd our new Velfel as fecnreas
we 'could, bringing her up into the Creek, where,
as I (aid, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts {rem
the Ship, and haling- her up- to the Shore, at high
Water Mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little
.-_Do,_'ck, jul't big enough to hold her, and jail: deep
lenoughlto give her Water enough to float in ; and
then, when. the Tide was out, we made a Pctong
Dani crofs the End-of it to keep the Water out 5
and [0 {he lay dry,- as to the Tide, from the Sea;
and to keep the- Rain of}; we laid a great many
Boughs of Trees Io thick, that .flie was as well
thatch'd as a Houfe 5 and thus we waited for' the
Month 'of November and December, in which I (16*
{ign'd to make my Adventure.
.. When the fettled Seafon began to come in, as
"the Thought of my Defign return'd with the fair
Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage;
and the firfi Thing I did, was to lay by a certain
Quantity of Provifions, being the Stores for our
Voyage 5 and intended, in a Week or a' Fortnight's.

Time,
Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boat.
I was bufy one Morning upon lbmething. of this
kind, when/I callid to Friday, and bid him go to the '
Sea Shore, and fee if he could find a Turtle, or
Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got once a
Week, for the Sake of the Izggs, as well as the
Flelh: E-z'day had not been long gone, when he
tame running back, and flew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the
Steps he fet his Feet on 5 and before I had'Time to
fpeak to him, he cries out to me, O Mafler ! OMa-
.fler I. O Sorrow! 0 bad .' What's the Matter, Friday,
fays I 5 O yonder, there, fays he,,ofie, two, three Canoe!
one, two, three! By his way of 'fiieaking -I conclu-
ded there were fix 5 but on Enquiry I found it Was ,
bat three: Well, Friday, fays I, do not be frighted; '
f0 I hearten'd him up {as well as I could : However,
I law the? poor Fellow Was molt terribly fear'd ; for
nothing ran in his Head but that; they Werecome to '
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat
himgiand' the poor Fellow trembled f0, that I
fcarce knew what to;do with him 2 I comforted him -
as Well as I could, and told him I was in as much
Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as
him; but, fays I, E'iday,1ve ma/lrefolm tofigbt them; A
Can you fight,-- Friday? ,Me flmot, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, laid
I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not
kill; fo I alk'd him,'Whether if I refolv'd to defend
him, he would defend me, and {land by me, and do
jul'c as I bid him? He faid, Me die, when you bid die, . .
My)"; fo I Went and fetch'd a good Dram of '
Rum, and gave him, for I had been {'0 good a Huf-
band of myR'um, that I had a great (1981 left:
When he had drank it, Imade him take the' two '-
Fowling-Pieces, which we always carry'd, and load
them with large Swan-Shot, as big as {mall Pifiol
' T Bullets 5
Bullets, then I took four Muflrets, and loaded them

with two Slugs, and five finall Bullets each; and
'my two' Pif'tols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets
- each : I hung my great Sword as ufual, naked by
my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet. .
' When I had thus prepar'd myJ'elf, I' took my Per-
fpee'cive Glals, and went up to the Side of the Hill,
to feewhat I could difcover, and! found quickly,
by; my Glafs, that there were one and twenty Sa-
vages, three Prifoners, and three Canoes, and that
their whole Bufinefs {cem'd to be the triumphant
Banquet upon thefe three human Bodies, (a barba-
rous-Feat}: indeed) but nothing more than as I had
obferv'd was ufual with them;

I obferv'd alfo, that they were landed not where
they had done when Friday made his Efcape, but .I
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and '
where a thick PWood came clofe almol'c down to the
Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
Err'andthelh Wretc'hes came about, fill'd me with
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Friday
and told him, I was refolv'd to go down to them,
and-kill them all -, and afk'd him if he would fiand
by me > He had now gotten over his Fright, and
his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram I had
given him, he was very chearful, and told me, as
before, be would die, when I bid dz' . ' '

In this Fit of Fury, I took firl't and divided the
Arms which I had charg'd, as before, betWeen us :
I gave Friday one Pittol to Rick in his Girdle, and
three 'Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took one Pi-
ftol, and the other three my felf, and in this Po-
fiure we marchid out: I took a f mall Bottle of Rum
in my Pocket, and gave F1 511st a large Bag with
more Powder and Bullet 5 and, as to Orders, 1
charg'd him to keep clofe behind me, and not to
llir, or "met, or do any thing, till I bid'him; and

. m>>[ 2:7 s l
in the mean Time, not't'oTpeak a Word: In this
Poflure I fetch'd a Compafs to my Right Hand of
near a Mile, as well tog'et'ovcr thehCreek, as to
get into the Weed ,' lb that I might come within
Shot ,of them, before I {hould he difcovet'd, which
I had'lee-n by my .G'lafs it was eafy to do.

While I was making this March, my former
Thoughts returning, -I began to abate my Refolu--
tion,' I- do not mean, that I' entertain'd'any-Fear -
of their Number, for as they were naked, unarm'd.
Wretches, 'tis certain I was fiiperiior to them; nay,
though I had>> been alone, hilt it occurr'd to my
Thoughts, What Call? What Occaf'ion~,> -, much
lefs, What Necellity I wasi'n to go and dip my

,Hands in 'BIOOd', to attack People? who ha'dneither-
done or intended the any Wrong? Who, as to me,
were innocent, and whofe'b'arbarous Citfioms Were
their own Difafier, being in them a, Token indeed,
of God's having left them, with the other Nations-
of that Part of the World>>; to fuch Stupidity and
to fuch inhumane (Iourfes; but did not'call me'to
take upon me to be "ajudge of their Aetio'n's, t'n'u'ch
leis an Executioner of his jufiice, that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Cauf'e into his,
own Hands, and by National Vengeance puni'fh
them as a People fer National Crimes -, but that,
in the meantime, it was name of my Bufinefs; that
it was true, Friday might jultify it,'becaufe he was

. a declar'd Enemy, and 'in a State of War with thofe
very particulate People, and it was la-wfitl for him
to attack them, but I could not fay the fame with
relpee't'to me. Thefe Things were f0 warmly
prei's'd upon my Thoughts all the Way as I went,
that I refolv'd I would only go and place myfelf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous
Feed, and that I would a& then as God fhould
direct; but that unlefs 'fomething off'er'd that'was

' ' ' T 2 more.more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would not
meddle'with them. -' . - ' , , . '
With this Refolution I enter'd the Wood, and
withall poilible Warynefs and Silence (Friday fol-
lowing clofe at my; Heels) I marchid till I came'
-- to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was
next to _ them, only that one; Corner of the Wood
lay between me andthemz Here I, call'd foftly to
Eriday, antlfliewing him a great Tree, which was
qut at the Corner of the Wood, I had, him go to
the Tree, and-bring me Word if he could fee there
plainly what they were doing 3 he did? fo, and came
immediately back tome, and told me they might
be plainly view'd. (here, that they were all about
their Fire,-'eating.the,Fle{h of oneof their Prifo-
nets, and that another lay bound hpon the Sand,
a little from them, which he faid- theywould kill
next, and. which fir'd- all. the very Soul within me :
He toldine it was: not one of their Nation. but one.
of the bearded Men, whovhev had told meiof, that.
came to theirCountry in the Boat: I was fill'd
with Horror. at the verynaming the white-bearded
Man, and, going to the Tree, '1 faw plainly,hy my
Glafs, a white Man, who 'lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with
Flags, or Things like Rulhes, and that he was an
European, and had Cloaths on.

, There was another Tree, and. a little Thicket
beyond it, aboutfifty Yards nearer to them than
the Place where I was, which, by going arlittle Way
about, I faw I might. come at undifcover'd, and
that then I. fliould be within half Shot of them 5 f0
Iwith-held my Paflion, though {was indeed en-
rag'd to the higheft Degree, and going back about
twenty Paces, I got behind fome Bullies, which held _
all the Way, till [came to the other Tree; and then

Icame to a little rifing Ground, which gave me a
' - fullfull dView of them, at the Dil'tance of about eighty
Yar s. ' ' ' ' . ~ .

' I had now not .a Moment to lofe, for nineteen
of the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground, all
clofe huddled together, and had juf't fem the other
two to-butcher' the poor Cbrijiz'aiz, and bring him,
perhaps. Limb by Limb to their Fire, and they
were {loop'd down to untie the Bands, athis Feet :
I turn'd to Friday, Now, Friday, faid I, do as I bid
thee; Friday faid he Would, then, Friday, fays I,
do exaetly as you fee me do, fail in nothing; f0. I
fet down one of the Muikets and the Fowling-
Piece upon the Ground, and Friday did the like
by his; and with the other Mulket 'I .took my
Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like -, then
aiking him, If . he was ready? he faid, Yes; then
filri? at them, faid I; and the fame Moment I'firfd
a o. '

Friday took his Aim. fo much better than I, that
on the 'Side that he {hot, he kill'd'tWO of them,
and wounded three more 5. and on any Side, I ki'llkl
one, and wounded two: They were, you may be
fure, in a dreadful'Coni'ternation 5 and allofgthem,
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet,
but did not immediately know which Way torun,
.or which Way to look; for they knew not from
whence their'Del'truetion"*ea1ne: Friday kept his
Eyes clofe upon 'me, that as Ihad :bid him, he
might obf'erve what I did --, f0, as {hen as the firft
Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took

'np the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like, he

fee me cock, .and'prefent, he did the fame again -,
Are you ready? Friday, faid I, yes; 'fays he, let
fly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with
that I fir'd again among the amazdegd Wretches, and
f0 did Friday, and as-our Piece-s were-now loaden
with 'what I call'd Swan-Shot, or finall Pillol-Bul-
' I 3 letsilets, we found only two drop -, but fo many were
wounded, that they ran about yelling and fkr'ean'i-
sing like mad Creatures, all bloody, and 111iferab'ly
, wounded, molt of the1i1, whereof three more fell
'quickly. after, though not quite dead.
1 Now, Eidc'zy, fays I, laying down the difcharg d
' Pieces, 'and taking up the Mulket, which was yet
loaden, follow _,1ne lays I, which he did, with a
great deal of Courage, upon which I rul'n" d out of
the'w' < ad, and fhew (1 my felf, and Eida'y clol'e at
my Foet: As foon as I perceivd they faw me I
ihouted an 1011.1 as lcould, and bad Friday do fo
too, 1111111111111 111111- as I could, which by the.
way was not 1131 y fafl, being loaden 1122i!) Arms 'as I,"
. was, I made direetly towards the poor ViEURtim, who
was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach, or Shore,
between the Place where they fat and the Sea,
3the two Butchers, who were juf'c going to work;
with him, had left him, at the Surp1ize of our firl't'
Fire, ahd fled in a terrible Fright to the Sea fide,
and had jumpd into a Canoe, and three more of the
ref: 'mad'e the fame Way:. I turn'd to Friday, and
bid him {tep forwards, and f 1e at them- , he ui1der-
flood me. immediately, and running about forty.
Yards to be near them, he ihot at them, and I
thought he had ltilldthem all- for I fee them all
fall of a Heap' into the Boat, though I faw two of
them up again quickly: l-Idwever, he killtl two'
'of them, and wounded the third -, f0 that he lay
down 111 the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead.

While my Man F1 day fir d at them, I 1111 l'ld out
my Knife, and cut the F la 3 that bound the poor
Vie'tim,' a'nd loof 11;: h. 5 Hands and Feet, I lifted
him up ,and aikd him 111 the Pmtzqguqfe Tongue.
What he was? He anfwer'd in Latin, Cbrijh'm'ms 5

but was fo weak and faint, that he 'could fearce
' - Rand,

-?1.
'i'tand or fpeak; I took my Bottle out of my Poe.-

'ket', and'gave it him, making Signs that he lhould

drink, which he did, and I gave him a Piece of
Bread, which he eat; then I alk'd him, What

Countryman he was? And he faid, bfimgniole; and

being a. little recover'd, let me know by all the

Signs' he could poflibly make, how much he was

in my Debt for his Deliverance? Seignior, faid I,

with as much Spanifb as I could make up, we will

talk-afterwards, but we mull fight now; if you

have any Strength left, take this Pil'col and Sword, .
and lay about you. He took them very thankfully,

and no fooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but

as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew

upon his Murderers like a fiery, and had out two

oft-hem in Pieces'in an infrant -, for the Truth is,

{is the whdli: was a SurpriZe to them, fo the poor

,Creatures were fo mnch frighted with the Noife cf
our Pieces, that they fell down forameer Amaze'

ment and li'ear,' and had no more Power to at~

tempt their own Efcape, than their F lelh had to

refiit our Shot 5 hand that was the Cafe of there five

that Friday {hot at in the Boat, for as three of
them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, fo the other

two fell with the Fright.

I kept my Piece in my Hand fiill, without firing,
being willing to keep my Charge ready, becaul'e I
had iven the Spaniard my Piitol and Sword -, f0 1
call'd: to Friday, and bade him run up to the Tree
from whence we firl'r fi1'degcl,'and fetch the Arms
which lay there, that had been difeharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftnefs; and then giving him
my Mnfltet, '1 fat down my felf to load all the relic
again, and bade them come to me when they want-
ed: WhileI was loading thefe Pieces, there hap-
pen'd a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard
and one ofthe Savages,who made at him with one of
' " T 4 their
their great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon. that
'was tohave kill'd him before,'if I had not prevent-
edit :I. The Spaniard, who Was .as bold . and. as brave
as could be imagin'd, though weak, had fought
this Indian a good' while, and Ihad.cu:t_f him two
great Wounds on his Head 5 but the Savage being
a flour lul'cy Fellow, clofing in with. him, had'
thrown him down (being faint) and was ,wringing
.my Sword out of his Hand, when the Spaniard, tho'
nndermofl,wifely quittingthe Sword, drew the Piflol
from his Girdle, fhot the Savage through the Body,
and kill'd'him upon, the Spot, before I, who was,
running to help him, could come near'him. .

., h'riday being nowfleft to his Liberty, purfu'd'th'e -
flying Wretches with no Weapon inhi's Hand, but
his Hatchet; and with that'he'difpatch'd thofe'
three, who, as I laid before, werewounded at firPc
and fall'n, and all the rel'c he could come up with 3
and the Spaniard coming to me for, a Gun, I gave
him one 'of the Fowling-Pieces, with Which he
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them
both 5 butas he was not able to run, they both got
from him into the Wood, where, Friday purfu'd
them. and kill'd one of them 5 but the other was too,
nimble for him; and though he was. wounded, yet
had. plung'd himfelf into the Sea, and fwam 'with
all his might of to thofe two who were left in the
Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one wound-

Thof'e. that were in the Canoe, workd hard to
get out of. Gun Shot , and tho' 1*: zday made two
or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them: Friday would fain have had me took
one yof their Canoes, and purfud them, and indeed
I was very anxious about their Efcape: leafi carry-
ing the News Home to their Pebple, they fhould
come back, p,erhaps with two or three hundred of
their Games, and devour us by meer Multitude, f0
I confented to purfue them by Sea, and running to
one of their Games, I jumpd in, and bad Friday
follow me, but when I was in the Canoe, I was
furl )I'iZ d to find another poor Creature lie there a-
live bound Hand and Foot, as the Spomzazd was,
for the Slaughter, and almoi't dead with Fear, not
knowing what the Matter was, for he had not been
able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he was

ty'd f0 hard, Neck and Heels, and had been ty d f0
long, that he had really little Life 111 him.

I immediately cut the twifled Flags, or Rui'nes
which they hady bound him with, angd would haw;
helpd him up ,but he could not 1129111101 fpeak,
but groan d 1110?: piteoufly, believing, it feems, fiill
thatg he was only unbound 1n order to be kill'd. '

When FJz'zlay came to him, I .bade him f1eak to,
him, and tell him of his Deliverance," and 1pulling
out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a

Dram, which, with the News of his being deli-

wheii Friday came to hear him fp eak, and Iook'd
in his hat 1' it would have mov 'dP any one toTears,

huggd him, cr',yd laughd, hollowd, jump'd a-

fung, and jump'd about again, like a difl'raeted
Creature. It was a good while before I could make
him 1' 1eak to me, or tell me what was the Matter,
but when he came a little to himfelt, he told me
that it was his Father.

It is not eafy for me. to exp1efs how it 11101; 'd
me to fee what Extafy and filial 1111111101"; had
work'-'d in this poor Satinge at the Sight of his Fa-
'ther, and of his being deliverd from Death -, 1101:
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of his
.Afi'ee'tion after this, for he went into the Boat and
oiit of the Boat a great many times: When he

Went in to him, he would fit down by him, open
his Breal'r, and hold his Fathe1' 3 Head clof'e to .his
Bofom, half an Hour together, to flouril'n' it, then
--he took his Arms ahd Ankles, which were numb' d
and fiifi with the B nding,a and challed and rubbed
them with his Hands 5 and I pe1ceiving What the
Cafe was gave him fome Rum out of my Bottle,
to nab them with, which did them a great deal of'
Goo '

This Aetion put an End to our Purfuit of the
Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten al'mofi out of Sig ht, and it was happy for
15's that we did not,forg1t blew f0 hard within two
Hours after, and before they could he gottena
Quartei of their Way, and continued blowing {0.
hard all Night, and that from the Nat-'fli" eff.
which was agaiiifi them, that I Could not funpoi'e
'-' '- ' . . then;the-115 Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
their ovin Co'afi. ' 1

But to return to Friday, he was f0 hufy about
his Father, that Icould-s not find 1n my Heart to
take him of? for fome Time. But after I thought
he could leave him a little, I calld him to me,
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas 'd to
the big heft Extream; then I aflcd him, If he had

given his Father any Bread? He {hook his Head,
'and faid, None: Ugly Dog eat all up felf, fo I'gave'
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carr y'd
on Purl 1ofe, I alfo gave him a Dram for himfelf,
but he would not tai're it, but carry 'd it to his Fa:
ther: :I had 1n my Pocket alfo two or three Bunches
of my Ra1f ns fo I gave him a Handful of them
for his Father He had no foone'r given his Far -
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the
Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch'd,
he run at fuch a Rate, for he was the fwiftef'r Fel-
low of his Foot that ever I faw ; l fay, he run at
inch a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,
in an Infiant; and though I call'd and hollow'd
too after him, it was all one away he went, and
in a Quarter of." an Hour, I faw--- him come back a-
gain, though not f0 faf't as he went, and as he
came nearer, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe
he had fomething 1n his Hand.

When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an Earthen Jugg, or Pot, to bring
his Father fome frefh' Water and that he had got
two more Cakes'. 01 Loaves of Bread The Bread-
he gave me, but the Water he c. any d to his Father: 1
However, as I was very thirfly too, I took a- little-

Su'p of 1t. This Water revivd his Father more
than all the Ruin or Spirits I had given him; for
he was juf'c fainting with Thirft. , '

WhenI 284 J .

' When .his Father hadrlrank, TI eall'd to him to
' know if there was any Water left; he faid, Yes;
and '1 badhim. give, it to the poor Spaniard,
'who was in as .much Want'of it as his Father;
and I fentone of the Cakes, that Friday brought,
to the Spaizz'ard too, who iwas indeed very weak,
and was repofing himfelf upon a green Place, under
the Shade of a Tree, and 'whofe Limbs were alfo
very flifi', and very much fwell'd with the rude
Bandage he had been ty'd with. .When I fawthat
upon Friday's coming to him with the Water, he
fat up and drank, and took the Bread, and he-
gan to eat; I Went to him, "and gave him a Handful
of Railins; he look'd up in my Face with all the
Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulnei's that could
' appear in anijonntenance, but wasfo weak, not-
withfianding he had fo exerted himfelf in the Fight,

to do it two or three Times, but was really not

his Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, aslie had
donehi's Father's. ' .

Canoe, withhis Feet in. the Infide of it, ~'an'd'the'f;

out 'Of the Boat, which he did.-, but they-'Iwere nei1
ther of them able to Walk; fo that. poor ,Fn'dayi
knew npt'what -to do. ' . ~ , ; = r ' .' i.
To remedy this, I wentto work in ' my- Thought}
and calling to Eidayto bid them fit'do'wn'on the
Bank while he camexto me, Ifooni made: a 'Kind'i
of. HandeBartow tolay them on, and=Friday and I"
carry" d!" them up both together upon it between usfa,'
But when we got them t0'the Outfide of our :Wally
or Fortification, we were at a worfeJLOi's than be; -
fore-,for'it was impoflible to get them/over"; and"
I was refolv'd not -to break it down: So I fet: to
workaga'inzg and Eddy and Lin about two Home
Time, made a very handfome Tent, cover'diwith
old Sails, and above that with Boughs. of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence, '
and between that and the Grove 'of young Wood '
which I-had planted: And here we made them two
Beds of fnch Things as I had'(m'z.) of good Rice- "
' Straw,Straw,- with Blankets laid upon it to lye on, and
{another to cover them on each Bed.

My Ifland was now peepled, and I thought my
felf very rich in Subjects 3 and it was a merry-Re-
flection which I frequently made, How like a King
I look'd. Pint of all, the whole Country was my
own meer Property, f0 that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion. , 2dly, My People were per'
feetly fubjeeted: I was'abfolute Lord and Law-
giver, they all ow'd their Lives. to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives, if there had been Oc-
cafion of it, for me. It was remakable too, we had
but three Subjects, and they were of three different
Religions. My Man Friday was a ProtEl'tant, his
Father was a Pagan and a Cannibal, and the Spaniard
was a Papifi: However, I allow'd Liberty of Con-
fcience throughout my Dominions: But this is by'
theWay..-- .

As foon as I had fecur'dmy'two weak refcued
Prifoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to
refi them upon, [began to think of making fome.
Provifion for them: And the firl't Thing I did, I
order'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a
Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock,'to
be kill'd: When I cut off the hinder Quarter, and
chopping it into fmall Pieces, I fet Friday to Work,
to boiling and fiewing, and made. them 'a very
.good Dill], I afiure you, of F lelh and Broth, .ha-
ving put fome Barley and Rice alfo into the '
Broth, and as I cook'd it without Doors, for I
made no Fire within my inner Wall, fo I carry'd -
it, all into the new Tent, and having fet a Table
therefor them, 1. fat down and, eat my own Din-
ner alfo with them, and, as well as I could, chear'd
them and encourag'd them : Friday being my Inter-
preter, eipecially to his Father, and, indeed, toSthe

' ' ' P"?at 287'] '

Spaniard too; for the Spaniard fpolge the Language
' ot' the Savages pretty well. . . ,-

At'ter we had dined, or rather flipped, Iorder'd
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and, go and
fetch our Mulkets and other Fire-Arms, which for
Want of Time we had left upon the Place of Battle;
and the next Day I order'd him .to go and bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which. lay Open to
the 'Sun, and would prefently be offenfive, andl
alfo ~ortler'tl him to bury' the horrid Remains of
their barbarous Feaft, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing my
felt} nay, I could not bear to fee them, iflpwent
that Way :5 All which he pune'tually perfortn'd, and
defac'd the very Appearance of the Savagesbeing
there; f0 that whenl went again, I could fcarce
know where it was, otherwife than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place. ' '

I then began to enter into a little Converf'ation
with my two new Subjects, and 'firit I fet Friday
to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the
Efcape of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether we _
might expect a Return of them with a Power too
great for us to refift: His firft Opinion was, that
the Savages in the Boat never could live out theStorrn
which blew that Night they went off, but mufitof
Neccflity be drown'd or driven South to thofe other -
Shores, where they were as fare to be devour'd as
they were to be drown'd if they were caft away;
but as to what they would do if they came fafe on
Shore, he Faid heknew not, but it was his Opini--
ou'that they were fo dreadfully frighted with the
Manner of their being attack'd, the Noife and the
Fire}, that he believ'd they would tell their People,
they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not ~
by the Hand of Man, and that the two which
appear'd, (12in B'iday and me, were two Heavenly

' SpiritsSpirits or Furies, come down to deftroy them. aiid
not Men .with Weapons: This; he fald he knew,
. becaufe he heard them all cry out fo in their Lan-

- guage to one another, for it was i'mpoilible to them

[ to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and fpeak

- Thunder, and kill at a Dillance without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage
was in the right, for, as [underflood fince by
others Hands, the Savages never attempted to go o-
ver to the Ifland afterwards; they were fo terrified
'with the Accounts given by thofe four Men, (for it
feems they did'efcape the Sea) that theyheliev'd
[Whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would be

3deflroy'd with Fire from the Gods. ' " .
' ' This however Ilmew not, and therefore was uns
'tl'er continual Apprehenfions for a good while, and
kept always upon my Guard , me and all my Army,
for as we were now four of us, I would have 'v'en.
tur'd'upon a hundred of them fairly in the open
Field at any Time. ' , ' "

" In a little Time, however, no more Canoes'ap-
pearing, the Fear of their Coming wore off, and
I began to take my former Thoughts of-a Voyage:
to the Main into COnfideratio'n, being likewife afa
fluid by E'z'day's Father; that I might depend 'upon
good Ufage from their Nation on his Account, if
i would go. ' -. . '

But my Thoughts were a little firfpended, when
I'had aferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and
when I underfloocl that there were iixteen more
Of his Countrymen and I'ortuguqfle, who having
been call away, and made their Efcape to that

was imphflible, at lead for me, to have the
IMeans of it out of mine 5 to this Purpofe,
"I mark'd out feveral Trees which I thought .fit for

to thiszPurpofe I- made Friday and the Spaniard - go
out one Day, and inyl'elf; with Friday, the next
Day, for we took our Turns: And by this Means
we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with the

the Kids. and added them to our Flock : But above

all, the Seafon for curing the Grapescoming 'on,.

I caus'd' filch a prodigious Quantity to be hung up
in the Sun, that I believe, had we beent at Alicant,
where the Railins of the Sun are cured, we could
have' fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels, and the'i'e,'-with our
Bread, was a great Part of our F ood,-and very good

which was Store enough for our Food to the next

Harvel'c, tho' all the I6 Spaniards-had been on Shore '

' When We had thus hous'd and fecur'd our Ma-

at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not

i-And now having'a full supply of Food for all
the Guei'ts I expeeted, I gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do

him a firiet Charge in Writing, not to bring any
a Man with him, who would not firft fwear in the
Prefence of himfelf and of the old Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attack the

I had not. kept-my felf long in this Poflure,_:.but
I faw the Boat draw near the Shore, as iffthey
look'd for 'a Creek to thruft in. at for the Conveni-
ence of-Landing; however, as they did'notjcoine
quite-far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet
where-I formerly landed my Rafts; but run their.
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a'
Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for
otherwife they would have landed quI, as I may
fay, at my Door, and would .foon have beaten me
out of my Cattle, and, perhaps, have plunder'd me
of all I had. . ' H ..
When they were on Shore, I was fully fatify'd
that they were Engli/b Men 3 at leaft molt of them;
one or two, I, thought were Dutch; but it did not
prove f0: There were in all eleven Men, whereof
three' of them .I' found were unarm'd, and; 'as'I
thoaght, bound, and when the firft-four or five of
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three
outof the Boat as Prifoners: One of. the three I

It was jufi: at the TOP of High-Water when thefe
People. came on. Shore, and while partly they i'tood
parlying with the Prifoners they brought, and part-
ly while they rambled about to fee hat- kind of a
Place they were "in, they had carol " y fiaid- till the

They had left two Men in the Boat, "who as I

foon came to the Boat; but it was pa'f'c all their

"and the Shore on that Side being a loft oufy Sand,

t ' In this. Condition, like true Seamen, who*3are, per-
haps,_the leal'c of all Mankind given to Fore-thought,
they gave it 'over, and away they firoll'd about the

to another, (calling theinoflgrfiomet'h'e'hoat) Why,

which I was fi lysc'o'nfirrn'd in the main Enquiry,
.Ofwhat Coan'trymen they were? . * ' ' '

All this 'while I kept niyfelf very clofe, not onCe
daring to flit out of my Callle, any farther than to
my Place of Obl'ervation, near the T01) of the Hill 5
and-very gladI was, to think how well it Twas forti-
fy'd: I knew it was no lefs than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on float again, and' by that Time I
it would be-dark, and 'I mightbe at more Liberty

they had, any. , 14' _' _ ' ' ~ ' '

_ In the mean Time, I fitted \myfelf up for a Bat-

tle, as befdre; tho' with more Caution, knowing
I had to do with another. Kindof Enemy than I had
at firf't: I o'rder'd Friday alfo, who I had made an
excellent Markf-man with his Gun; to load him-
felf with Arms: I took myfelf two Fowl-ing-Pieces,
and I gave him three .Mulket's, ' "My Figure, indeed,
was very' fierce g'I'Vhad 'n'iy formidable Gdat-fkin
Coat on, with the'great Cap '1 have mention'd, a

The three poor dif'trefled Men, too anxious for their
CGnditionto get any Sleep, were, however, fet
down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about
a quarter of a Mile from me, and, as! thought, out

help to the other; but the Captain Prepping to him,
told him, 1twas too late to cry for Help, he lh'onld
call upon God to forgive his Villany, and With that
Work knock'tl him down with the Stock of his-
Mufltet 5 f0 that he never fpoke more: There were-
three more in the Company, and one of them was
alfo flightly wounded: By this Time I was com; 5
and when they faw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to refil't, they begg'd for Mercy 2 ' The Cap-
.tain told them, he would l'pare their Lives, if they
would give him any. Affurance of their Ahhorrence
oi'the' Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
fwear to befaithful to him in recovering the Ship,
and afterwards in carrying her back to jfizmaz'aa,
from whence they came: They gave him all the
Protel'tations of theirSincerity that could be defir'd,
and he was willing to believe them, and :fpare their
Lives, which I was not againflr; only I oblig'd him
to keep them bound Hand and Foot While they were
uponthe Ifland'. ' i . '

While this was doing, I fent E'z'day with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to" fecure .
her, and bring away the Oars and Sail, which
they did; and by and by, three flragglingMen that:
were (happily for them) parted from. the ref't, came
backupon hearing the Guns fir'tl', and feeing' their
Captain, who before was their Prifoner,' now their
Conqueror, they fubmitted to be bound alfo, and
fo our Victory was compleat. .

, J t now remain'd, that the Captain and I fhould,
gnquire into one another's Circuml'tancesi I began.
firf'r, and told him. my whole Hiltory, which he.
heard with an Attention even to Amazement; and.:
particularly at the wonderfill Manner of my being.
furnilh'd with Provifions and Ammunition; and,
indeed, as, my Story is a whole Collee'tion:_,of Won- .
dens, it afieeted him deeply, but when he refieeted'

' X ' ' '. . " from
from thence upon himf'ell", and how I feem'd to
have been preferv'd there on purpofe to fave his
Life, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
he: fpeak a Word more. -
, After this COmmunication was at an End, I car-
. ry'd him. and his two Men intomy Apartment,
leading them in qut where I came out, viz. at the
Top of the Houfe, where I refrelh'd them with
"fuch Provifions as I had, and lhew'd them all the
Contriva'nCesI had made, during my long, long,
inhabiting that Place. " '
All I lhew"d them, alltl faid to them, was per.
feetly amazing; but above all, theCaptain admir'd
iny Fortification, and how perfectly I had conceal'd
my Retreat with a Groveof Trees, which having
been now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees
growing much falter than in England, was become
a little Wood, and {'0 thick, that it was unpafi'able
in any Part of it, but at that one Side, whereI
had'refer'vd my little winding Pafrage into it: I
told him, this was my Callle and my Refidence;
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as molt Prin-
_ ces have, whither I could retreat upon Occafion,
and I would'lhew him that'too another Time; -
but at prefent our Bufinels was to confider how to .
recover the Ship: He agreed with me as to that,
but told me, he was perfee'rly at a Lofs what Mea--
fures to take 5 for that there were .ltill fix and twen-
ty Hands on 'Board, who having. enter'd into a
curfed Confpiracy, by which they had all forfeited
their Lives to the Law', would be' harden'd in it
noW by Del'peration -, and would carry it on, know-
ing that if they were redt-ic'd, they'lhould be
brought to the Gallows as foon' as they came to
England, or to any of the Englifl) Colonies; and
, that therefore there would be no attacking them.
with f0 finall a Number as we were; '

"Q

I mufed
I mufed for fo'rne Time upon what he had fair],
and found it was a very rational ,Conclufion; and"
that therefore fornething was to he refolv'd on've-
ry fpeedily, as well to draw the Men 'on Board in-
to forne Snare for their Surprize, . as to prevent their
Landing upon us, and deltroying- us ~, upon this it
prefently occurr'd to me, that in a little while, the
Ship's. Crew wondering what was become of their
Comrades and of the Boat, would certainly come
on Shore in their other Boat, to fee for them, and.
that "then, perhaps, they might come arrn'd, andbe
too flrong for us 2 This he allow'd was rational.

Upon this I told him, the firl't Thing we had. to
'do, was to {tave the Boat, which lay upon the
Beach, f0 that they might not 'carryher off; and
taking everything out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs
as not to be fit to fwim {accordingly wewent oh
Board, teek the Arms which were left on Board,
'out 'of her, and whatever elfe we found there,
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Ruin, a few Bilket-Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas '5' the
Sugar 'was five or fix Pounds, all which was
'very welcome to me, efpecially the Brandy and
Sugar, of which I had had none left for many
Years. , '
When we had carry'd all thefe Things on Shore,
(the Oars, Malt, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat,
were carry'd away before, as above) 'we knockld a
great Hole'in the Bottom, that if they had come
{trong enough to mailer us, yet they could not car-
ry off' the, Boat.

Indeed, if' was not much in. my Thoughts, that
we could be able to recover theShip -, but my View
Was, that it they went away without the'Boat,I did:
not much queltion' to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward Iflands, and. .call upon our--
' X 2 Friends

faw hermake a "aft with her Antient, as a Signal
for. the Boat to common Board; but. no Boat Prirr'd;
and they fir'd feveral times, making other'Signals

Brit that as for the~Boatfwain, who it feems was
the chief Officer among them, and all. the refl, they
were-as ontragious as any of. the Ship's Crew, - and
Were no doubt made defperatein their new Enter-

would .be too powerful for us. .

-- I fmil'd'at him, and told him, that Men incur
Circumftances were pal'c the Operation of Fear:
That feeing al-mol'c every Condition that could be
was better than that which we were fuppos'd to be
in, we ought to expeet that the Confequence, Whe-
ther Death or Life,' would be fure to be a Delive-
rance. I alk'd him, What he thought of the Cir-
cumfiances of my Life? And, whether a Delive-
rance were not worth venturing for ? And where,
Sir, faid I, is your Belief of my being preferv'd here
on purpofe to fave your Life, which elevated you
a little whileago? For my Part, {aid I, there feems
to be but one T hing amifs in all the Profpee't of it:
What's-that? fays he :, why,faid I, 'Tis that, as you
fay, there are three or four honel't Fellows among
them, which lhou'd be fpar'd 5 had they been alluof
the wicked Part of the Crew, I {hould have thought
God's Providence had fingled them out to deliver
them into your Hands 5' for depend upon it, every
Man of'them'that comes aLlhore are our own, and
{hall die, or live, as they behave "to us.

As I fpolte this with a rais'd Voice and chearful
Gounte'nan'ce, I 'found it greatly encoura'g'd him; fo
we fetvigoroufly to our Bufinef's : W e had,upon the
firfi: Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship,

fur'd than ordinary, I fent with Fzz'day, and onenf
the three (deliver'd Men) to my'Cave, where they
wereremote enough, and out of Danger of being
'heard or difcovefd, or of finding their Way out of
the Woods, if they could have deliver'd them'felves,
Here they left them bound, but gavev'them Prdvilia

- ' ' X .3 quietly,

' {hould be put to Death without Mercy. They pro-

mis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement with
Patience, and were very thankful that the'y'had
' filCh good Ufage as to have Provifions, and a Light
left them, for Friday gave them Candles (fuch as
. we made our felves) for their Comfort, and they

did not know but that he flood Centinel over them
at the Entrance. ' ' ' ' '

The other Prifoners had better Ufage, two of
them were kept pinion'd indeed, becaufe the CapL
tain was not free to trult them, but the other two
were taken into my Service upon their Captain's}
Recommendation, and upon their folemnly engaJ
ging to live and die with us; To, with them and the
three honef'c Men, we were feven Men. well arm'd a
and I made no doubt we fhou'd be able 'to deal well
enough with the Ten that were a '90ming,"c0nii-"
dering that the Captain had faid, there were three
or four honel't Men amongthem alfo. ' ' "

As foon as they got to the Place where their 0-
ther Boat lay, they run their Boat into the Beach",
and Came all on Shore, haling the Boat up after
them, which I wasglad to fee, for Iwas afraid
they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor,
ibrne Diltance from the Shore; with forne Hands
in'her, to, guard her; and fo we {hould'not be able
' to feizethe Boat. -~ - ' .

Being on Shore, the firft Thing they did, they.
ranlall to the other Boat, audit was eafy to fee
that they were under a great'Surprize, to find her
firipp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a great
Hole in her Bottom; ' ' ' ' , '-'

After they had mus'd'a while upon this, they
fet up two or three great Shouts", hollowing with
all their Might, to try if they." couldmak'e then;

they came all clofe in a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of

Echoes made. the Woods ring, but it was all one,
thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear, and.
thofe in our Keeping, though they heard it well e-
nough, yet durl't give no Anfwer to them:

They "were fo atlonilh'd at the Surprize of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they refolv'd to go
all on Board again to their Ship, and let them know
there, that the Men were all murder'd, and the
Long-Boat fiav'd, accordingly they immediately
launch'd their Boat again, and got all of them
on Board.' ' he?

The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even con- "V
founded at this, believing they would go on Board
the Ship again and fet Sail, giving their Comrades
for loft; and fo' he {hould {till lofe the Ship, which
he'was in Hopes we lhould have recover'd 5. but he
was .quiclcly'as much frighted the other way.

. 'l'lhey had ' not been long put off with the Boat,
but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again,
but with this new Meafitre in their Conduet, Which
it feems they. confnlted together upon, 'UiZ. To
leave three Men in the. Boat, and the reft to go on
Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their
Fellows. ' '

' This was a great Difappointment to us; for now
.We were at a Lofs what to do, for our feizing
thofe {even Men on Shore would be no Advantage
to us, if we let the Boat efcape, becaufe they would
then row away to the Ship: and then the ref: of
them would be fare to weigh and fa Sail, and f0
our recovering the Ship would be lol'c. ,

However, we'had no Remedy but to wait and
fee what the "The of Things might prefent :. The
fat/en Men Came on Shore, and the three who re-

- ' s X 4 A niain'dL 3' 12 l" . deg
main'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Diftai'jce
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for
them; To that it was impofiible for us to come, at
them in the Boat. ' ' _ ' . .
\ Thole that came on Shore, kept clofe together,
' marching towards the Top of the little Hill, under

which my Habitation lay ;, and we could fee them
plainly, tho' they could not perceive us: we
could :have been very glad they would have come
nearergtofis, f0>> that we might have fir'dat them,
or that. they would have gone farther oil", that We .

might have come Abroad. . f l '
But when they. were come to the'Brow of the
'Hill, where they could fee a great Way into the
Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the North-
Eal't Part, and where the lfland lay lowel't, they
fliouted and hollow'd' till they'were weary ,5 and
not caring, it feems, to venture far from theShore,'
nor far from one another, theyafat down together
under a Tree, to confider ofit-z Had they thought
fit to have gone to fleep there, .as the other Party
of them had done, they had done the Iobb for us;
but they were too full of'Appreheniions of Danger;
to venture to go to .fleep, tho' they could: not tell

what. the Danger was they had to fear neither.
The Captain made a very jufi: Propofal' to me,
upon this le'ultation of theirs, viz. That per-'
haps they would all fire a Volley again, to endea-
vour to, make their Fellows \hear, <<and that we
{hould ,al-l Tally upon them, }uf'c at the juncture
when their Pieces Were'all difcharg'd, and they
would certainly yield, andwe {hould have them
without Blood-{hed :;I lilt.'d the Propofal, provided
it was done while we Were near enough to come
up to them, before they could load their Pieces
again', - -,_ .. 3. i. '

a long Time, ~\'ery irrefoliite what Courfe .tO-take5
at length Itold them, there would be nothing to:
be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they w
did not return to the Boat, perhaps .we might find
a Waylto get between-them andtheShOte, and {9
might ufe fome Stratagem with them in the Boat,

to get them oanShore.' . a. . ., . -.
"We'waited a; great while, tho? very impatient
'for their'removing, and Were very uneafy; when,
after long Confultatsons, we faw them fiart all up,

had fuch dreadful Apprehenfions upon them, .of
the Danger of thePlaee, that they refolv'd togo

Voyage with the Ship. ' i ' ' i '
' As'foon as -I perceiv'd them go towards-the Shore,
I imagin'd it to be. as it really was, That they had
iven over their Search, and were for going back

Thoughts, was ready to fink at the Apprehenfions
of it, but I pr'el'entl'y "thought of 'a Stratagem to
fetch them back again, and which anfwer'd my
End to a Tittle. ' " '. ' .

over the little Creel: Wef'tward, towards the Place

were 11relently fioppd by the Creek, wher e the
"Water being up, they could not get over, and
lcalld for the Boat to come up, and fer them over,
as indeed I expeeted.
When they had fet theiiifelv es over, X obferv'd,
that the Boat being gone up a good Way into the

Land, they took one of the three Men out of her

Boat, having faltend her to the Stump of a little
Tree 011 the Shore.

leaving. Pi zday and the C: tptain s Mate to their Buli-
nels, I took the 1'6le with me, and crofling the
Creek out of their Sight We furprizd the two
Men before they were aware, one "of them lying
on Shore, and the other heirig 1n the Boat; the
Fellow on Shore was between ileeping and waiting,
and going to {tart up, the Captain, who was fore-

The Boatfwain was kill'd upon ithe Spot, the

Uponthis, Will: Atkins cry'd out, For God's Sake,

home been all as had as I 5 which by the Way was not
true neither; for it feezns this WillfiAtkim was the
firft Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they
firfi: mutiny'd, and ufed him barharoufly, in tying
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, the Captain told him he muff lay down
his Arms at Difcretion, and trail to the Gover-

' nour's[3!3l

' . h'oiir's Mercy, by which he meant was; for they
all call'd m'e Governour. ' ' '

In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and
begg'd their Lives; and I fent the Man that had'
.parly'd with them, and mm more, who bound
them all; and then my great Army of so Men,
which particularly with thofe three, were all but

, eight, came up and feiz'd upon them-all, and Up:
on their Boat, only that I k'ept'myfelf and one
.mo're out of Sight, for Reafons of State.

0111' next Work was to repair the Boat, and to
think of feizing the Ship 3 and as for the Captain,
now he had Leifure torparly with them : He expo-
fiulated with them upon the Villany of their Pra-
EURtices with him, and at length, upon the farther'
'Wickednefs of their Defign, and how bertainly it
.muft bring them to Mifery and Difirefs in the End,
and perhaps to the Gallows: . ' , "

They all appear'd very penitent, and-begg'd hard
for their Lives: As for that, .he told them, they
were nOne of his Prifoners, but the'C'ommander's of
"the Ifland; that they thought they had fet him on
Shore in a. barren uninhabited Ifland, "but it had
pleas'd God foto direet them, that Ithe Illand
was inhabited, 'andithat the GovernotJr 'was 'an

he pleas'd; but as he had giventhem' all'Quarter,
he fuppos'd he would fend them to England, to be _
dealt with there, as Juftice requir'd, except At-
him, who was commanded by the 'Governour to
advife to prepare for Death .5 for that he' would be

hang'd in the Morning. . . ' ~. _

Though this was all a Fie'clon of his own, yet'
it had its defirdegd EH'eet; Atkins fell upon his Knees
to beg the Captain to intercede with the Govera
nour for his Life, and all the rel't begg'd of him

for'~[3x9l

for God's fake, that they might not he'fent to'
England. . . , .
ltnow occurr'd to him, that the Time of our
Deliyerance was come, and that it would be a mof'c
eafy thing to bring thefe Fellows in, to be hearty
in getting Poffefiion of the Ship; f0 I retir'd in the
Dark from them, that they mightt not fee what
Kind of a Governour they had, and eall'd the Cap:
tain to me; when I call'd, ""as at a. good Dif'canee;
one of the Men was order'd to fpeak again, and fay
to the Captain, Captain, the Commander calls for
you; and: prefently the Captain reply'd, Tell {22's
Excellenly, I am 12!]! a coming : This more perfectly
amus'd them; and they all believ'd that the Com-
..nande'r was 511?: by.with his fifty Men.
' "Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him
my Projeet for ferzmg the Ship, which he lik'd of
wonderfully well, and refolv'd to put it in Execu-
tion the next Morning. ' .
But in Order to execute it with mere Art, and
fecure of Succeis, I told him, we Inuit divide. the
Prifoners, and that he fhould go and take Atkins
and two more of the 'wori't of them, and fend them
piniorfii to the Cave where the others lay : This
'Was7eommitted' to Friday and the two Men who
came 'on Shore with the Captain.
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to at. Fri>>
fon -, and it was,.indeed, a difinal Place, efpecially
to Men in their. Condition. .
" i The other I order'd-to my Bower, as I call'd it, '
of which I have given a full Defcription 5 and as
it was fenc'd in, and they pinion'd; the Place was
fecur'e enough, confidering they were upon their
Behaviour. '. .

. To thefe in 'the Morning Itfent the Captain, who
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word,
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they

mightmight be trul'ced or no, to go on Board and flirprize
the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury done
'him'; of the Condition they were brought to; and, .
that though the Governour had given them Quaro'
_ .rterafor their Lives, as to the prelent Action, yet
- that if they were fent- to England, they would all '

' be hang'd in Chains, to .be fitre 5 but that if they
would join in' fo juft an Attempt, as to recover the
Ship, hewould have the Governour's Engagement
for their Pardon. _ ' '

_ Any one may gu'efs how readily fuch'a Propof'al
would be accepted by Men' in their Condition 5
they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and
promifed with the deepefi: Imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the lal't'Drop, and
'.--that they lhould ' owe their Lives, to him, and
would go with him all over the World; that they
would own him for a Father to them as long as
they liv'd'. - ' . ' _' ' .

Well, fays the Captain, I mull go and. tell the
Governour what you lay, and feewhat I can do
to bring him to confent to it: So he brought me
an Account of the Temper he found them in;
and that he verily believ'd they would be faithe
ful. ' ' ' 4 '

However, that we might be very feCure', I told
' him he fhould go back again, airdchufe out thofe
five, and tell them, they might fe'e,..that'he did not
want Men 5 that he would take out thofe five to be
his Affil'tants, and that the Governour Would keep
the other two, and the three that Were fent Prifo-
ners to the Cafile (my Cave) as Ho'l'cages, for the,
Fidelity of thofe five, and that if they prov'd un-f
faithful in the Execution, the five Hoftages fhould
be h'a-ng'd in Chains alive upon the Shore. '

.This'
This look'd fevere, and c0nvinc'd them that the
Governour was in Earneft 5 however, they had no
Way left them but to accept it; and it was now
the Bufinefs of the Prifoners, as much as of the
Captain, to perfwade the other five to do their
Duty.

Our Strength was now thus order'd for the Ex-
pedition : I: The Captain, his Mate, and Pafl'enger.
2. Thien- the two Prifoners of the firl't Gang, to
whom, having their Charae'ters from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trulted them with
Arms. 3. The other two, who I had kept till now
in my BOWer, pinion'd, but, upon the Captain's
Motion, had now releas'd. 4. Thefe five releas'd
at laf't, fo that they were twelve in all, befides five
we kept Prifoners in the Cave for Hoftages.

I alk"d the Captain, if he was willing to venn
ture with thefe Hands on Board the Ship -, for,
as for me and my Man Friday, I did not think '
it was proper for us to fiir, having feven Men
left behind; and it was Employment enough for
us to keep them afi'mder, and fupply them with
Vie'tuals. .

As to the. five in the Cave, I refolv'd to keep
- them faft, but Friday went in twice a Day to them,
to fupply them with Neceflaries, and I made the
other two earryProvifions to a certain Diftance,
where Friday was to take it.

.When I {hew'd my felf to the two Hof'tages, it
was with the Captain, who told them, I was the
Perfon the Governour had order'd to look after
them, and that it was the Governour's Pleafure they.
{hould not {tit any where but by my Direetion;
that if they did, they flmuld be tetch'd into the.

ver fufi'ered them to fee me as Governour, f0 I

now appear'd as another Perfon, and fpoke of the
' Y . Gover-Governour, the Garrifon, the Cafile, and the like,
upon all Occafions.

The Captain. now had no Difficulty before him,
but to'fur'niih his two Boats, Prop the Breach of
one, and man them. He made his l'affenger
Captain of one, with four other Men, and him-
felf, and his Mate, and five more went in the 0-
then And they contriv'd their Bufinefs very well,
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight. As
'1'an as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
)Robz'wfoa hale them, and tell them they had brought -
.off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long
Time before they had found them, and thelilce;
holding them in a Chatjtill they came to the Ship'is
Side, when the Captam and the Mate, entering
firfi with their Arms, immediately knock'd down
the fecond Mate and Carpenter with the But-end
of their Mufkets, being very faithfully feconded
by- their Men ; they fecur'd all the ref": that were
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to
faf'ten the Hatches to keep'them down who were '

elow, when the other Boat and their Men entering
at the fore Chains, fecur'd the Fore-Came of the
Ship, and the Scuttle which went down in the
Cook-Room, making three Men they found there
Prifoners. -

When this was done, and all fafe upon Deck, the
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break
into the'Round Houfe, where the new Rebel Capn
tain lay -, and, having taken the Alarm, was gotten
.up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire-
.Arms in their Hands; and when the Mate with 21
Crow fplit open the Door, the new Captain and
his Men fir'd boldly" among them, and wounded the
Mate with a Mufket-Ball, which broke his Arm,
and wounded two more of the Men, but kill'd no

Body. Thel 323 l ' ____,

The Mate calling for Help, rnlh'd however in-
to the Round-Honk, wounded as he was, and with
his Pil'tol {hot'the new Captain through the Head,
the Bullet entering at his Mouth, and came out
again behind one of his Ears; {0 that he never
{poke a Word, upon which the rel't yielded, and
the Ship was taken effectually, without any more
Lives lol't.

As foon as the Ship was thus ficur'd, the Cap-
tain order'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
of his Succels, which you may be fure I was very
glad to hear, having fate watching upon the Shore
for it till near two ofthe Clock in the Morning.

HaVing thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me
down 5 and it having been a Day of great Fati no
to me, I flept .very found, till Iwas fornething gur-
priz'd with the Noife of a Gun; and prefently
fiarting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name
ofGovernour, Governour, and prefently I knew the
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hill, there he flood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrae'd me in hisArins, My dear Friend and
Deliverer, fays he, there's year Skip, for flu: is all yours,
and f0 are we and all that belong to her. I call: my Eyes
to the Ship, and there {he rode within little more

than half a Mile of the Shore, for they had weigh'd
her Anchor as foon as they were Mailers of her; .
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor jolt againft the Mouth of the little Creek 5
and the Tide being up,.the Captain had brought,
the Pinnaee in near the Place where I firfl' landed
my Rafts, and fo'landed jul'c at my Door.

I was at firft ready to finlt 'down with the Sur~
prize: For I {aw my Deliverance indeed vifibly
put into my Hands, all\_Things eafy, and a large
Ship jul't ready to carry me away whither "I pliead-

- , Y 2 e
fed to go. At firl'c, for ionic Time, I was not able
to anfwer him one Word 5. but as he had taken me
in his Arms, I held felt by him, or I ihould have
' fallen to the Ground.

He perceiv'd the Surprize, and immediately
' pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a
, Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pol'e for me; after I had drank it, I fat down up-
on the Ground; and though it brought me to my
felf, yet it was a good while before I could {peak
a Word to him.

.All this while the poor Man was in as great an
Extafy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was;
and he faid a thoufand kind tender Things to me,
to compofe and bring me to my felf, but fuch
was the Flood of joy in my Breal't, that it put all
my Spirits into Confufion; at laft it broke out
into Tears, and in a little while after I recover'd
mySpeech. _

Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as
my Deliverer; and we. rejoyc'd together. I told
him, I look'd upon him as a ~Man fent from Hea--
ven to deliver me, and that the whole Tranfae'tion
feem'd to be a Chain of Wonders -, that fuch Things
as thefe were the T ellimonies we had of a fe'cret
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
fearch into the remoteft Corner of the World, and
fend Help to the Miferable whenever he pleaf'ed.

I-forgot not to lift up my Heart in T hankful-
nefs to Heaven -, and what Heart could forbear to

blefs him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
i ner provided for one in fuch a Wildernef's, and
in fuch a defolate Condition, but from whom every
Deliverance malt always be acknowledged to pro-

ceed '!
4' ,When>> [ 325' l .

When we had talk'd a while, the Ca tain told
me, he had brought me fome little Re reihment,
fuch as the Ship alforded, and fuch as the Wretches
that had been [0 long his Mailers had not plunderld
him of : Upon this he call'd aloud to the Boat, and
bid his Men bring the Things a-Shore that were for
the Governour-9 and indeed it was a Prefent, as if
I had been one not that was to be carry'd away
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the Ifland Hill, and they were to go without
me.

H Firfl: he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full
of excellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of
Madam Wine 5 the Bottles held two Qarts a-piece 5
two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good
Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and fix. Pieces of Pork,
With a Bag of Peafe, and about a hundred Weight
of Biflret.

He brought me alfo a Box of Sugar, a Box of
Flower. a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of
Lime-juice, and abundance of other Things: But
b'efides there, and what was a thoufand times more
ufelul to me, he brought me fix Clean new Shirts,
fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves,
one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stock---
ings, and a .very good Suit of Cloaths of his own,
which had been worn but very little 2 'ln a Word,
he cloathed me from Head to Foot.

It was a very kind and agreeable Prefent, as any
one may imagine, to one in my Circuml'tances:
But never was any thing in the World of that Kind
f0 unpleal'ant, awkard, and uneafy, as it was to
me to wear {itch Cloaths at their firfi putting on.

After thefe Ceremonies paf'c, and after all his
good Things were brought into my little Apart-
ment, we began to confult what was to be done
with the Prifoners we had; for it'was worth con-

Y 3 . fidering'\ [-326]

fidering, whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, efpecially two of them,- who
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
hit Degree; and the Captain faid, he knew they
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging
' them, and if he did carry them away, it mutt be
in Irons, as Malefaetors to be deliver'd over to Ju-
flice at the firf'c Eflglifl) Colony" he could come at;
and I found that the Captain himfelf was very
anxious about it. ~

Upon this, I told him, that if he defir'd it, I
durfi undertake to bring the two Men he f poke of,
to make it their own Requefi that he fliould leave
them upon the Ifland: I _//)ould be very glad of that,
fays the Captain, with all my Heart.'

Well, fays I, I will fend for them up, and talk
with them for you 5 TO I caus'd Friday and the two
Hoflages, for they were now difcharg'd, their Com-
rades having perforrn'd their Promife, I fay, Icau-
fed them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five
Men pinion'd, as they were, to the Bower, and
keep them there "till I came.

After fome Time, I came thither drefi'd in my
new Habit, and nowI was call'd Governour again 5
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caus'd
the Men to he brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full Account of their villanious Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had ran away
With the Ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther Robberies, but that Providence had en-
fnar'd them in their own Ways, and that they
were fall'n into the Pit which they had digg'd for
others. ,

I let them know, that by my Direc'tion the Ship
had been feiz'd, that {he lay now in the Road, and
they might fee by and by, that their new Captlaifi

.5 a
had receiv'd the Reward of his Villainy; for that
they might fee him hanging at the Yard-Arm. '

That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to fay, whyI lhould not execute them as 'Pi-
rates taken in the Faith as by my Commilfion they
could not doubt I had Authority to do.

One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the refl,
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken the Captain promis'd them their
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy: But
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to {hew them;
for, as for myfelf, I had refolv'd to quit the
Ifland with all my Men, and had, taken Paffage
with the Captain to go for England: And as tor
the Captain, he could not carry them to England,
other than as Prifoners in Irons to be try'd for
Mutiny and running away with the Ship; the
Confequencc _ of which they muft needs know
would be the Gallows; fo that I could not tell
which was belt for them, unlefs they had a Mind
totake their Fate in the Ifland; if they defir'd that,
I did not care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had
fome Inclination to give them their Lives, if they
thought they could lhift on Shore.

They feem'd very thankful for it, faid they
would much rather venture to Pray there, than to
be carry-'d to England to be hang'd; lo I left it on

that Iflhe. . 3
However, the Captain feemd to make fome

Difficulty of it, as if he durfl: not leave them '

there: Upon this I feem'd a little angry with the
Captain, and told him, That they were my Prifo-
ners, not his, and that feeing I had offend them
fo much Favour, I would be as good as my Word 5
and that if he did not think fit to confent to it, I

would fet them at Liberty as I found them; and
Y 4 if

\
if he did not like it, he might take them again if
he could catch them.

Upon this they appear'd very thankful, and I
accordingly fet them at Liberty, and bade them re-
tire into the Woods, to the Place whence they came,
- andI would leave them forne Fire Arms, fome

Ammunition, and fome Direetions how they {hould
live very well, if they thought fit. .

Upon this, 1 prepar'd to go on Board the Ship,
but told the Captain, that I would Pray that Night
to prepare my Things, and defir'd him to go on
Board in the mean' Time, and keep all right in
the Ship, and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day
for me, ordering him, in the mean time, to caufe
the new Captain who was kill'd, to be hangk'i at
.the YardvArm that thefe Men might fee him.

When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Men
up to me to my Apartment, and enter'd ferioufly
into Difcourfe with them of their Circumf'cances,
I told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice; that if the Captain carry'd them away,
they wmgd certainly be hang'd. I ihew'd them
the new aptain, hanging at the Yard Arm of the
Ship, and told them they had nothing lefs to expee't.

When they had all declar'd their Willingnefs to
Pray, I then told them, I would let them into the

' Story of my living there, and put them into the
Way of making it eafy to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole Hif'rory of the Place, and of
my coming to it; {hew'd them my Fortifications,
the Way I made my Bread. planted myflorn, cu-
red my Grapes -, and in a Word, all that was ne-
cefl'ary to make them eafy: I told them the Story
alfo of the fixteen Spaniards that were to be expect-

' eet :, for whom I left a Letter, and made them pro--
mife to treat them in common with themfelves.

I left
I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Mufkets,
three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left; for after
the firft Year or two, I us'd but little, and wafted
none. I gave them a Defcription of the. Way I
manag'd the Goats, and Direetions to milk and
fatten 'them, and to make both Butter and Cheefe.

In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own
'Story, and] told them, I would prevail with the
' Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder
more, and fome Garden-Seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of; alfo I gave them
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought
me to eat, and bade them be fure to fow and en-
creafe them.

Having done all this, I left them the next Day,
and went on Board the Ship: We prepar'd imme-
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night:
The next Morning early, two of the five Men
came fwimming to the Ship's Side, and making a
molt lamentable Complaint of the other three,
begg'd to be taken into the Ship, for God's Sake,
for they ihou'd be murder'd, and begg'd the Cap-
tain to take them on Board, tho" he hang'd them
immediately.

Upon this, the Captain pretended to have - no
PoWer without me, but after forne Difficulty, and
after their folemn Promifes of Amendment, they
were taken on Board, and were forne time after
foundly Whipp'd and pickl'd, after which, they
prov'd very honeil and quiet Fellows.

' Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on
Shore, the Tide being up, with the Things promio
f ed to the Men, to which the Captain, at my Inter--
cefiion, caus'd their Chefis and Cloaths to be add-
ed, which they took, and were very thankful for;
I alfo encourag'd them, by telling them, that if

it.
it lay in my Way to fend any Veflel to take them
in, I would not forget them.

When I took Leave of this Ifland, I carry'd on
Board for Reliques the great Goat's Skin-Cap I
had made, my Umbrella, and-one of my Parrots -,
' alfo Iforgot'not to take the Money I formerly men-
tioh'd, which had lain by me fo long ufelefs, that
it was grown rui'cy, or tarnifh'd, and could hardly
pafs for Silver, till it had been a little rnbb'd. and
handled 5 as alfo the Money ifound in the Wreck
' of the Spanifl) Ship. ,

. And thusI left the Ifland, the Nineteenth of
December, as I found by the Ship's Account, in the
Year 1686, after [had been upon it eight and
twenty Years, two Months, and nineteen Days;
being deliver'd from this fecond Captivity the fame
Day of the Month, that I firl't made my Efcape, in
the Barco-Lowgo, from among the Moors of Sallee.

In this Veflel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in
England, the Eleventh of fume, in the Year 1-6 87,
having been thirty and five Years abfent.

When I came to England, I was as perfeet a
. Stranger to all the World, as if I had never been
known there. My Benefae'tor and faithful Stew-
ard, who I had left in Truft with my Money, was
alive ~,but had had great Misfortunes in the World,
was become a Widow the fecond Time, and very
low in the World 2 I made her eafy as to what {he
ow'd me, alluring her, I would give her no Trouble -,_
but on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former
Care and Faithfulnefs to me, I reliev'd her,'as my
little Stock would afford, which at that Time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her; but I af-
fur'd her, I would never forget her former Kindnefs
to me, nor did I forget her, when I had fufiicient

to help her, as lhall ~be obferv'd in its. Place.
~ I went
I went down afterwards into Torkjbz're -, but my '
Father was dead,. and my Mother, and all the Fa-
mily extinct, except that I found two Sifters, and
two of the Children of one of my Brothers -, and as
I had been long ago given over for dead, there had
been no Provifion made for me,fo that, in a Word,
I found nothing to relieve or ailil't me; and that
little Money I had, would not do much for me, as
to fettling in the World.

I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, That the Mafizer
of the Ship, who I had fo happily deliver'd, and .
by the fame Means fav'd the Ship and Cargo, ha-
ving given a very handfome Account to the Own-
ers of the Manner howl had fav'd the Lives of
the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and fome other Merchants concern'd, and '
all together made me a very handfome Complement
upon the Subject, and a Prefent of almolt two
hundred Pounds Sterling. .

But after making feveral 'Reflee'cions upon the
Circumfiances of my Life, and how little Way this
would go towards fettling me in the World, I re;
folv'd to go to' Lz'jbon, and fee if I might not come
by fome Information of the State of my Plantation
in the Brajils, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who I had Reafon to fuppofe had fome Years
now given me over for dead.

With this View I took Shipping for, Lifl'on,
where I arriv'd in April following; my Man Fri- -
(lay accompanying me very honef'cly in all thefe
Ramblings, and proving a molt faithful Servant
upon all Occafions.

When I came' to Li/bon, I found out, by. Enqui~'
ry, and to my particular Satisfaetion, my old Friend
the Captain of the Ship, who firl't took me up at
Sea, of of the Shore of Africk : He was now

' i - grown-[ 33 2 3

grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put
his Son, who was far from a young Man, into 'his
Ship -, and who ilill ufed the Brajil Trade. The
old Man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly

knew him, but I foon brought him to my Re-
. membrance, and as foon brought myfelf to his Re-
membrance, when I told him who I was,

After fome pailionate Expreflions of the old Ac-
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be fure, after my
Plantation and my Partner: The old Man told me
he had not been in the Bra/{ls for about nine Years5
but that he could allure me, that when he came
away, my Partner was living. but the Truftees,
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of
my Part, were both dead; that however, he be
liev'd that I would have a very good Account of
the Improvement of the Plantation 5 for that upon
the general Belief of my being call away and
drown'd, my Trul'cees had given in the Account of
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the
Procurator Fifcal , who had appmpriated it, in
Cafe! never came to claim it, one Third to the
King, .and two Thirds to the Monaf'tery of St. Aug
git/{2.728, to be expended fOr the Benefit of the Poor,
and for the Converfion of the Indium to the Catho-
lick Faith -, but that if I appear'd, or any one for
me, to claim the Inheritance, it fliould be rel'tor'd -,
only that the Improvement, or annual Production,
being dillributed to charitable'Ufes, could not..be
rei'cor'd, but he allur'd me, that the Steward of
the King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Provedig
dore, or SteWard of the Monal're'ry, had taken great
Care all along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay,
my Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account of

the Produce, of which they receiv'd duly my
Moiety.

I alk'd[ 333 l .

i I afk'd him if he knew to what Height of Im-
provement he had bIOUght the Plantation? And,
whether he thought it might be worth looking af-
ter, or whether, on my going thither, I fhould
meet with no Obflrue'tion to my poffifling my jui'c
Right in the Moiety? - "

He told me, he could not tell exaCtly to what
Degree the Plantation was improv'd, but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one Half of it 5 and that, to
the belt of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Part, which was, it feems,
granted away to forne other Monai'tery, or reli-
gious Houfe, amounted to above two hundred
Moidores a Year 5 that as to my being ref'cor'd to a
quiet PoITeilion of it, there was no Quel'tion to 'be
made of that, my Partner being alive to witnefs my
Title, and my Name being alfo enroll'd in the
Regif'ter of the Country; alfo he told me, that
the Survivors of my two Trui'tees, were very fair
honeft People, and very wealthy , and he believ'd
I would not only have their Aflifiance for putting -
me in Poffeifion, but would find avery confiderable
Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account 5
being the Produce of the Farm, while their Fathers
held the Trult, and before it was given up, as a-
bove, which, as he rememberH, was for about;

. twelve Years.

I fhew'd myfelf a little concern'd, and uneafy
at this Account, and enquir'd of the old Captain,
how it came to pals, that the Trufiees ihould thus
difpofe of my EH'eets, when he knew that I had
made my Will, and had made him, the Portu-
guefe Captain, my univerfal Heir, (9'6.

He told me, that was true; but that as there

a was no Proof of my being dead, he could not aet
as Executor, until fome certain Account {houlcl

CORN";.. . l 334 l ,

come of my Death 5 and that befides, he was not
Willing to intermeddle with a Thing fo-remote:
That 1t.was true, he had regiiter'd my Will,"
and. put 1n his Claim; and could he have given.
any Account of my being dead onalive, he would
' have acted by Procuration, and takenl'oflifiion of
the Inger-250, (f0 they call'd the Sugar-houfe) and had
given his Son, who was now at't'lie'Bz-ufils, Order
to do it. . - 1"

'But, fays the old Man', I", have one Piece of
News to tell you, which, perhaps, may not be fo
acceptable to you as the red, and that is, That
believing you were loftuan'd. all-the World believ-
ing f0 alfo, ydur Partner and Truftees did offer
to accompt to me in your ,Name, for fix or eight
of the firfi Years of " Profits, which I receivd;
but there being at that Time, fays he, great Dif-
burfements for increafing the Works, building an
Ingenio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount to
near ('0 much as afterwards it produc'd : However,
fays the old Man, I {hall give you a true Account
of what I have receiv'd in all, and how I have
difpos'd of it. - '

After a few Days farther Conference with this
ancient Friend, he brought me an Account of the
fix firf'c Years Income of my Plantation, lign'd by
my Partner, and the Merchants Trufiees, being
always deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chefis, befides Rum, Mololfus, EUR92.
which is the Confequence of'a Sugar-Work 5 and"
I found, by this Account, that every Year the In-
come confiderably increas'd; but, as above, the
Diflmrfement being large, the Sum at firft was
finall: However, the old Man'let me fee, that he
was Dehtdr to me 470 Moidores of Gold, befides
6o Chefl's, of Sugar, and is double Rolls of To-

bacco, which'were 101': in his Ship 5 he having Egan
P-
ihip-wreck'd coming Home to LzZ/eon, about 11
Years- after my leaving the Place.- . .

The good Man then began to complain of his
Misfortunes, and howhe had been oblig'd to make
' Ufe of my Money to recover, his Lofles, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old
Friend, fays he, you {hall not want a Supply in
your Neceflity; and as foon as .my Son returns,
you {hall be fully fatisfy'd. = -

Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives
me 160 Portugal Moidores in Gold; and giving
me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, which
his Son was gone to the Brafils in, of which he
was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another,
he puts them both into myfl-Iands for Securityof
the refi. . s ' . ,

I was too. much mov'd with the Honelty and
Kindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to hear this;
and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and how generoufly he
had ufed me on all Occafions, and, particularly,
'how fincere a Friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he faid to me :
Therefore, firl'r I afk'd him, if his Circumfiances
admitted him to fpare f0 much Money at that Time,
and if it would not flraiten him > He told me, he '
could not fay but it might firaiten him a little";
but however, it was my Money, and I might want
it more than he. ..

Every thing the good Man (aid was full of Af-
feetion, and I could hardly refrain from Tears
while he f'poke: In fhort, I took 100 of the Moi-
dares, and call'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt for them -, then I return'd him the red, and
told him, if ever I had Pofl'eflion of the Plantation,
I would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I
afterwards did; and that as to the Bill (if Sale of

, ~ ' hisE 33 6 l . .
his Part in his ,Son's Ship, I would not take it by -
,, any Means, but that if I wanted the Money, I
found he Was honef'c enough to pay me; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me Rea-
fon to expeet, I would never have a Penny more
from him. -

When this was pafe'd, the old Man began to afk
me, if he lhould put me in a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation? I told him, I thought to'
go over to it myfelf: He faid, I might do 1'0 if I
pleas'd, but that if I did not, there were Ways e-
nough to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Profits to my Ufe, and as there were
Ships in the River of Li/bmz, jul'c ready to go away
'to Brafll, he made me enter my Name in a publick
Regif'ter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath
that I was alive, and that I was the fame Perfon
whotook up the Land for the Planting the faid
Plantation at firl'c.

This being regularly atteflzed by a Notary, and
a'Procuration afix'd, _he'direEURted me to fend it with
a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Ac.
quaintance at the Place, and then propos'd my
fiaying with him'btill an Account came of. the Re.
turn. ' '

Never anything was more honourable than the
Proceedings upon this Procuration, for in leis than
feven Months I receiv'd a large Packet from the
Survivors of my Trnf'cees the Merchants, for whofe
Account I went to Sea, in which were the follow-
ing particular Letters and Papers enclos'd.

Fir/I, There was the Account Current of the
Produce of my Farm or Plantation, from the Year
when their Fathers had balane'd with my old Por-
tugal Captain, being for fix Years 5 the Balance
lappear'd to be 1 174. Moidores in my Favour.

Secondly,. - E 337 ]

Secondly, There was the Account of four Years _
more, while they kept the Eff'ee'ts in'their Hand's,
before the Government claim'd the Admininra-
tion, as being the Efi'ee'ts of. a Perfon not to be
found, which they call Cz'vz'l Death; and the Bal-
lance of this, the Value of the Plantation encrea-
fing, amounted to Cruifadoes, which made
3241 I'Iiioidbrcse' . .

sz'rdiy, There was the Prior of the Align/1,511.63
Account, who had receiv'd the Profits for above
fourteen Years 5- but not being to account for what
was difpos'd to the Hofpital, very honei'tly declar'd
he had .87 2' Moidores not difiributed, which he
acknowledg'd to my Account; as to the King's
Part, that refunded nothing.
' There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratula-
ting me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giVing me an Account how the Eltate was im-
prov'd, and what it prod'uc'd aYear, with a Par-
ticularof the Number of Squares or Acres that it
contain'd;~ how planted, how many Slaves. there
were upon it 5 and making two and twenty Crofl'es'
for Bleflings, told me he had {aid-f0 many flee Mm
ria's to thank the Blefihd Virgin that I was aliVe;
inviting me very paiiinnately to come. over and.
take Poffefiion of my own, and in the mean time
to .give him Orders to whom he {houid deliver my
Effects, if I did not come my felf; concluding
with a hearty Tender of his Friendihip, and that
of his Family, and fent me, as a Prefent, feven
fine Leopard's Skins, which he had, it feems, recei-
ved from Africa, by fome other Ship which he had.
fent thither, and who, it feems, had made a better
Voyage than I: He fent me alfo five Cheftsnf ex:-
cellent Sw'eatmeats, and an hundred Pieces ofGold:
uncoinfd, not quite [0 large as Moidores.

Z' 'By
_ By the fame Fleet," my two Merchant-Truflees
' ihipp'd me I 200 Chefls of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To-
bacco, and the ref'c of the whole Accompt in Gold.

I might well fay now, indeed, That the latter

' End of 3'01] was better than the Beginning. It is
impoflible to exprefs the Flutterings of my very
Heart, when I look'd over thefe Letters, and efpe-
cially when I found all my Wealth about me; for
as the Brajil Ships come all in Fleets, the fame
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
Goods; and the Efi'ee'cs were fafe in the River be-

,fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a Word,

I turn'd pale, and grew lick; and had not the old
Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial, Ibelieve the
fudden Surprize of joy had overfet Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot. .

Nay, after that I- continued very ill, and was f0

Tome Hours, "till a Phyfician being fent for, and
fomething of the real Caufe of my Illnefs being
known, he order'd me to be let Blood 3 after
which I had Relief, and grew well : But I verily
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given
anfihat Manner to the Spirits, I fhould have
.yI was now Mafler, all one fudden, of above
SScoo l. Sterliwg in Money, and had an Efiate, as
I might well call it, in the Brajils, of above a'
thou'fand Pounds a Year, as fure as an Eltate of
Lands in England: And, in a Word, I was in a
Condition which I fearce knew how to underfiand,
o; how-to compofe my felf for the Enjoyment
o it.

The firf'c Thing Idid, was to recompenfe my
original Benefaetor, my good old Captain, who
had been firfl Charitable to me in my Diflrefs,
Kind to me in the Beginning, and Honef't to me at

the End: I lhew'd him all that was fent me ,1;
t0
told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven",
which difpofes all Things, it was owing to him;
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred fold ': So I firl'c return'd to
him the hundred Moidores I had reCeiv'd of him,
then I fent for a Notary, and caus'd him to draw
up a General Releafe or Difcharge'for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd me,
in the fullefl: and firmefl: Manner poflible; after
which, I causTd a Procuration to be drawn, im-
powering him to be my ReceiVer of the annualPro-
fits of my Plantation, and appointing my Partner
to accompt to him, and make the Returns by the
ufual Fleets to him in my Name, and a Claufe in
the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, during his Life, out of the Efl'eets, and so
Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for his Life:
And thus I requited my old Man,

I' was now to confider which Way to i'ceer my
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eltate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands; and, in-
deed, I had more Care upon my Head now, than".
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland,
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and
had nothing but what I wanted: Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs
was how to fecure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to
' hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
Without Lock or Key, "till it grew mouldy and
tarnilh'd before any Body would meddle with it:
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or
who to trufi: with it. My old Patron, the Cap-
tain, indeed was honelt, and that was the only
Refuge I had. '

In thenext Place, my Interel't in the Brajils
feem'd to fummon me thither, but now I could

not tell how to think of going thither, "till I had
Z 2 fettled ', [ 34-0 l _ _ .
fettlecl my AEairs, and left my Effects in forne fafe'
Hands behind me. .At firl'r I thought of my .old-
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honelt, and
would be jul't to me, but then {he was in Years,
. and but poor, and, for ought I knew, might be in
Debt, fo that, in a Word, I had no Way but to
go. back to England my felf, and take my Effects
with me. ' .

It was forne MonthshoWeV'er before I refolv'd
upon this ,'and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaetion, who had
been my former Benefae'tor, fo I began to think of
my poor Widow, whofe Hufliand had been my'
firl'c Benefaetor, and {he, while it was in her Power,-
my faithful Steward and lnl'rrue'tor. So the firl'c
Thin I did, I got a Merchant in Li/lm: to write to
his Cgorrefpondent in Landmanot only to pay, a
Bill, but to go find 'her out, and carry her in Mo-
ney an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her
{he fhould, if I liv'd, have a farther Supply: ' At _
the fame time I fent my two Sifters in the Coun-
try, each of them an hundred Pounds, they being,
though not in Want, yet not in very" good Circum-t
fi'ances; one having been marry'd, and left a Wio.
(low, and the other having a Hufhand not ('0 kind
to her as he fhould be. .

But among all my Relations or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durl'r
commit thfiiGrofs of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Brajz'ls, and leave Things fafe behind
me 3 and this greatly perplex'd me.

I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafilr,
and have fettled my felf there, for I was, as it
were, naturaliz'd to the Place :, but I had fome lit-
tle Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which in-

fenfibly drew me back, of which I {hall fay more
. prefintly.f '3 4 ', l

prefently. HoWever, it Was not Religion that
kept me from goingth'ere for the prefent; and as
I had made no Scruple of being openly of the Re-
ligion of the Country, all the while I was among
them, fo neither did I yet; only that now and
then having of late thought more of it, (than for-
merly) when I began to think of living and (1 ing
among them, I began to regret my having pro efs'd
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the
belt Religion to die with.

But, as I have faid, this was not the main Thing

that kept me from going to the Brajz'ls; but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my Ef-
fee'cs behind me; Yo I refolv'd at laf'c to go to Eng-
land with it, where, if _I arriv'd, Iconcludedl {hould
make fome Acquaintance, or find forne Relations
that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I
prepar'd .to go for England with all my Wealth. .
' In Order to prepare Things for my going Home, I
fill (the Brafil F lee't being juft going away) refolv'd
to give Anfwers fuitahle to the jail: and faithful Ac-
count of Things I had from thence; and firft to the
Prior of St. Augujz'z'n I erte a Letter full of Thanks
for their ju'fl: Dealings, and the Offer of the 872
Moidores, which was indifpos'd of; which I defir'd
might be given, 500 to the Monaf'tery, and 372 to
the Poor, as the Prior fh'ould direet, defiring the
good Padres Prayers for me, and the like.
i I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two
Trul'cees', with all the Acknowledgment that f0
m'ueh' Jul'tic'e and Honel'ty calldegd for g, as for {End-
ing them any Prefent, they were far above having
any Oec'afion of it. ,

Lafily, I wrote to my Partner, acknor-vledging
his Induftry in the Improving the Plantation, and
his Integrity in encreafing the Stock of th: Waits,
giving him Inflruttions for his future Got :'s'n-

Z 3 ' - malt
ment of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to
fend whatever became due to me, 'till he fhould
hear from me more particularly; affuring him, that
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but
' to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my
Life: To this I added a very handfome Prefent of
forne Italian Silks for his Wife and two Daughters,
for fuch' the Captain's Son inform'd me he had;
with two Pieces of fine Englifl) Broad-Cloath, the
belt I could get inLi/bon, five Pieces of black Bays,
and f'ome Flanders Lace of a good Value.

Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Cargoe,
and turn'd all my Effects into good Bills of Ex-
change, my next Difficulty was, which Way to go
to England: I had been accuf'com'd enough to the
Sea, and yet I had a firange Averfion to goingto
England by Sea at that T ime; and though I could
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encreas'd
upon me f0 much, that though I had once lhipp'd
. my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind,

and that not once, but two or three times,

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea,
and this might be fome of the Reafons: But let
no Man flight the flrong Impulfes of his own
Thoughts in Cafes of fuch Moment: Two of the
Ships which I had fingl'd out to go in, Imean,
more particularly fingl'd out than any other, that
is to fay, {0 as in one of them to put my Things on
Board, and in the other to .have agreed with the
Captain, I fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'd, viz.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was
caft away on the Start near Tarbay, and all the Peo-
ple drown'd except three; fo that in either of thofie

Vefl'els I had been made miferable, and in which
molt, It was hard to fay.

Having
Having been thus harals'd in my Thoughts, my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing:
prefs'd me earneltly not to go by Sea, but either
to go by Land to the Groyize, and crofs over the
Bay of Bifcay to Rochell, from whence it was but
an eafy and fate Journey by Land to Paris, and fo
to Calais and Dover ;' or to go up to Madrid, and f0
all the Way by Land through France.

In a Word, I was {'0 prepofl'efs'd againl'c my going
. by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that
I refolv'd to travel all the Way by Land 5 which,
as I was not in Hafle, and did not value the
Charge, was by'much the pleafanter Way 5 and to
. make it more f0, my old Captain brought an Eng-
li/I) Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Li/bou,
who was willing to travel with me: After which,
we pick'd up two more Englijb Merchants alfo, and
two young Portngnefl: Gentlemen, the lad: going to
Paris only; {'0 that we were in all fix of us, and
five Servants; the two Merchants and the two
Portuguqfe contenting themfelves with one Servant
between two, to fave the Charge; and as for me,
I got an Englifi Sailor to travel with me 'as a Ser-
vant, befides my Man Friday, who was too much
, a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the Place of
a Servant on the Road.

In this Manner I fet out from Li/boit, and our
Company being all very well mounted and arm'd,
we made a little Troop, whereof they dltl me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe I was
the oldefl'. Man, as becaufe I had two Servants,
and, indeed, was the Original of the whole Jour-
ne .

Journals, fo I {hall trouble you now With none of

' pen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I ~
Inuit not omit. ' '
When. we came to Madrid, we being all of us'
Strangers to Spain, were willing to Pray folne Time
to flee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was
' "worth obferving; but it being the latter Part of
the Summer, we halten'd away, and fet out from
Madrid about the Middle of Oeiolzer :, But when we. .
came to the Edge of szrre, we were alarm'd at
fi'veral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the
Mountains, that feveralTravellers were obligidj
t'o comeback to Pampeluiza, after having attempted;
at an extreme Hazard, to pals on. g ' - -
W en we came to Pampeluna itfelf, we found it
re) indeed; and to me that had been always ufed
to, a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths' on, the Cold was
infufferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than"
it-was furprizing, to come but ten Days before out
of the Old Cafli-le, where the Weather was net only
warm, but very hot; and immediately'to feel 21
Wind from the Pyrenemz Mountains,'fo very keen,
f0 feVerely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en-
danger benumbing' an'd'peri'fhing'of' our Fingers
and Toes. , ' '
Poor Friday was really frighted when he law the
Mountains all cover'd with Snow,"and felt Cold
Weather. which he had never feen- or felt before
in his Life. ' ' 1 i ' p '
To mend the Matter, when we came to Pam;
yelzma, it continu'd' fnowing 'with [0 tnuch Vio-
lence, and f0 long, that the People fa1d,'Winter
was coine before 'its Time, and the Roads, which
were difficult before, were now quite itiipallableg.
for, in a Word, the Snow lay'in fozne'Places too
thick for us to travel; and being not hard frozen;
<<was.
as is the Cafe in Northern Countries, there was no
going without being in Danger of being bury'd
"alive every Step. _We Paaid no lefs than twenty
Days at Pampelzma 3 when (fceing the Winter toms
ing on, and no Likelihood of it's being better, for .
it was the feverefi. Winter all over Europe that had
been known in' the Memory of Man) I propos'd
that we {hould all go away to Fontemlzia, and there
take Shipping for' Baztrdeaux,' which was a veery
little Voyage; " ' j ' '
But while we wereconfidering this, there came
in four Freud: Gentlemen, who having been fiop'p'd
On the French Side of the Paff'es, as We were on the
fipanijlz, had found out a Guide, who traverfing the
Country near the Head of Lm'zguedbc, had brought
them over the Mour'itains by fuch Ways, that
they were not much incommoded with the Snow;
and Where they met 'with Snow in' anyQuantity,
they laid it was frozen hard enough to bear ithein
and their Horfes. " 'fi ' i ' _ '
" We Rent for this Guide, who told-us, he would
undertake to carry Us the fame Way, 'with no Ha-
'zard from the Snow; provided we were arm'd fufl
ficiently' to 'proteef' Us from'wild Beafis'; for, he
faid, upon'thel'e great SnOws, 'it was frequent for
fome Wolves to thew themfelves' at the Foot of
the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want of
Food,' the Grdun'd being cover'd with 'Snow'; We
told him we 'were well enough prepar'd for fuch
Creatures as they were, if he would enfure us from
a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which, we were told;
we were" in molt Danger from, efpec'ially on the
French Side of the Mountains. ' ' " ' -'

' He'fatisfy'd us there was no Dan er of that Kind,
in the Way that We were'to go: '0 we readily a-

' tlemen,,with their Servants, fom'e French, forne Spa;

were oblig'd to come back again. 1 -

Accordingly, we all fet out from Pampeluna, with
. our Guide, on the fifteenth of November, and in-
deed, I was furpriz'd, when infiead of going for-
. ward, he came directly backwith us, on the fame

Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles; when, being pafs'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found ourfelves in 'a
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea-'
fant, and no Snow to be feen; but on a fudden,
turning to the Left, he approach'd the Mountains
another Way, and though it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many
Tours, fuch Meanders, and led us by fuch wind-
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the
Height of the Mountains, without being much
incumber'd with the Snow; and all ,on a fudden
he ihew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces of Lan-
guedoc and Gafcoz'gn, all green and fidurilhin g 5 tho'
indeed it was at a great Dif'cance, and we had fome
rough Way to pafs yet. '

We were a little uneafy however, when" we found
it fnow'd one whole Day, and a Night, fo fall,
that we could not travel; but he bid us be eafy,
we {hould foon be paft it all: We found, indeed',
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come
more North than before; and fo depending upon
our Guide, we went on. '

It was about two Hours before Night, when
our Guide being fomething before us, and not 'jufl;
in Sight, out rufh'd three monl'trous Wolves, and
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn-
ing to a thick Wood, two of the Wolves flew. up-e
on the Guide, and had he beenhalf a Mile before
'us, he had been devour'd indeed, before we clould -'

have help'd him : One of them faflen'd upon his
Horfe, and the other attaclt'd the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or 'not Prefence -
of Mind enough to draw his Pifi'ol, but hollow'd
and cry'd out to us mof't lufiily; my Man Friday
being next to me, I bid him ride up, and fee what
Was the Matter, as foon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, 0 Ma-
fler! O Mafler! But like a bold Fellow, rode. di-
ree'tly up to the poor Man, and with his Plfiol
{hot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head.

It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday 3 for he having been ufed to that
kind of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him; but went clofe up to him, and {hot him, as
above; whereas any of us would have fir'd at a far-
ther Difiance, and have, perhaps, either mifs'd the
Wolf, or endangerfl {hooting the Man.

But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Compa-
ny, when with the Noife of Friday's Pii'tol, we
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Eccho of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them 5 and perhaps,
indeed, "there was not fuch a few, as that we had
no Caufe of Apprehenfions.

However, as Friday had kill'd this Wolf, the o-
ther, that had faflen'd upon the Horfe, left him im-
mediately, and fled 5 having happily faflen'd upon
his Head, where the Bofl'es of the Bridle had {luck

Hurt: The Man, indeed, was mofi hurt; for the '
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee a,

My Man Friday had deliver'd our Guide, and
when we came 'up to him, he was helping him off
from his Horfegifor the Man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laf'c more than the firfl;
when'on the'fudde'n, we fpy'd the Bear come out
of the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was, the
biggefl: by fat that ever I faw. We were all'a little
furprizkl when we faw him; hutwhen Edda}: faw

of Pumps, (as we call. the flat Shoes the}r wear)
and which he had in his Pocket, gives my other
Servant his Horfe, and, with his Gun,away he flew,
fwift like the Wind. ,

The Bear was walking foftly on, and offend to
meddlewith no Body, till E'z'day coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could underiland
him; Hark ye, bark ye, fays Friday, oizejjiaakee wit
you .- We follow'd at a Dif'tance, for now being
come down on the Gafcoigsz Side of the Mountains,
we were enter'd a vaft great F orel'c, where the Coun-
try was plain, and pretty open, tho' many Trees
in it fcatter'd here and there. E-iday
, Friday, who had, as we fay, the Heels of the Bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
Stone, and throws at him, and hit him jui'c on the
, Head; but did him no more Harm, than if he had
thrown it againf't a Wall; but it anfwer'd Friday's
End; for the Rogue was f0 void of Fear, that he
did it purely to make the-Bear follow him, and
{how its fome Laugh, as he call'd it. 1 ,

As foon as the Bear felt the Stone, and law him,
'he turns about, and comes after him, taking devi~
liih long Strides, and ihufi'ling along at a firange
Rate, fo as wOuld put a Horfe to a middling Gal-
lop, away runs Friday, and takes his Courfe, as if
he run towards us for Help, fo we all refolv'd to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man 5
tho' I was angry at him heartily for bringing
the Bear back upon us, when he Was going about
his own Bufinefs another Way, and efpecially _I
was angry that he had turn'd the Bear upon us, and
then run away; and I call'd out, TouDog, faid I,
is this your making us laugh .3 Come away, and take your
Haifa, that we may [boot the Creature; he hears me,
and cries out, No jboot, no j/Joot, fland fill, you get
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Beafi's one, he turn'd on a fudden, on
one Side of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree,fit for
his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and dou-
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying
his Gun down Upon the Ground, at about five or
fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree. _.

The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we f0]:
' low'd at a Diflance, the firit Thing he did, he.
flopp'd' at the Gun, finelt to it, but'let it he, and
11p he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a- Cat,
tho' f0 monl'croufly heavy: I was amazd at the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not

for my Life fee any Thing to laugh at yet, till fee:
, mg
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rode nearer to
him. . ' ' ' ,

When we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb'of the
Tree, and the Bear got about half Way to him;
as foon as the Bear got out to that Part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, fays he to us,
7de you fie me teaches the Bear dance; f9 he falls a
jumping and {baking the Bough, at which the Bear
began to totter, but flood fiill, and began to look
behind him, to fee how he fl'lOUId get back; then
indeed- we did laugh heartily: But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal 5 when he fees him
fiand fiill, he calls out to him again, as if he had
fuppos'd the Bear could fpeak lmglz'jh; What, you
210 came farther .9 Pray you come farther; To he left
jumping and ihaking the Bough 5 and the Bear, juli:
as if hehad unde'rfiood what he faid, did come a -
little farther, the'n 11g, fell a Jumping again, and
the Bear fiopp'd again. ' "

We thought now was a good Timato knock him
on the Head, and Lcall'd to Friday to fiand [iii],
and we would {boot the Bear; but he cry'd out
earnefily, O pray! O pray! no flroot, me lhoot by and
than 5 he would have faid, 22y aml'hy. However, to
ihorten the Story, Friday danc'd f0 much, and
the Bear flood f0 tickliih, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but {'till could not imagine what
the Fellow would do, for firl'c we thought he de-
pended upon {haking the Bear OFF; and we found
the Bear was too cunning for that too; for he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings fafl with his great broad Claws and
Feet, fo that we could not imagine what would
be the End of it, and where the Jefi would be at

lafl.
But
, But. Friday put ,1 us out (sf-Doubt. quickly; for" -
feeing the Bear cling'faft to the Bough, and that
he would not be perfwaded to come any farther 5
IVell, well, fays Friday, you :20 come; farther, we go,
we go, you no come to me, me go come to you 5 and upon '
this, he goes out to the fmalleft End of the Bough,
where it would bend with his Weight, and gently
lets himfelf down. by it, flid-ing. down th6215011gh,
till he came nearenough to :jumP down on his Feet,
and away he run to his Gun, takes it up,'.and .
{lands fiill. ; . . g _ . '

>> Well, faid I to him, Friday,-What willyou do
now? Why don't you (boot him;> No flmot, fays

_ Friday, 910 yet, 'mefljoot'now, one nokill; me flay, give

, you one more Laugh! And indeed .fo he did, as. you
will fee prefe-nt-ly; for when the Bear fee his Ene-
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he
flood, but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind
him every Step, and comin backward till hegot
into the Body of the Tree 3 then with the fame
hinder End foremol'c, he come down the Tree,
grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a Time, very leifurely, at this June'ture, and hit-
hefore he could fet his hind Feet upon the Ground,
Friday flepp'd clofe to him, clapp'd the Muzzel. of
his Piece into his Ear, and that him dead as a
Stone. .

Then the Rogue turn'd about, to fee if we did
not laugh, andwhen he faw we were pleas'd by - '
our Looks, he falls a laughing himfelf very Ibud 5
So we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday -, fo you
kill them, fays I, why you have no Guns: No, '
fays he, no 0117:, but flJoot great 72'1qu long Arrow.

This was, indeed, a good Diverfion to us; but
we were {till in a wild Place, and our Guide very'
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew, the

deed, except the Noife I Once heard on the Shore
of Afi-z'ca, of which I have faid fomething'alrea'dy,
I never heard any thing that fill'd me with f0 much
Horrour. ' '

Thefe Things and the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had-us,
we {hould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monfl'rous Creature off, which was worth faving;
but we had three Leagues to go, 'and our Guide
haflen'd us; {'0 we left him, and went forward on
our Journey. -

' The Ground was fiill cover'd' with Snow, tho'
not [0 deep and dangerous as on the Mountains,
and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard after-.
wards, were .come down into the Foreft and plain
Country, prefs'd Inf-Hunger to feek for F ood; and
had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Villages,
.'wherethey furpri'z'd the Country People, kill'd a
great many of theiir'Sheep and Horfes, and fame
People too. - . i

We had one dangerous Place to pal's, which '
our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves

in the Country, we ihould fihd them there _, and .
this was in a finall Plain, furrounded with Woods .

' on' every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane,

which we were to path to get through the Wood,
"and then we. {liould come to the "Village where We

were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we

'enter'd the firfl WOod, and a little after Sun-fer,
when we came into the Plain. We met with no-.,
thing in the firl'c Wood, except, that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was' not above two
Furlongs over, we faw five great Wolves. croi's the
Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had

been in .Chace of fome Prey, and had'it in View,
A a they
they took no Notice of us, and, were gone, and I
out of our Sight in a few Moments .

Upon this our Guide, who, by the Way, was a
wretched fainthearted Fellow, bid us keep in a
ready Pofiure; for he believ'd there were more
' Wolves a coming.

We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us,
but we faw no more Wolves, "till we came thro'
that Wood which was near half a League, and en-
ter'd the Plain: As (hon as we came into the Plain,
-we had Occafion enough to look about us, the
firll Objcet we met with was a dead Horfe; that
is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolves had
kill'd, and at leaf't a Dozen of them at Work, we
could not fay eating of him, but picking of his
Bones rather, for they had eaten up all the Flelh
before.

We did not think fit to dil'turb them at their
Feal'c; neither did they take much Notice of us:
Pride would have let fly at them, but I would
not finder him by any Means, for I found we
were like to have more Bufinefs upon our Hands
than we were aware of. We were not gone half
over the Plain, but we began to hear the Wolves
howl in the Wood on our Left, in a frightful
Manner, and prefiently after we f'aw about a hun-
dred coming on direE'tly towards us, all in a Body,
and molt of them 111 a Line, as regularly as an
Army drawn up by experienc'd Officers. I fcarce
knew in what Manner to receive them; but found
to draw our felves in a clofe Line was the only
Way; fo we form'd in a Moment : But that we
might not have too much Interval, I order'd,
that "only every other Man lhould fire, and that
the others who had not fir'd fhould Rand ready
' to give them a feeond Volley immediately, if
they continued to advance upon us, and that then

thofe_ , _, ' E 3 55 l -

'thol'e who had fir'd at firf'c, lhould not prete'n'd'to
load their Fufee's again, but Hand ready with every
'one a Pillol, for we were all arm'd with a Fufee,
and a Pair of Pil'tols each Man, fo we were by
this Method able to fire fix Volleys, half of us at:
a Time; however, at prefent we had no Neceffi-
'ty 5 for upon firing the firf't Volley, the Enemy
made a full Stop, being-terrify'd as well with the
Noii'e as With the Fire; four of them being lhot
into the Head, dropp'd; feveral others were wound-
' ed, and went bleeding ofi', as we could fee by the
Snow: I found they ltopp'd, but did not immedi'
ately Retreat; whereupon remembring that I had
been told, that the fiercefl: Creatures were terri-
fy'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com-
pany to hollow as loud as we could, and I found
the Notion not altogether inil'taken, for upon our
Shout, they began to retire, and turn about, then
I order'd a fecond Volleyto he find in their Rear,
which put them to the Gallop, and away they
Went to the Woods.
' This gave us Leilhre to charge our Pieees again,
and that we might lofe no Time, we kept going;
but We had but little more than loaded our Fulees',
and put our felves into a Readinefs, when We heard
a terrible Noif'e in the fame Wood, on our Left,
only that it was farther o'nWard the fame Way we
'were to go. .' . ' .

The Night was coming on, and the Light he'-
gan to be 'd'uflty, which made it worfe on our Side:
But the Noife encreafing, We could eafily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe hel-
lilh Creatures , and on a fudden, we perceiv'd two
or three Troops of Wolves, one on our Left, one be:-
hind us, and one on our Front -, fo that We feem'd to'
he furrounded with 'em .3 however, as they did not
fall- tipbn us, we kept our Way forward, as fal't as

A a 2 We
We, could make oer Horfes go, which, the Way be.
ing very rough, was only a'gOOd large Trot; and
in this Manner we came in View of the Entrance
of a Wood, through which we were to pafs, at the
farther Side of the'Plain, but we were greatly fur-

" priz'd, when Corning nearer the Lane, or Pafs, "we-
faw a confu's'd'Number of Wolves [landing j'u'll at
the Entrance. _ - '

On a fudde'n, at another opening of the Wood,-
We heard the'Noife of a, Gun, and looking that
Way, out. rufh'd a Horfe, with a Saddle and a
Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and fixteen'
0r feve'nteen Welt/es after him, full Speed; indeed,
the Hare had the Heels of them, but as we fup'r
@311 that he could not hold it at that Rate, we
doubtedn'ot but they Would get up With him at lait,
and no quelti'on but they did. >>

. But here we had a nto'l'r' horrible Si'ht'; for rio'
ding up to the Entrance where the-Her e came out,
jive found 7the Carca'fs or another Horfe, "and of two
Men, 'dev'our'd by the ravenous CreatLIres, and one
of the Men was no doubt the fame who we heard
fir'd the Gun 3 'for there lay a Gun ju'f'c 'by him, 'fir'd '
off; but as to the Man, his Head and the upper
Part of his Body was eaten up; _
'- This fill'd us with Horror, and we knew not
What Courfe to take, but the Creatures refolv'd us
foon; for they gather'd about us prefently, in Hopes
of Prey, and I verily believe there were three hun--
dred Of them: It happen'd Very much to our Ads-
vantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but"
a little Way from it, there lay fome large Timber
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be
fore, and I firppolh'lay there For Carriage: I drew
my little Troop in among thofe Trees," and placing
Our felves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I ad-
vis'd'them all to light, and keeping that Treefbe:
, 'ore'
fore us, for a Bread-Work, to {land in a Trian-
gle, or three Fronts! enclofing our Horfes in the
Center. '

' We did f0, and it was well we did; for never
was a more furious Charge than the. Creatures
made upon us in the Place; they came on us with
a growling kind of a Noife (and mounted the Piece
of Timber, which, as I faid, was our Bread--Work)
as if they were only rnfhing upon their Frey; and
this Fury of theirs,'it feems, was principally occa-
fion'd by their feeing our Horfes behind us, which
Was the Prey they aim'd at: I order'd our Men to
fire as before, every other Man 5. and they took
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they ltill'd feveral
of the Wolves at the firfi: Volley 5 but there was a
Neceflity to keep a continual Firing -, for they
Carine on like Devils, thofe behind pulhing on thofe -
he ore.

When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of our Fu-
fees, we thought'they {topp'd a little, and I hop'd
they would have gone off; but it was but a Mo'-
ment; for others came forward again; fo we 191%
two Volleys of our Biftols, and I believe in thefe
four Firings, we had kill'd feventeen or eighteen of
them, and lain'd twice as many 5. yet they came on
2 am.

' gI was loath to fpend our lafi Shot too halftily5 {'0
I call'd my Servant, not my Man Friday, for he was
better employ'd; for with the greatefl: Dexterity
imaginable, he had charg'd my Fuf'ee and his
own, While we were engag'd; but as I laid, I call'd
my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
I had him lay aTrain, all along the Piece of Tim-
' ber,.and let it be a large Train: He did {'0, and had
but jail Time to get away, when the Wolves Came
up to it, and fome were got up upon it; when
lfiiapping an uncharg'd Pilinl clofe to the Pow-
"" are kg
Get, fet it on fire; thofe that were upon the T im.
her were fcorch'd with it, and fix or feven of them
fell, or rather jump'd in among us, With the Force
and Fright of the Fire, we dif'patch'kl thefe in
.an Inl'cant. and the ref'c'were fo frighted with the
Light, which the Night (for it was now very near
Dairk)1 made more terrible, that they drew hack
-a ltt e>> ' s '
Upon which I order-"d our lat} Pil'col to be fir'd
off in one Volley, and after that we gave a Shout;
upon this the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we fallydegd
immediately upon near twenty. lame ones, who
we found {tmggling on the'Ground, andfell a cut-
ting them with our Swords, which anfwer'd our
Expee'tation, for the Crying and Howling they
made was better underflood by their Fellows; {'0
that they all fled and left us. . ' '
We had, firl'c and lal'c, kill"d about threefcore
of them; and had it been Day-Light, we had
kill'd'many more. The'Field of Battle'heing thus
clear'd, we made forward again; for we' had {till
near a League to go. We heard the ravenous Crea-
tures howl and yell in the Woods as we went, fe-
veral Times, and fometimes we fancy'd we {aw
forne ot'them, but the Snow dazling' our Eyes,
we were not certain : So in about'an 'Ho'ur more,
we came to the Town where we were to lodge,

which we found in a terrible Fright, and all in
Arms; for it feetns, that the Night before, the
Wolves and fome Bears had broke into the Village,
and put them in a terrible Fright; and they were
ohlig'd to keep Guard Night and Day, but'efpeci-
ally in the Night, to preferve their Cattle; and
indeed their People. ' "

The next Morning our Guide was To ill, and his
Limbs fwell'd with the rankling of his two Wounds,
that he could go no farther; {'0 we were ohlig'd {9

tray, and no Snow, no Wolves, or any Thing like
them-,- hut when we told our Story at l'bolorafe, they
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Forefl at the Foot ol'the Mountains, efpeei-
all-y when the Snow'lay on the Ground : But they
enquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had gotten,
that would venture to bring .usthat Way in fuch
a fevere Seafon; and told us, it was very much
we were not all devour'd. When we told them how
we plae'd ourl'elves, and the Horfes in the Middle.
they blam'd us exceedingly, and told us it: was fifty
to one but we had been all dellroy'd 3 for it was the
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves f0 fu-
rious, feeing their Prey 3 and that at other Times
they are really afraid ofa Gun3 but the being ex-
cellive hungry, and raging on that Account, the
Eagemefs to come at the Horf'es had made them
fenf'elef's ofI)aiiger3 and that if we had not by the
.continull Fire, and at lafl by the Stratagem of'the
Train otPowder, mal'cer'd them, it had been great
Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces 3 where-
' as had we been content to have fat fiill on Horfe--
bask, and fir'd as l-lorfemen, they would not have
taken the Horf'es for f0 much their own, when Men
were on, their Backs, as otherwil'm and withal,
they told us, that at lal't, if we had flood altoge-
ther, and left our Horfes, they would have been
{0' eager to have devour'd them, that we might have
come of? fafe, ef'pecially having our Fire Arms in
out Hands. and being ['0 many in Number.

For my Part, I was never {'0 fenfible of Danger
in my Life3 for feeiug above three hundred Devils
cmne roaring and'open mouth'd to devour us, and.
having nothing to lhelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myfelf over for lift 3 and as it was, Ihelieve, I

I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in
my PafTage thro" France, nothing but what other
Travellers have given an Aeount of, with much
more Advantage than I can. I travell'd from Thou-
loufe to Paris, and without any confiderable Stay,
came to Collar}, and landed fate at Dover, the
fourteenth of firearm-y, after having had a fevere
cold Seafon to travel in. - .:

I was now come to the Center of my Travels,
and had in a little Time all my new difcover'd E-
itate fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
brought with me having been very cUrrently paid;

My principal Guide, and Privy Councellor, was
my good ancient Widow, who, in Gratitude for the
Money I had fent her, thought no Pains too much,
or Care too great, to employ fOI'lne; and 1 United
her to entirely with every Thing, that I was per-e
feetly eafy as to the Security of my Effects; and,
indeed, I was very happy from my Beginning, and
now to the End, in the unfpotted Integrity of this
good Gentlewoman.- . . ~

And now I began to think of leaving my Effects
with this Woman, and fetting'out for Li/eou, and
{0 to the Brafils-g but now another Scruple came in-
my Way, and that was Religion 5 for as I had en-.
tertain'd fome Doubts about the Roman Religion.
