;;_' ROEhfisaN CRUSOE.

HE that pretends to publiih to the world an
account of his own life and actions, is
doubtlefs under the firongeft obligations to
confine himfelf within the firifteil: rules of
modefly and truth: And this, I can allure the
publick, I molt folemnly determine to do in
the following narration.

I was born at York, in the year 1632, of a
reputable family. My father was a merchant,
born at Bremen ; his original name was
Kreutznaer, which for the fake of the Engliih
pionunciation, was afterwards changed into
Crufoe. My mother's name was Robinfon, a

native of the county of York; and for that
reafon I was called Robinfon, after her maid-
en name.

I was the youngefi of three brothers. The
eldefl; was an officer, and killed in the wars in
the Low Countries ; and the other I could
never learn any thing of. My father intend-
ing me for the law, particular care was taken
of my education . But all the pains and ex-
genie were to no purpofe; my inclinations

A a werewere bent another'way', and. nothing wou'fd
ferve my turn, butrat all hazards, I mulhgd to
iea. (r' ,_ Iffi' ' '

I'Jy father and mother were both'yi'ole'ntly
againft it, and ufed a thoufand arguments to
difi'uade me; but it was all to no purpofe ': My
refolutions were fo firmly .fettled, that neither
the intreaties of a molt tedderfiather; nor the
tears of an affeetion'ate 'mother,':c%u'ld make a-
nyimprei'fion upon mitt _._ i 4 '

I was then about nineteen years old, when
meeting with one of my {choolfellows at Hull,
who was going with his father, who was maf-
ter of a fl'llp, to London, I acquainted him
with my refolutions, and he readily promifed
me I {hould have a free pafIage, and be pro-
vided with all other necefl'aries-{uitable to the
voyage. Accordingly, without imp'loring a
blefiing of my parents, I tool; lhipping on the
firlt of September, 1651. ..

Our {hip was hardly got clear of the Hum-
ber, when we were overtaken by a 'violent 2,
Pcorm ; and, being extremely feafick, I began 'r
to refleft upon my father's good advice, and
the happinefs of a middle Rate of life which
he propofed to me 3 refolving, ifever I ihould
,be'fo happy as to {ct my feet again upon dry
land, that I would return to my parents, and g,
beg their pardon, and bid a final adieu to my 5'
wandering inclinations. '

Thefe 'wereimy thoughts during the ftorm .' ;
But that was no fooner over, but my good '5
refolutions decreated with'the danger, particu- '
Iarly when my companion, coming' to me, aik-
ed me if I was not a little frighted by the
fiorm, which as he exprefled it, was only a

turnout, fee what fine weather we have now,
and a'goed bowl of flunch will drown all
your pail forrows."

In lhort, the punch was made, and I got
fairly drunk, and then all my former refolu-
tions and notions of returning home vanil'ned.
I remained hotheaded feveral days, until I
was roufed up by an accident,that had very near
put a final end to my wandering refolutions.

Upon the fixth day,- we came to an anchor
in Yarmouth.road.where we lay windbound
with feveral other, veliels from Newcaflle;
but there being fafe anchorage, and our
lhip being tight, and our cables good,
the failors defpifed all dangers, and were as
merry in this flation as if they had been on
fliore. But on the, eighth day there arofe
l'uch a firong gale of wind as prevented our
riding up the river, which {till increafing, our
{hip rode forecafile in, having {hipped {everal
large feas.

it was not long before a general horror feiz-
ed the leamen; and I heard the mailer cry,
Lord have mercy upon us, we {hall all be loll!
For my part, I kept my cabin, very fick, till
the dreadful apprehenfions of fudden death
made me come upon deck, and there I was ter-
ribly affrighted indeed;

The fea went mou'ntains high, and nothing
was to be expeeted but unavoidable defiruc-
tion. Two of the {hips had already cut their
malls by the board ; two more had loll their
anchors, and were forced-out to the mercy of
the temgefr 3 ,and we, to fave our lives, were

forcedK

s 120.23 I'NS'ON

forced to cut away both "' oiirlforer'nafl: and

mainmaft.

It is ealy to judge the condition I was in,
who being but a frefh water failor, was in a far
worfe'cafe than any of them. Our {hip was
' very ftrong, but, as I underflood by them, too if

heavy laden, which made the failors cry out,
She would founder. '

The {torm continued extremely violent;
and in the middle of the night I could hear

fome crying out, " That the {hip had fprung a -

leak ;" others," That therewas four feetwater
in the hold." I was ready to give up the ghofi'.
through fear, when on a fudden all hands

were called to the pump, and I among the
tell.

 

VVhilfl; We were all in this confufion and l

difitrefs, the mailer happened to efpy fome,'

light colliers, and fired a gun asa fignal of our '

milery. I was not then a failor good enough -;

to know the meaning of the gun ;- but I foon
underflood it was a token of ourextreme dan- _=
ger, andl mull freely own it is impofiible fork

me to defcribe the agonies I laboured under.

nick of time to Our aififiance. . _

It. wasnot without a great deal of danger
and difficnl'ty' that they recovered their: own

that I had takenthis voyage only for a trial,
in order to proceed farther abrOad hereafter.

your eyes'; and perhaps our misfortune may,
in Tome meafure be owing to you. Pray (add-.1;
ed he) tell me truly upon what motiVe ,you'i"
'firflz undertook this voyage." U on this If;
told him the. whole; at'the';endpofwhiChfj
he broke out into the following exclamation :2:

" Oh, ye eternal powers ! whatgreat ofi'ence
have I committed, that 'I fhould take fuc'h ail
defperate, abandoned Wretch into my 'fhip, that}
has brought all thefe 'miferies-and' misfortuneejfi

upon me !" After his' pallion' was 'a little a-_
bated, proceeded--" Youn'g man, depend upon.g

with'nothing but ruin'an'd'difafier, until your

{0 he leftme'. ? . . ' ;' ' "
, And now again I had {ome notion o'fireturn-g,
ing home : But that Was'quickly'overruled by;
a foolilh' opinion,that if 1 did, my neighbours

firange is the nature 'of' youth, that though;

In {hort, I made'the bell: of my way to Lone-J

to carry with me what merChandife I {hould
think lit, and todifpofe of 1t to my own advan-
ta 6. .

g1 was wonderfully pleafed with this kind
offer, and concluded that now I had an op-
portunity of making my 'fortune, deg and in or-
der to my voyage I {cut to my friends for
fome money to fit me out , who accordingly
remitted me forty pounds, which I laid out in
goods according to his direetions. He taught
me. to keep a journal, and feveral of the moi}
ufeful parts of navigation. And indeed, by
his afliftance and my own indufiry y, in this
voyage I became both a failor and a merchant.

Part of this voyage I was exceflively lick of
a calenture, oceafioned by the heat of the cli-
mate, being in the latitude of almOi't 15 de-
grees north of the line. However, I recover-
ed, and managed my little {took {0 Well, that
I brought over with me five pounds and nine

ounces of gold duft, which produced at Lon-

don near three hundred pounds Iterling.
Soon after my return, my good friend the
captain died. Although this was a very great

grief to me, yet I refolVed to go another voy-

age with his mate, who had got. the command
of the Ihip. 1 This voyage proved a very un-
faccefsful one. I carried with me about one
hundred pounds, and left the red with the

captain' s ,widow, and {o to [ca we went. , But

as we were failing towards the Canary iflandsm

we found we were chafed by a- Salee rover,

who in fpite of all the fail we could make, in
a ihort time came up with us ;' and now there
was no remdegdy but to fight or. be taken. ,

They had 18 guns, and our {hip but 12;?
however,"ab'out three in the afternoon, we
Came to an engagement; "Many were killed'
on both {ides ; but at length being overpower-
ed by their numbers, we were forced to inbmit
and all carried into Salee. Our men were
fent to the Emperour's court to be fold ; but
the captain of the pirate, taking a particular.
liking to me, kept me for his oWn fiave.

_ It was in this miferable condition that my,
father's words came afrefh' into my remems-
brance, and my thoughts Were continually at:
work to make my efcape. My patron en~SS
trul'ted me with the management of his garden;
and houfe ; and indeed I was not without?
hopes but at fome time or other an opportunifi
Vty might offer. The worfl: of it was, I had'
no mortal to communicate my thoughts to ;Z,
and fo for two years, I could find nothing 1
practicable. ;_

In length of time, I found my patron was.
grown fo poor, that he could not fit out his"
fhip as ulual; and then he ufed confiantly;
once or twice a week to go out a fiihing, tak--i
ing me and a Morifco boy to row the boat ;:
and fo much pleafed was he with mydexterity'
in filhing, that he would often [end me with a?

.Moor, his kinfman, and the boy, to catch {1th
for him. _ .

One morning as we were at the fport; there
arofe fo thick a fog that we loft our way, and."
rowing all night, when it. was light we found.
ourfelves at leaf'c two league 'in the ocean ;'
however, we made a ihift to get on lhore.
But, to prevent the like misfortune for the fuc-
turc, my patron. ordered a carpenter to pplld 9>>.

"'--'__"_"' rifeCRVUS'O E. :3

little {late room in the middle of the long
boat, with a place behind to. fieer, and othe '
conveniences to keep out the weather.

In this he would often take us out a fiihing;
and one time particularly, he invited three or
four perfons of diltinetion to go along with
him, and made extraordinary preparations for
their entertainment : Providing alfo three fu-
zees, with a fufiicient quantity of powder and
fliot, that they might have fome {port at fowlinq,
as they pafl'ed along the ihore. The next morn-
ing the boat being in readinefs, on a fudden "
their minds altered. However, my patron
ordered us to go and catch a difh of fifh ; for
that he was refolved his guefts {hould fup with
him. '

And now it was that I began to think ofmy
deliverance; and in order to it, I perfuaded
the Moor to. get fome provifions on board,
and alfo fome powder and {hot to {hoot cur-
lews, which were very plenty in thofe parts.
I took care to provide privately whatever elfe
I could think was the molt neceflary for the
prefent expedition, refolving to make my ef-
cape, or perifh in the attempt. '

When we were pai'c the cafile, we fell to
fifhing, and I {tood farther into the fea ; and
when we were got at leaft a league, I gave the
boy the helm, and feized Muley by furprife,
and/threw him overboard : " Muley {laid I)"
I" never defigned you any harm, and feel;
nothing but my redemption ; I know you are
able to fwim to {hore ; but if yer; offer to
follow me, that very moment I will {hoot'iyou
through the head :" Upon which he infiantf

B ly14.ROBIN801V

1y turned about, and I make no doubt but he
got fafe to fhore.

 

This aEtion frighted the poor boy exceed-i
ingly ; however, I foon eafed him of his fear,
by telling him " if he would be a good boy,:'
and {wear by Mahomet, and the beard of his:
father to ferve me faithfully, I would be very .
kind to him." The poor child feemed wonoj
derfully pleafed with my promife, and readily?
confented ; and from that time I began to
love him entirely. 5'

We purfued our voyage, keeping {till on:
the Barbary coafl ; but in the dull; of the}
evening, I changed my comic, fieering diref't-- ,
ly S. and by E. that we might always be near:
the {hore ; and having a-pleafant gale, I found:-
the next day, by three in the afternoon, we;
were 150 miles beyond the dominions of the:
emperor of Morocco; yet {till I was under;
dreadful apprehenfions of being retaken. {

I continued failing for five days togetherJl
until I concluded that if any vefl'el was in pur-flf

{nit of me, 1 was go: {0 far to the fouthgvard;
' ' t at .
that they would not think proper to follow
me any farther.

After all this fatigue, I anchored in the
mouth of a little river; but where I knew '
not, neither could I fee any people to make
the difcovery. What I chiefly wanted was
freih water, which I refolved to go on ihore
to find out as foon as it grew dulkifh: But no
foonerdid it begin to grow dark, but we heard
Inch howlings and yellings of wild beafls and
monfiers, that I mufi needs own I was exceed-
1y terrified.

Poor Xury pafiionately begged me not to
go on {hore that night. The boy .had a great
deal of wit ; for which, and fome broken
Engliih which he had learned among the cap--
tives of our nation, I was mightily pleafed
with him. Neverthelefs, the howlings, and
bellowings were {0 dreadful that we had but
little tell: that night 3 and to add to our confu-
fion, we difcovered one of the monfters
making towards us ; upon which I took up
one of my guns and {hot at him, whether I hit
him or not, I cannot fay--but be made towards
the there, and the noiie of my gun increafed
the {tupendous noife of other monfiers.

The next morning I refolved to go on lhore,
and at all hazard: get fome frefh water.
The poor boy would 'have taken one of the
iars and fetched fome ; but I refufed, tell-
'ing him we would both go together and
take the fame fate ; and accordingly we took
our arms, and twojars for water, and away
we went.

I did not go out of fight of the boat for fear

the {avages fhould come down the river in

3' the-ire canoes, andl'take, it away -, but the berg
5 {eeing a vale a little farther, ventured-to. it,.,,-;

2 and returning with precipitation, I thought-iii
that he was either purfu'ed by the {avages orig
fome wild heafi ; upon which I ran towards 5;
him, refolving to perifh, or preferve him :1};
but as lie/came nearer to me, I {aw a creature}:
hanging at his back, like one-of our haresfg;
but fomething larger, which proved to be good
and wholefome meat, and what added mph: to '5
ourjoy, the boy affured me that there wast;
plenty of frefh water in the very creek where f;

the boat lay. . , ~ ,

In this p1aC/e I' began to c'o'nlider that then-"jg
Canary iflands and Cape de 'Verd could notg';
be far of? ; but having no inftrument, I knew ,
not in what latitude. We were, or when toff-
Rand off to fee for them. My hopes were to 2'"
meet {omeaof the Englilh trading Veffels, that 23'
Would confequently take us in, and relieve us.

The place Inwas in was dou'htlefs that wild
uninhabited country. that lies between-the em-
peror of Morocco's dominions and the ne-i'
groes ;. itabou'nds with wild beafts of all'forts,
and the Moors ufe it for hunting. From this g":
I thought I/fgnr;t mount Teneriffe in the Ca-'i'i.

way; but was as foten drifian back, and coma-1;;

not favour'me in this, my next refolution was
to feel: for the iflands, and venture myzrelf a-' 1
mong the Negroes ; for without one of thefe, '
I could have no other profpeet but llarving.

As we were failing pretty near the fhore,
we could difcover feveral people upon it,
looking after us. We could perceive they
were blacks, naked and unarmed, all except
one, Who had fomething in his hand like a
flick, which Xury told me was a lance, with
which they could kill at a great diflance. I
was inclinable to have gone on there, but Xu-
z'y cried "' No, no." However, I drew as
new to the {bore as _I could, and talked to
them by figns, till I made them {enfible I
wanted {omething ; they made figns to me to
flop my boat, whillt two of them ran up into
the country, and in lcfs than half an hour
brought me two pieces of dry flefh, and form:
corn, which we kindly accepted ; and to
prevent any fears, they laid it down, and
went and "seed at a diltancc till we had fetch-
ed it on board, and-then came clofe up to us
again.

But while we were returning thanks to
them. being all we could afford, two mighty
creatures came from the mountains in purl'uit
of each other; they palled the negroes with
great fwiftnefs,andjumped directly into the tea,
wantonly {wimming about, as if the water had
put a {top to their fury. At left one of them
coming nearer to the boat than I defired, I tool:

one of my guns and let fly at him and killed

gun; nor their furprife at feeing the creature
fiain by it. I made figns to them to draw it
out of the water by a rope, which they ac-
cordingly did ; and then I perceived it to be
abeautiful leopard, which made me- defirous
of the {kin ; and the Negroes being no lefs
defirous of the flefh, I freely gave it them.
As for the other (which was iikewife a leop-
ard) it made back to the mountains with
prodigious fwiftnefs. _

The Negroes having furniihed us with-the
belt provifions that the nature of the country
and circumfiances would "allow, I took my
leave of them ; and in eleven days fail I came
in fight of Cape de Verd, or thofe iflands that
go by that name 3 but could not by any means.
reach either of them. Upon whichI grew ex~
tremely dcjeEted ; when Xury (with a fort of
terror) cried out, " lViaPtro, Maf'tro, a great
ihip with a fail I" I foon perceived the was
a Portuguefe, and, as I conjeetured, bound to
Guinea for Negroes ; upon which I firove all
1 could to come up with them; but all my
{triving had beenin vain, if they had not hap-
pened to efpy, and fhortened their fail to flop
for me. - ,

Encouraged by this, I {at up my ancient,
and fired a gun, -both as fignals of diflrefs;
upon which they kindly lay to, till I came up
with them. It happened there was a Scotch
i'ailor on board, to whom I made my cafe
known ; and then/ they took me into their
ihip.

You may we'll imagine my joy was exceed-
ingly great for this unexpeeled deliverance 3.
efpecially when I found the captain 3:" the

' We arrived at the bay of All Saints, after;
22 days fail. The good man would not take:

At firlt, I laid upon it all the boards I could ;
get, and then I lowered down three of the lea-.5;
men's chelts, and filled them with provifions of
ail forts. , I found c'lothes enough, but then I:
took no more, than my prefent occafion rec;
quired.

My concern was chiefly upon tools to work.
with, and fire arms and ammunition ; and ac-
cordingly I found in my fearch, the carpenter's
chelt, and in the great cabin fome fire arms and '
ammunition, all which I put on board my

raft _: and {0-, with two broken oars, &c. I put
to (ea; -

Though every thing at firit [cemed to favour ;
my dcfign, yet after I had failed about a mile, I
found ona fudden the forepart of my raft run
aground, {0 that it was with the greateft diflie-
culty imaginable I kept my cargo tight togeth-
er ; and indeed if I had not been extremely dil-
igent and careful, all had been loft and funk ine
- to the {ca : But after Tome time, Providence fo
Ordered it, that at the rifing of the'water my
raft floated again, and lo I happily landed myi

Returning afterwards to my raft, I got my

goods on there; and being very much afraid of
the wild bealts, I made a fort of fence or barri~
cade about it, which I thought might in fome
meafure {ecure me againfl the dangers I was
apprehenfive of, and [0 that night I {leptvcry
comfortably, and the next morning when I
awaked, I refolved to go again to the {hip to get
{uch other neceflaries in as 1 had molt occa-
fion for, "before another {torm came, when I
knew {he mufl; be dafhed to pieces.
' In order to this {econd expedition, I mended
my raft where I found it defeetive, and brought
away from the {hip a great many other tools,
clothes, ammunition, and whatever elfe I
thought molt neceiiary for my future preferva-
tion and fubfii'cence. 'Then I made-haft'e to
Ihore, fearing the wild beafls might come 'and
devour what I had already landed.

When I had landed all the {econd cargo, I
fell immediately to Work 'to make me a little
tent, and fortified it in the bell. manner I could,
to {ecure myfelf as much as polfible againlt any
fudden attempt either from man or beait. Af-
ter this, I charged my fire arms, blocked up the
doors, and laid the bed I had brought from the ,
{hip upon the ground, and flept as comfortably
as thOugh I had been in my native country.

But fiill the th0ughts of my future {ubfifience -'
and prefervation were uppermoflz in my mind ;
and therefore I went to the {hip as often as poi-
fible, and brought away every thing I thought
could be of any ufe deg, and indeed had f0 {tored
myfelf, that I judged I was tolerably provided
for for a confiderable time.

W it drag a pyovidential thing happenea;yet it was four years before I could eat any bail"

ley bread, and much longer before I had an"
benefit from my rice. After this, with indefat'

igable care and induf'try, I finiihed my. wall
' ordering it {0 that I had no way to go into In
fortrefs but by a ladder. i
April 16. I finifhed my ladder, and wet:
up it, and pulled it after me, as I always did:
and, in truth had {0 well fortified mylelf, tha
I was as I thought, indifferently Well fecure
' againfl: any furprife ; neverthelefs as I Was on

a fudden earthquake, that the roof of my lit

came tumbling down upon my head ; upo
which, with the greatefi: amazement, I ran 't
my ladder, and got out of my cave, and {a
the top ofa vaPt rock fall into the fea, an'
expefted every moment the whole ifland woul
be fwallowed up. i
In this affrig'n-t I remained for form momen'
till I perceived the fury of the motion began
abate ; but it was not long before I was and
new apprehenficns, on account of a violent te '_
pelt that attended it. This dreadful fiorm coi:
tinned for about three hours, and then followe
fuch a heayy rain, that my tent was quite ove

vers other ptcces of the 1111;), wh1cE--1 the via-1

the f'nip, thrown by the tempel't, very near
the Ihore, and refolved to get to her as {con as
1 cool !;d but at that time 1 found it imprao'
ticzole. '

I continued to work upon the wreck till the
21111, and every day recovered {omething that;
would be of ufe to me, and got togetner {0 ma-
ny planks, and f0 mucn iron, mad and other
neceffaries, that, ifl had had tools and fit .,H I
m:g}1t have bu.lt me a bc-at ; whtch was a
thing I very much wanted.

june -.16 As I Was {trolling towards the (ea,
.1 found a large mule- . The 17111 I {pent in
cookmg it: I found 1n her 70 eggs, and the
flefh the mo!1 1 delzcious meat that ever I tafied.
The181h, I flayed within the wnole day, there
being a contxhual rain, with fiorms of wind
and 11ghtn1z1g.

Prion the 19111113 the 27th of june, I was
.very i1ck,and had 5311 a terrabie ague, 11111th:
often heId me for nttse or ten hom's w-th exc.
tre1nevio'1er1ee. 011 the 18111, I began to re-
cove r 'a 11113:, but' was very reitfei's in 11.6

make me refleEt that thejufiice of God follow-W
'ed me, and that feyere puniihment was jufkg};
Iy owing to my difobcdience and wicked life}?

June 28. I flept retry well mofi part of}
the night, which regeihed me very much .3;
In the morning I ate a bifcuit and drank fame"
water mixed With rum; I boileda piece of:
goat's fle'lh for my dinner, but ate very little;
and at night I {upped upon three of my tur-J'
.tle's eggs; "after {upper-I attempted to walla}?
out with my gun, but found myfelf too weak,';
and .fo returned to my habitation. ,;

Here confcience flew in my face, re'prehend"
ing me as a blaiphemer and a reprohate 3?.
for faying in my agonies, " What have I
done to be difiinguifhed in all this fcene of:
.mifery."--Methought I heard a voice anfwerg'i'
ing me, " Ungrateful wretch ! Dare you aflgi
i'what you have done ? Look upon your pal},
life, and then afk thyfelf, why thou wafl; not:
dtowned in Yarmouth road, or killed by the:
Sallee Rovers ? Why not devoured by wild!
beafls in the defarts of Africa, or drownedf
altere' with the reit of thy companions F" *3.

Struck dumb by thele fevere reflections, and;
fearing the return of my ague, I began at;
length to confider what was mol': proper to be
done, to free myfelf from this difiemper ; and;
having heard that the Brazilians ufe tobaccqf
for mofl: of their difeafes, I refolved to try this
experiment. cl

I tried feveral ways with the tobacco : F irft'

I took a leaf and chewed it, which made'me;

ed it in- rum, refolving to take a good dole Of
it when I went to bed, and then 1 put tome
into a pan and burnt it, holding my nofe over
the fmoke as long as I could endureit Without
fuffocating. After thefe feveral operations I
fell into a fweat and flept quietly and well for
thirteen or fourteen hours; and when I got
upin the morning I found my fpirits revived,
my {tomach much better, and I grew exceed-
ingly hungry, which I had not been for fame
time paft : In ibort, I milled my fit the next
day, and found that I every day grew ltronger
and better.

The 30th I ventured out with my gun, and
killed a fowl not much unlike a brandgoofe,
but did not eat of the flefh, choofing rather to
dine upon two or three more of,my turtle's
eggs. In the evening I renewed my medi-
cine: Notwithfianding which, I had a little
fpice of my fit the next day ; and therefore, on
the 2d of july, I took my medicine as I did at
firlt; and on the 14th,.which was the day I
expcfied the return of my fit, the ague left:
me, which was no {mall joy to me; and inde
the goodner of God On this occafion, afi'eet
me to {enfibly that I fell on my knees and re-
turned thanksin a molt devout and folemnman-
ner.

July 4. I walked out with my gun : But my
dil'temper having reduced me very low, I could
go but a little way at a time ; for, the experi-
ment having weakened me exceedingly, I was a-
ble to walk but a very 'fhort way at once. I

' - My feed being thus increal'ed, my next care
a" was to prepare more land to row it in; and ac--
i' cordingly I fixed upontwo large plats on the

,g {end it from the vermin. , t
11:. In Ihort, my corn increafed to that degree,

1.; .1 to {utmount at lait; and {0, as invall other e.>>

worth 40001. fiterling ; with which, as regga-
as poffible, I refolved to make the belt ofmjf
way to England; and by the advice ofih'e
Captain, I was perfuaded to'go by land,"
which had like 'to have proved fatal to file
and all that were in my company; for 'the
{news being fallen, the wolves and beafe'
were driven out of the woods, and though
there were more than 29 of us together, they
{ct upon us many times, and indeed, it was
not without the gr'eateft hazard and difficult}'

that bevond my expectation, I found myfglf

a

We preferved ourfelves from being devoure ,
the particular relation of which would be the
long to trouble the reader with. eg

In our farther paiTage' through France;
we met with nothing uncommon'or remarlii
able ; we got fafe to Paris, and after a {he};r
{tay there, went to Calais and landed at Dov'ei
the 14th of january in a very cold fe'afon. 255'

VVhen I came to London, I found my bills
of exchange all arrived, and the money ready
to be paid at fight, which when I had receivw:
ed, it came into my mind to return to Lifbofi;
and from thence to the Brazils, to look after
my plantation ; but upon fecond thoughts",
I concluded it befi: to fell it, and on this ac:
count I thought it proper to write to my cor;
.refpondent at Lifbon, and defire his advic'e'~
and afiiftance, who readily gave me his prom?
ife to do all he could for me ; and in truth 7a?
I afterwards found he acquitted himfelf to m'e
in every particular, with the greatefijufiicie
and integrity. ' 4;

In {hort, he fold my eftate for me to the

bef': advantage, and remitted to me {oriit
b11153;

"I,c R U S ope . 85

bills for three hundred and twenty pieces of
eight, afum much greater than I expected,
And now I began to think it high time to
fettle myfelf, Providence having 'made fuch a
plentiful provifion for me that I wanted noth--
ing to make myfelf as happy as I could will-x.

Having call: my anchor, and for the pref-
ent bid adieu to all foreign adventures, I
had no other care or concern upon me but
the education of my brother's two fans. One
of them I bred a gentleman, and the other I
bred an able failor; and foon afterwards I
married a virtuous young gentlewoman, of a
good family, by whom I had two fons and
a daughter ; but, {be dying, I grew difco'nfo--
late and melancholy, and at the inltigation
of my nephew, refolvedlI would once more
make a voyage to the Eafiindies, which} did
in the year 1694, and in my pallage vifited my
Ifland. A full and particular account of
which I intend 'lhall be the fubjcfl: of the fab-
fequent parts of my narrative.

g,

0U may remember, fir, you {cut me on"
a voyage; and indeed, I was not a little" 5
lurprifed to find, at my return, that you had;
left us. We had a very good paliage; and inglg
deed, my countrymen were overjoyed to find IE
had {0 miraculoufly efcaped; and- when I had

{hewed the arms and ammunition which I had i.
brought, they were tranfported to the highcfifg-
degree. After a little flay, we got what wef':
could from the ravages, made hold with two ofgi

we found the Engliflrmen had quarrelled with'glj
one another, and had attempted to murder andilgif
deftroy their fellows, and were often very nearfi
putting their wicked praftices in execution. PS31
. One day it happened, that as two of mypi:
Spaniards were in the woods, one of the {0:143
bereft of the Englilhmen came 'up to them, and}
made heavy complaints how cruelly they were; T
ufcd by their countrymen, and that if we didi',
'not take them under our proteetion and givef'efi'
them afliflance, they muft inevitably be flawedfi
and undone. When they came to (upper, one's'g

of the Spaniards, in a gentle and friendly man-v '

O1

ner, began to reprimand the mutinous Englilhgfief"
men : That it was a great Pity their countrymen--i

fuller their 'cOuntrymen to- procure their {uh-
fifience without farther dif'turbance ; to which
they replied, Let tltemfla'rve and be ddmn'd, for
{he efland is ours, and if they will not workfor us,
1hr): fialt' have 910 flmre in it. Come jack (laid
Atkins) mlwflaall dare to buzld in our dominion:
wither: our cory'ent .9 And as we afterwards
found out, they had certainly murdered them,
if they had not been prevented : However,
they pulled down their huts, and did them all '
the damage they poflibly could. When they
had done this villany, they came back to the
Game, {mailing of what they had 'done; when
one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat, twirled it
round, faying, And you 'Signior jack Spaniard _
flmfl have thefameflwce if youdo not mendyt'mr
; runner . This quarrel in a {hlort time grew {0
' ' high, that if we had not timely inte'rpofed and
' taken aWay' their arms, in all probability th'ere
' had been murder. -

' Thefe 'wicked fellows, perceiving that they
had made all of us their enemies, began to-re-
lent, and to beg for their arms, 'but this we pof-
{itively refufed, which made them {0' mad and
defperate, that they left 'us in the greatefl; pal"-
{ion imaginable. They were hardly gone 'but
their two countrymen came to us With their
complaints, telling us they were mined; and
truly fir, we could \not help thinking it very
hard, that nineteen of ' us fhohld, from time to
time, be bullied and inlulted by three fuch no-
torious villains. ' / ' ' "

their way of fighting. _ '

We were undoubtedly, fir, in a great con-
fiernation, lell: they {hould run into our grove,
and de'ltroy what we. had, and f0 refolved to
put ourfelves upon Our defence, and {hoot the
firlt that lhould approach ; and as we appre-
hended, {o it happened; for three of the army
that was vanquilhed, came direetly to the place
for lhelter ; but thefe [ would not fuller to be
'flain, but had them {urprifed and taken "alive :
And in truth, they all proved very excellent
fervants, and were of great ufe to us afterwards.
The two'pa'rties being gone off, and the coafl'
clear, we went to the place of battle, where
we found two and thirty dead upon the (pot, '
with feveral bows and arrows, and other forts
of weapons, which I ordered to be carefully
picked up and carried into our armoury.

This difmal fpeEtaele had that effeel: ' upon.
the three troublefome Englilhmen, that much
of their turbulent temper began to abate, and
they began to be good friends, and to tht'nk '
unanimoufly what was bell: to be done for our
mutual {ecu rity and prefervation.-- And, accord-
ingly, all hands were at work to {trengthen
the fortifications of our Cattle, and provide a'
proper fecurity for all our provifions; and in-
deed, we did both with all the caution that the '
nature of our circumfiances would allow. And-
thus for two years we lived in a very comforta-
ble retirement, having neither [em or heard
any thing of the ravages for all flat time.

But now there happened another quarrel,
which might have proved of very bad confe-
quence, if it had not been prevented in time.

guns with {mall lhot, and to bring them to f

cleared, we were in all points prepared for an
engagement. _

We ftood out to fea, but {till the boats fol-
lowed us very clofe. We could perceive the
two foremoft were Englilh, which were ahead
of the Dutch by two leagues: Hereupon we
fired a gun, and hung out a flag of truce, in or- I
der for a parley ; but finding they bore down 1
upon us with all the fail they could, we fired 1
upon them with' balls, and then bade them i
keep off at their peril. But all this {ignified 'l
nothing ; for, depending upon their numbers, I
they were abfolutely bent upon mifchiefl We '1
made feveral {hots at them as they came for' '!
ward, killed feveral of their men, and funk ,
one of their. boats, and manning out our pin- 1
nace, we faved three of their'men from drown-
ing, who were brought on board. After a
very hot action, we got out fo far to {ca that-
they could not purfue us without danger ; and
fo, changing our courfe to the ealtward, we
got quite out of the courfe of European 'fhips.

V'Yhen We were got out to fea, inquiring
more particularly into the meaning of all this,
the Dutchmen let us into the whole fecret,
telling us, that the fellow we haught the {hip
of, was an arrant'thief, and that he ran away
with the {hip ; that the Captain was treacher-
ou-fly murdered, and that he and four more
were forced to the woods for fafety ; and that,
at length, by means of a Dutch vell'el in its
way to China, that came in accidentally te

farther told us, that they were informed that?
the fellow fold the {hip at Bengal, and {he w'a'i: i;

inquired what {hips were in the road, and how
matters flood ; and indeed this prudent fiep
was the occafien of our happy deliverance;
for the next morning there came in two Dutch

"firm, and a third without any colours; and

in the evening two Engliih ones.

The river where we lay was but fmall, and
the country wild and barbarous, and the in-
habitants, all robbers, having no correfpond-
ence with any other nation 3 and among oth-
er barbarous cuftoms, they have this particu-
larly ; when any {hip is driven on their coalt,
they immediately feize her, and make all her
men fiaves ; fo that here we {Sund ourfelves
furmunded with enemies, both by {ea and
land.

As we found our fhip was very foul and
leaky, we thought to cleanfe her in this place ;
but while this was doing, the inhabitants, who
I believe, had never feen a' {hip upon the ca-
reen before, and not perceiving our men, who
were at work, prefently imagined that the {hip
had been cart away, and lay u on the ground;
and accordingly they furroundped us with five
or fix large boats full of armed men, with a
refolurion to plunder, the fhip, and carry the
men away flaves to their king : But, when

'they {aw our men at work upon the-outfide of

the {hip they looked upon us with the greatefl:
confulion imaginable ; neither could we im-
agine whatltheir defign was: However to
prevent the worft, we handed down {ome
arms, and indeed it was well we did, for in
his than a quarter of an hour, they came
{coating upon us with all their force.

0f the jrrrfcnt State of Religion 2'72 t/zefl'orla'.

DOUBT, indeed, there is much more devo-

tion than reiigion in the world, more ado-
ration than fupplication, and more hypocrify
than fincerity : And it is Very melancholy to
confide'r, what numbers of people there are
furnilhed with the powers of reafon and the
gifts of nature, and yet abandoned to the grofll
efl; ignorance and depravity. But it would
be uncharita'ole for us to imagine, (as fome Pa-
pifis abounding with too much ill nature, the
only {caudal to religion, do) that they will
certainly be in the Rate of damnation after
this life 1' For how can we think it coniifient
with the mercy and goodnefs of an infinite be:
ing, to damn thofe creatures, when he has not,
furnilhed them with the light of his gofpel ?
Or how can fuch proud, conceited and cruel

higots prefcribe rules to the jufiice and mercy
of God ?
We are told by fome peeple, that the great
image which King A'cr'mr/zadnezzar let up to be
adored by his peoPlc, held the reprefentation
of the fun in his right hand, as the principal
obje& of adoration. But to wave this dil'courle
of Heathens, How many {elfcontr-adifiing
principles are held among Chriftlans? And
how do we doom one another to the devil,
while all profefs to worthip the lame Deity,
and to expeel; the fame falvation !

When I was at Pom/gal there was held at
that time the court ofjultzce ofthe inquifition.
All the criminals were carried in proccflion to
the great church ; where eight of them were
habited in gowns and caps of canvas, whereon
the torments of hell were dil'played, and they
were condemned and burnt for crimes againfl:
the Catholick faith and Blefled Vir in.

I am lorry to make any refleftions upon
Chrifiians ; but indeed in Italy the Romg'flz rc-
ligion feerns the molt cruel and mercenary up-
on earth : And a very judicious perfon, who
travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells us,
" That there is only the face, and outward
pomp of religion there ; that the church pro-
teets murderers and affaihns, and then delivers
the civil magifirates over to Satan for doing jui-
tice ; interdiets whole kingdoms, and {huts up the
churches for want of paying a few ecclefiaflick
dues, and {o puts a flop to religion for ~mint of
their money : That the Court of Inquifition
burnt two men for {peaking dilhonourably of
the Blefl'ed Virgin, and the miflionaries of
China tolerated the worlhipping the devil by
their new converts : That Itaey, was the theaa

tre,_ where religion was the grand Opera ; and
, - ' thatRage players." . ,_ _ ,
