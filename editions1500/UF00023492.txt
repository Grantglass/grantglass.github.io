r.WAS My fiuher. having '

gained a handsome fortune by honest trade, gave me 3 good
education, and when I grew old enough, wished me to devote my-
self to some profession, but my mind was set on a see-firing life; and
at length, bowing mn ewny from home, I set sail in a ship bound for
London. But alter many perils, our ship was wrecked in tho Yar-
mouth Roads.
1 then unveiled on foot. to London, where I met with a Guinee
tmdet, whom I agreed to join in his speculation: and voyages. At
first, we were very succemful; but in my second expedition we were

chased by a Moorish lover, captured. and taken prisoneu'to Sauce.

Hence, however, I managed to escape in a fishing-heat, and was happy
enough to hall a Porwgcse vessel, whose captain kindly took me in.
l was, however, soon persuaded to make another voyage to the
African coast, in search of negroes. Another shipwreck was, alas!
to be my lot: a violent hurricane arose, the ship struck on a rock, and
throwing a boat over the ship's side, the crew got into her, hoping to
escape. But the rolling waves soon overturned the boat, and we
were all separated in the sea: as for me, I was carried by a wave to-
wards' the shore, and at length, left upon the land. more dead than
alive. When I recovered, I found myself quite alone, on what ap-

peared to be a tlmort Hand; a sense of loneliness, mingled with
'33

gratitude for my preservation, came over me, and kneeling down,l
thanked God for His mercy in saring my life, and implored Ilim to
help and support me for the time to come; then I set myself with all
due diligence to secure all I could for my comlhrt and safety. Iieing
almost consumed by intense thirst, I first went in search of some
water; I then climbed up into a tree, where I slept soundly until
morning. On awaking, I saw that the tide had so far gone down as
to let me come within a quarter of a mile of the ship; so being a good
swimmer, and anxious to possess myself of all the useful nrlielesl
could, I swam to the vessel, and got into her. I was thankful to find
the provisions were dry; and being very hungry. I filled my pockets
with biscuits, which I ate, as I went about doing other things.

Having found some spare planks, I made a raft, which I loaded with
bread, some hatchets, bags of nails, several cases of cordials, a car-
penter's chest, worth more to me than a cargo of gold, two good fow-
ling pieces, two pistols, some powder-horns, two barrels of powder,
some bullets, and two rusty swords; with these precious treasures]
put to sea, and safely reached the island, where I secured my raft in
a bay to a broken oar stuck in the ground, and then got my cargo
safely on land. I now made a kind of but of sea chests and planks,
and laying my guns and pistols near me, went to sleep.

Day after day I returned to the vessel, each time bringing some
thing away with me. The last and eleventh voyage I made, was
suddenly cut short; for the wind began to rise, so that I had not timo
to make a raft, but was obliged to swim to the shore for my life
The next morning the wreck was not to be seen, and thankful I .,
what I had saved from her, I set about constructing a dwelling. Har-
ing found a convenient spot where there was fresh water, security
from man and beast, and shelter from the weather,--namely, a sort of
hollow place before a cave, I proceeded in the following manner: I
first drew a half circle before the hollow place, and in it I placed two
rows of strong stakes firmly into the ground; they stood about fire
and a half feet high, and were sharpened at the top; these I so thick-
ly interwore with some pieces of cable which I had brought from the
ship, that an impenetmble wall was formed. The entrance was at the
top, by a short ladder, which I lifted in afler me. Into this enclosure
Icarried all my stores, and made a large tent to secure myself and
them from the weather. Meantime, I daily made excursions in the
island, always with my gun: I found plenty of wild goats and pigeons
which I managed to shoot.L..--

I was not entirely without companions, for though I had no human
fiend, yetI had saved from the wreck two cats and a dog, the last of
which was of the greatest use to- me, in many ways. In one of my
~rambles I caught a parrot, which I taught to speak, and which all'orded
me much pleasure.

After I had been about ten days on shore, a fear lest I should cease
to be able to tell the Sundays from the other days, caused me to in-
vent a reckoning of my own. Having set up a' wooden post, I out
upon it these words, " I c an ox anon nun, the 39th of Smnlnnn,
1659;" and every day added afresh notch; every seventh 110th
made as lfng again as the otheu. I must not forget to mention that~--'-~- ' "4"- \ . 7..

[brought three good bibleeend e few other books, from the ship, nlwo
eorne mathematical instruments, and some pens, ink, and paper.
When my dwelling was finished, I made for myself it tuble end ehuir.
One day, having need of a bag, and which had had e few grains
of corn in it, I threw the contents on the earth, outside my tent, little
thinking what would he the issue: it was just before the heavy rains,
and about a month afterwards, I saw some young green stalks shoot-
ing out of the ground; these proved to be ears of barley and rice.
When I had been about a year on the island, I was taken seriously

ill; and then it weal found the greatest comfort from my best posses-

sion.'--the Bible.

I now began regularly .to sow and gather in my harvests of barley
and rice, for I had saved my seed, and down it again, until I had a
good stock. As to my dress, I had a great high-crowned hat, made
of goat's-skin ; a jacket, the skirt of which came down to my knees;
and a pair of open-knead breeches, the hair of which hung down to
the middle of my legs; in the place ofcshoes andstockings, I had a
kind of slipper, made also of goat's skin, I wore a leathern girdle
round my waist, and a belt over my slIoulder,on II hIclI to carry my
basket. On one side of my girdle I hung a saw, and on the other a
hatchet; under my arm hung two pouches for my shot and powder.
On my shoulder was a gun; and m er my head, to keep off the sun, I
carried a great clumsy umbrella; thus was I indeed a strange figure.

One day, feeling a desire to travel across the island, I set out, and
soon reached the western coast; when I was startled by seeing a
mark in the sand, resembling the print of a man's foot; presently]
came to a place where I saw human skulls, hands, and feet, scattered
about, near the remaIns of a fire. I no longer doubted that cannibals
had been them; and' at [right and horror ran home as first as I could.

I now began to yearn for the society of a human being. the fear of
savages keeping me in continual dread. At length, one morning at
sunrise I saw the canoes full of them come on shore, and soon aller
no less than thirty__ of them were dancing round a fire. Then I saw
the cannibals drag two men out of a canoe, one of whom they imme-
diately stunned; but the other escaped from their grasp, and fled to-
wards me with surprising swiflness. 'I'erribly alarmed as I was, I
determined to stand my ground, and was all the more encouraged, as
Isaw but three of the savages pursued him ;.on coming to a creek,
one turned back, but the other two followed the poor creature through
the water. I beckoned to him to stop, and going towards his enemies,
I knocked the first down with the stock of my gun, and seeing that
the other was aiming his arrow at me, I shot him dead. The poor
savage I had saved, was much terrified by the report of my gun, but
he came to me and made the sign of submission, by placing his head
beneath my foot; then I led him to my care, and refreshed him with
bread, some raisins, and a draught of water, after which I caused him
to lie down and go to sleep.

I had now a companion, and by degrees taught hInI so conIerse
with me; he "as a wry apt scholar, and soon learned to pronounce
English words. Icalled him Friday. from the day of the week on
which I saved his life; I gave him clothes. and taught him to call me

It...0/1 _ ' , i___ x' _' ' r. 1.: ' ..

master. Soon my man l-'riday became very useful to me, and could
do anything. .

Many years did this faithful servant and myself remain on this desert
island; but at length Friday, who I had sent to the sea shore, fora
turtle, came running back to me in great terror, telling me, as well as
he could, that he had seen some canoes and some prisoners. We took
our . muskets, and having fired at the onnnibals, killed three and
wounded five ; after which the rest camped in two canoes. We hast-
ened to the canoe they had left, where we found a poor old black man,
tied hand and foot. ready to be killed. Friday fell upon the poor man,

and having hugged and kissed him, he explained to me thatI it was hie

own dear father. The old man told us that the savages had taken him
from a ship, which lay at anchor near an adjoining island, on board
which he had been, and was just leaving, when they came. We soon
agreed that Friday and his father should go in the canoe to the ship,
and implore the captain to come round to me. Anxiously I waited
until I saw the vessel bearing down ; but what was my joy on discov-
ering the captain was an Englishman? The tale is soon told--I ar
ranged with the captain'for a passage to England for myself, my man
Friday, and his father; and after a fine passage, arrived in this happy
country. I left the island on the 19th of December, 1687, having been
upon it twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days.
