 Nearly three hundred years ago, there lived in a quiet English
village a strong, brave lad named Robinson Crusoe. Like so many
other young men of that time, he was full of a longing to go to
sea, for he loved adventure and wanted to earn a living for himself.
In those days there were no steamships, and sailing vessels often
drifted out of their courses and found their way among undiscover-
ed islands in unknown seas. It was on just such a small sailing
boat that Robinson Grusoe took passage as a sailor.
They had been at sea many days, when a severe storm swept
them out of their path, far to the west, near islands that no one
knew. So bad was the storm that for days and nights the ship
tossed around on the waters; then, finally, a huge wave broke the
masts and washed all the sailors overboard, and the men tried to
swim to one of the islands. The sea was so rough and the waves

 so high that it was really impossible to
swim at all, and all the men, except Rob-
inson Crusoe, were drowned. Think of
it! He was the only one left and he was
saved because a big wave happened to
wash him up on the shore. He was so
tired and worn out that he could just
creep away from the water's edge and fall
asleep.
When he woke up, the storm was
over and the sun was shining
brightly. He climbed a tree, so as
to get a better view of the ocean,
for he was anxious to see if any
boats were near him; but alas! every-
where he could see water, but not a
ship other than the wrecked sailing
boat, lying a little way from
shore. On the island he
could see trees and bushes,
with here and there wild
animals, but not a sign of
a person. So Robinson said
   to himself; "It looks
as if I will have to
live here all by my-
self, so I might as well try to make
myself comfortable."
He collected the large pieces of
wood and the bits of rigging which
had drifted in from the wreck, and
tying these together, he made a raft. On
this he paddled out to the wreck and topk
off everything which he thought might J
prove useful—a dog and a cat, clothes,
food, sails, rope, tools, guns, ammunition,
hatchets, fishing tackle, etc. Then he
found a comfortable spot on the island,
from which he could watch the ocean, in
case a ship sailed past,—and there he
made a tent from part of the old sail. All
around the tent he put a fence of sharp
posts to keep off wild animals or men, if
any should happen along. In a few weeks, he
finished, so he had time to explore the island.

 All this while he
had been living on
the food which he
had saved from the
wreck, but he knew
that this must give
out some day, and
that he would have
to find something
to eat. His trip
around the is-
land showed
him that there
were lots of wild /i^H^i \ ' befHeS Browin& a11 of which
were good to eat; there
were also countless birds
that could be used for food,
and best of all, there were
many wild goats, which
would do not only for eat-
ing, but also would give
milk.
Robinson Crusoe then
tried fishing—he had
brought tackle from the
ship—and was de-
lighted with the big
haul he made. He felt sure then that he would never starve.
The next thing Robinson had to do was to make himself some

 clothes, for those that he had brought
from the wreck were nearly all worn
out. He shot some wild goats and
from the skins he made himself a com-
plete hunting suit. Among the herd
of goats which he came across was a
little kid, which, of course, he would
not kill. He took it home to his
tent and trained it, so that it followed
him around just like his dog.
Many years had passed and Rob-
inson Crusoe had not seen or heard
from a living person. Imagine his
surprise one day to find in the sand near
the shore the footprints of a man! At
, first he thought they must have been made
by himself, but he knew that he had not been
on that part of the island for many weeks.
Suddenly he spied a band of cannibals, who
had come from a distant island, about to kill
one of their tribe; to scare them away, he
 shot off his gun. The savages
had never heard a gun before,
and greatly frightened, they
ran to the shore, jumped into
their boats and quickly paddled
away. On the beach they left
the poor man whom they were
about to kill, and when he saw
that he had been saved, he crept
on hands and knees to where
Robinson Crusoe stood. He
was a black man and spoke a
queer language, which Robin-
son could not understand. Of
course, the stranger knew no
English, so at first it was hard
for the men to speak together.
The day on which the black
man was found was Friday, so
Crusoe took him home as his

 servant and friend, and named
him Friday.
Now, Friday proved a
very good scholar and he learnt many
things in a short time. From Crusoe he
learnt to speak a little English and he was
taught to shoot and fish, to cook and sew,
and many other things. In the day-time,
the two men hunted together, or worked
around the tent, and in the evenings,
Crusoe would read to Friday. The dog,
cat and parrot were there, and the two
men spent pleasant evenings with this
queer little family. With the tools
brought from the wreck, Robinson
Crusoe was able to make himself a
fine boat. Friday chopped down large
trees and dragged them in to where the
 men worked, and Crusoe scraped them down until they could
be put together. In this way, the boat was made. Then
from the canvas from the old ship they made a sail and on
nice breezy days they sailed all around the island, fishing and
hunting and getting food.
For fome time, this went on, and then one day Crusoe

 and his man Friday were surprised
to see a little speck out on the
ocean. They watched it with in-
terest, and surely enough, it was
growing larger and larger! All
day long they sat and stared at it,
and by noon they could plainly
make out that it was a vessel sail-
ing toward their island. In the
late afternoon, about sunset, the
ship anchored just off the island
and a ^niall boat with sailors came
on shore. It was an English vessel
that had drifted from its course,
and the next day, when it started
 on its way again for Eng-
land, Robinson Crusoe
and Friday left their is-
land and went along.
They had gathered
many precious stones and
rare skins during their
long stay, and these they
took back with them.
They were welcomed
heartily at Crusoe's home,
and he lived to make
many, many more voyages.
