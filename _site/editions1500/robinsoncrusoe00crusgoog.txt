PREFACE. 



SOME writers have affirmed that mankind are all born 
with the fame difpofitions and the fame degree of under- 
flanding ; and that education^ laws, and cuiloms, create all 
the diiferencc perceivable between man and man. I confefs, 
I can hardly bring myfelf to fdppofe that education alone 
produced the wide dtilimilarity which exiftj between thte 
characters of Therfitcs and Achilles, or thofe of Socrates and 
Anytus : at the fame time it will ever be an acknoH'ledged 
truth, that even he who is moft indebted to Nature will reap 
but fmall advantage from her gifts, unlefs they arc improved 
hy mature and Judicious cultivation. 

It is anneceflary to undertake a ferioas dtsmonihation of a 
truth univerfally admitted in all a^es and nations ; a truth 

. confirmed by daily experience^ and the pradtice of which 
was the object conflantly aimed at by the labours both ^ 
of the philofbpher and the bulk of mankind. The ini- 
provement of the latter, Jas far as it can be elFefted by 
education, has been more attended to in the prefcnt age 
than ever it was in any preceding one. If the endeavours 

• ufed to this purpofe have not had all the fuccefs that might 
be expelled from them, they have at lead excited the atten- 
tion and directed the minds of men towards an obje^, the 
accomplifhment of which, as k is more or lefs perfect, has 
ever a proportionable efFedl upon the happinefs of families, 
and confequently upon the (late of fociety m general. 

A great genius of the prefent age has contributed, even by 
his faife opinions, towards the accomplifhment of this impor- 
tant objed : for the errors of great men are remarked, and 
the difcuflion of them frequently leads to the troth from 
^ich the^ have deviated. Thus Mr. RouiTeau's Emilias 
vnll, in fpite of the falfe opinions advanced in it, always be a 

- valuable book, both on account of the important truths which 
it contains, and thofe which it has caufed to be difcovered ; 
and it would be unjuft not to attribute to it at leafl a confi- 
derable enlargement in our ideas concerning ^ucasi^tL* . 

A3 "^^ 



av p R £ F A e t. 

To fret our fpecies, as far as in us lies, from the dlnenb 
and difabilities to which Nature fubjefts them from their 
very birth, is a great objedt, but certainly not the only one. 
It is eilential to tociety ^at its members be ibund and robuil 
in conftitution ; but if they are not, at the fame time, honeft> 
jufl, and good, they will be of more prejudice than advantage 
to fodety. Mr, RouiTeau was perfedly fenfible of this truth ; 
he has paid confiderable attention to it ; but, if I may be al- 
lowed the aiTertion, he was frequently deceived both ia the 
Jiature of fodal virtue, and the extent to which it ihould be 
pradifed. While he boldly attacks the prejudices under which 
jve are enflaved from our in£mcy, he has, on the other hand^ 
idenied, or endeavoured to render doubtful, many valuable 
truths which constitute our happinefs in a more advanced age. 
While he meant to prune away the greedy branches tSat 
impeded the growth of die tree, he has, though perhaps 
fvithout intention, wounded its very roots. Whilft he Wifhes 
/to aflift Nature, he allows Nature too much ; and where he 
.thought he found her drfedive, he has not always been abie 
to find the beA means of fupplying her defedb. ^a a wprd, 
young Emilius is the child of Mr. Roufleau's fancy, not the 
child of education. 

Nevertheleis, the fQllowing work is indebted to that of 
JMr. RottfTeau fyr the form that it bears. Mr. Campe, the 
author of it, cxpreffes himfelf thus : '* I never read the^ 
following pakkge in the fecond volume of Emilius without 
the moft lenfible fatisfadion. Nothin? upon earth can b« 
lb well calculated to infpire one with ardour in the execution 
of a plan approved by fo great a genius." 

" Might there not be found means," fays Roufleau,, 
^' to bring together (o many lefTons of inibudion that lie 
fcattered in fo many books ; to apply them through a iingle 
object of a familiar and npt uncommon nature, capable of 
engaging the imitation, as well as roufing and fixing the 
attention even at fo tender an age ? If one could imagine a 
situation in which all the natur^ wants of man appear in the 
deareft light to the underiUnding of a child, and in whidv 
the means of iatisfying theie wants unfold themfelves fuccef- 
fively in the fame clear, eafy manner, the lively and natural 
defcription of fuch a fete fhould be the firft means that I 
would ufe to fet his imagination at work. 

*^ I fee thine expand already, thou ^rc^nt philoibpher.

PREFACE. V 

4$f;ri)aiedt and> no diTpara^ement to yoar talents, mucli better 
tiutja you would defcnbe it yourfelf, at le^ft with more truth 
and fimplicity. Since we muil have books, there is one that 
fiirnifhes, in my opinion, the beft imagined treadfe upon 
natural edui^don that can podibly be. This book (hall be 
the firft that I will put into the hands of my Emilius ; this 
finely i}2iall for a long time compoTe lus whcde library^ and 
in&id^ (hall always hold a diiling|ai(hed pla^ there. It 
ihall be ih/s tex^ to which all our difcourfes upon natural 
Science (hall ferve as a commentary. It ihall be the criterion 
.of our taHe and judgment ; and> as long as thefe remain 
uncorruptedy the reading of it will always be agreeably to us. 
Well, men, what is tms wonderful book ? Is it AriftotU^ 
Fliny> Bv^n ?— No : it is Robinfon Crufoe. 

** Robinfon Crufoe, alone i^ his ifland, deprived of tlie 
affiftance of his fetk>w-creatures, without * tools of any ixnfp 
yet providing for his fafety and fubfiftence, and even pro- 
coring hinxTelf a £on of happiaefs, pfefents^a fubjeft intcreft- 
ing to every age, and which there might be a thousand yfnys 
of making agreeable to children. This you (c^ realizes the 
ideal circumflances of the defert ifland, which 1 nfed at firft 
as a comparifon. I grant, it is by no means the ftate of man 
as deflined for fociety ; nay, probably Enulius might never 
experience fuch a iituatioa ; neverthelefs, it is that by which 
he fhould eitimate the value of every other condition in life. 
The fureil way to rife fuperior to all prejudice, and to form 
our judgment upon the true report of things, is to plac* 
ourielve^ in the Situation of a man cut off from all fociety, 
and to jud|;e of every thing as that man muft naturally judge, 
regard being had at the fame time to his own degree of 
utility in the fphere of exiflence. 

'* This fiory, cleared of all its unneceiTary rubbifh, begin- 
ning with Robinfon's being (hipwrecked upon his ifland^ 
and ending with the arrival of the veHel that takes him away, 
ihal) he both the amufement and inilruflion of Emilius

particular neceiTary to he known in fuch a cafe ; he fliall 
imagine bim/el^ to he Rohinfon Crufoe, and drefs himfelf 
up in (kins, with a great cap on his head, a hroad fword by 
his fide, and, in fhort, the whole of the grotefque drefs and 
accoutrements with which we generally fee Rohinfon Cru- 
foe's pi6hire reprefented, except the umbrella, for he (hall 
have no occafion for that* I will have him ftudy how he 
Ihould proceed if he happened to be in want of this or that 
neceflary ; he fhall examine his hero's conduft, and try if he 
has left nothing undone, or if he went the heft way to work 
about what he has done ; he (hall remark where he is wrong, 
and take care not to fall into the fame miflake himfelf; for you 
need not have the leail doubt but he will be for imitating 
Rohinfon in his whole plan. Nothing, indeed, can be better 

• calculated to pleafe the imagination at that calm period of 
life, when, if our wants are latisfied, and our adlions unre- 
ftrained, we look no farther for happinefs. 

" What advantage may not an able mailer take of thb 
romantic-projed in a child ! a projedl to which he himfelf 

: has gi vent birth for the fake of the profitable fruits that may 
be reaped from it. The child, ever hu fy and eager to make 
provifion for his idand fettlement, will be more ready to learn 
than the mafter to teach. He will defire to know every thing 

. that is ufefiil, and nothing more ; you will have no occadon to 

• fpur him on. The exercife of the natural arts, for which one 
i man alone is fufiident, leads to ihe invention of the arts of 

induffay, which require the co>operation of many hands." 

This pafTage from* Rouifeau will explain, infinitely better 
than I can, the utility of a book compofed upon fuch a plan ; 

■ it now remains to be feen how far Mr. Campe, the author 
of the following work, has purfued Mr. RoufTeau's idea. 
. The public is pretty generally agreed not to depend on 
the report of tranflators concerning the works which they 
tranflate, efpecially if their judgment he favourable to the 
original : and I believe this caution is well founded ; for it 
is no eafy matter to decide with impartiality where fclf- 
opinion has eqod influence with juftice in pafling the 
fentence; 

Perhaps fome may not think as I do concerning this 
work of Mr. Campe's ; particularly, thofe who are fond of 

, meUphydcal treatiies upon education, will, no doubt, be 
.di&ppointed to find nothing in the New Robinibn Crufoe 
^t things that are afeful> introduced in an unaffcfted man-

ner, clearly expteffcd and demonftrated without pedantry ; 
they will fee furprifed to fee diildren fpeak like children, 
and their inftrudtor affume the iimple language of childhood, 
in order to make himfelf underflood. Thofe who are go- 
"verned by the fpirit of free thinking will find it flrange 
that religion is refpedted and rendered refpeftable in this 
work ; 3iat God is reprefented as the mover of all things, 
and the principle to whidi all our aftions (hould be referred, 
'as well as the motives which determine them, and the fen* 
timents which gave them birth. Thefe are, no doubt, par- 
ticularities that may be remarked : neverthelefs, at this 
time of day, to think wifely we mull not always think 
with philofophers. . • 

'* The Old Robinfon Crufoe," fays Mr. Campe, in hit 
Preface to the original of this work, '• independent of its 
other defefta, is erroneous in one particular fufficient to de- 
ftroy every advantage that this Hiftory might produce, which 
is, that Robinfon Crufoe is provided with all forts of Eu- 
ropean tools and inftruments neceffary to procure him many 
of thofe convenieftcies that belong to fooety. Thus the 
opportunity is loft of affording the young reader a lively 
fenfe both of the wants of man in a ftate of folitude, and 
the multiplied happin^s of a focial life ; another important 
reafon why 1 thought proper to depart from the old Hittory 
of Robinfon Cruloc* 

♦* I have, therefore, divided the time of my New Ro- 
binfon Crufoe's remaining upon the ifland into three pe- 
riods. In the firft he is all alone and deftitute of any Eu- 
ropean tool or inib-ument whatfoever, alfifting himfelf 
merely by his hands and invention ; in order to fhew, on 
the one hand, how helplefs man is in a fbte of folitude,. 
and^ on the other, how much refledlion and perfevering ef- 
forts can contribute to the improvement of our condition^ 
In the fecond period, I give iiim a companion, on purpofe 
to Ihew how much a man's fituation may be bettered by 
taking even this fingle ftep towards fociety. Laftly, in the 
third period, a velfel from Europe is ihipwrecked on his. 
yiand, and gives him an opportunity thereby of providing' 
himfelf with tools and moft other articles neceffary in com- 
mon life, in order that the young reader may fee how va- 
luable many things are of which we are accuflomed to make 
very littk account, "becaufe we have never experienced the 
want of them*'*

Thus far the Frenck Tran£Latof''$ ?xc&Jte : wUch coiu- 
ttining a very ample explanation of ^e i>lan and fcope ojf 
the iMowing work, there is little neceffity to offier an/ 
thing in addition to what he has faid upon that fubjed. It 
. only remains for the Englifh Tranfiator to requeft the in- 
duleence of the Pablic> on account of the deviations which 
he has taken the liberty to make from the original. M.an/ 
paffsLges he has found himfelf obliged either to os^t en*- 
tirely, or to throw into a new form, according as the differ- 
ence of national manners and character feemed abfolutely to 
require it. He hopes, however, that this liberty has never 
been uled unlefs under circumftances of unavoidiable necef- 
fity. For the external form of this little work, it is but 
jnft to obferve, that no pains have been ipared to embelli^ 
it, and that the addition of 32 handibme cuts cannot fail of 
rendering it at <Nice more fprightly and inteUigible co the 
young reader, for whom it is intended. In effe^, thefc Httle 
prints ferve admirably to afford the child a juft conception 
of the remarkable paflages in a work ; and it may, per- 
haps, be affirnwd, with truth, that no parts, even- of the 
.moft intcrefting flories, make a ftronger or more lading im- 
prefiiofi on the memory, than thofe whicl^ are the fubjedts^ 
of the cuts. 

With thefe advantages, it is hoped, the .New Robinfbn 
Crufoe will fin4 -its way to the itudies of the younger <:lars 
of both fcxes, and afford them at once both innocent enter- 
tainment and moral inibudion.

NEW ROBINSON CRUSOfi; 



FmST EVENING. 



A GENTLEMAN, of the name of Billingflejr, refidinS 
foQie years ago at Twickenham, who, having a pretty^ 
large family, and bat a moderate fortune, determined &X 
.undertake hiilifelf the care of his children's education^ He* 
propofed;, by this plan^ on the one handy to avoid the enof- 
jfpous expeuce of keeping them at what are called genteeL 
.boarcKng-fchools, and, on the other, to enjoy the pleafinj 
^bfervation of their improveo^ent in leafning^fenfe, and goo 
behaviour. To remark, with iilent but attentive eyes>. ther 
gradual advance of his children to^yards the perfedion o£ 
reafon and virtue j to aflift, with his advice and inftruf^ion^ 
their endeavours <30 become more learned, honeil, and. wife ?. 
and to have the happy confcioufnefs, that he Ihould onc<l»y 
be confidered, what all parents ought, as the inftrument. 
and caufe of his children's eternal welfare ; all this,, he- 
thought, would be more than a fufficicnt reward foE what- 
ever cares and fatigue he fhould undergo in- the couiib of 
tbeir education. 

. He^ therefore ,. laid down for them a regular plan of ffu— 
dy, to which he afterwards ftridtty adhered. Jnthiswaii 
included a coorfe of reading ^ and fome book,^ that was at: 
once both inllra£tive and entertainjing, afforded them amufe— 
mcnt every cv^fning for two or three hours before fupper; 
hiat, as this «xerci& was ineaiot by t^tk^&dwc-foielyto eft-

creaic their fund of knowledge ^ and enlarge their luider- 
flanding, in order that it might appear rather as a relaxation, 
from their clofer iludies, than a labour inipofed on thein» 
Mr. Billingfley, in general^, undertook the taik of reading 
himfelf. The following Hiftoiy of the New Robinfoa 
CruToe was, daring fcrnie weeks, the fubjedt of their even- 
ing's entertainment ; and was thus introduced. 

Mr. and Mrs. Billingfley, being feated by the parlour 
fire, together with Mr. Rofe and Mr. Meredith, two inti- 
mate friends of the family, and all the children, whofe names 
will appear fucceflively in the cpurfe of the ftory, being af- 
fembied in their proper places, Mr. Billingfley began hb 
relation as follows : 

Mr, BiUingJlej. Well, my dear children, I have a book 
for your entertainment this evening that contains a very 
extraordinary ftory. Some parts of it will make your hair 
ftand on end, and others will perfedtly delight you. 

George Ah ! but do not let it be too melancholy, papa, 
Harritt. No, my dear papa, not too melancholy ; for 
^en it will make us all cry, you know. 

Rkhani, Hold your tongues ; papa knows what to read> 
1 warrant you. 

Mr, Bill. Do not be uneafy, my dears. I will take care 
that there. (hail not be any thing too tragical in it. 

There lived in the town of Exeter a perfon of the name 
of Crufoe, who followed the profeflion of a broker. He had 
three ions, the eldeft of whom, having an inclination to 
fcrve in the army, enlifted himfelf as a foldier, went abroad 
with his regiment to Flanders, and was killed at the battle 
of Fontenoy, 

The fecond entered the Univeriity of Oxford, and made 
a considerable progrefs in learning ; but purfuing his ftu- 
dies with too much eagernefs, he impaired his health beyond 
ail pofiibiiity of recovering, and died of a confumption. 

1 here remained, therefore, but the youngeft, wbofc name 
was Robinlbn. In him, as he was now become their only 
fon, Mr. and Mrs. Crufoe placed all their hopes and ex- 
pe^tions. They loved him as the apple of their eye^ but 
their love was blind and injudicious. 

Geo. What is the meaning of that, papa ? 
Mr, Bill. \ will tell you— Your mother and I love youx 
all, my dear children, as you well know ; but for that very 
jrcaiba we keep yoa cloie at your btiiinefs every day,, and 

teach 



ROBINSON CltUSOE. It 

teach you many things both afefnl and agreeable^ becaafe 
we know that to be the beft way to make you good and 
happy. But Robinfon's parents did not a£t in the fame man^ 
ncf- lliey fufFered their drar child to do whatever he 
pleafed ; and as this dear child IHced better to play than to 
work or to kam any thing> they let him play almoft the 
whole day long^ by whieh means he learned little or nothing. 
Now this is wluit we call an injudicious love in parents. 
Gft9. I underftand now^ papa. 

Mr* Bilh Robinfon grew up a ftout ftripling before 
his parent had determined what proibffion they fhould give 
him. His father was defirous that he Ihpuld learn tome 
trade, but the fon had not the leaft inclination that way. 
He faid he ihould like better to travel, to fee the world, and 
become acquainted with the various objeds and cuiloms that 
foreign countries afibrd. 

In fpeaking thus, young Crufoe Ihewed his ignorance 
and fixly. If he had begun by laying in a good flock of 
learning, it would have been another matter. But what 
profit could a raw^ ignorant boy, like him, gain by feeing 
foreign countries ? When a man wiihes to make his way in 
the world> be it in what country it will, he ought to be pro- 
vided beforehand with a tolerable fhare of knowledge ; but 
this was what Robinfon never once thought of. 

He was now feventeen years of age. The greateft part 
of this timp he had mifpent in fauntering about and playing 
in the fireets of Exeter. Every day he was teazmg his 
fathcr-for leave to go and travel. But his father told him 
that he did not know his own mind, nor what fort of a re- 
queil he was making, and therefore would not hear a word 
upon the fubjedt. ** My dear child," his mother would 
fay to him, '* flick to your own country, and never thuik 
of rambling." 
One day— — — — 
Harriet. Aha ! now it begins. 
£dw, Pfhaw ! hold your tongue. 
Mr. Billp One day, when^ according to cuftom, he was 
ftroUing about the ftneets, he met one of his old playfellows, 
whofe father was captain of a fhip trading to Amilerdam, 
and who had juft come down from Plymouth to fee fome of 
his relations that lived at Exeter. He told Robinfon that 
he was to fet off with his fetker in a day or two for Am- 
« ferdamt

Crufoe ? 

Mr. Rofe. I have not yet found any ; but one thing I 
know for certain, which is, that no good cai^ever con\e of 
young people who behaye like him. 

Rich. Well, let us hear what becomes of Robinfon^ 
Mr. Bill. A fhort time after Rohini[bn> and the captain's 
ion were got on board,, the failors weighed anchor and ict 
their fails, llie wind blew freih, and they cleared out of 
the harbour, bidding adieu to Plymouth for a fhort white. 
Young Crufoe was upon the deck with hi^ friend, and al- 
moft out of his wits with joy that he was at hngth going to 
becin his travels.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. XJ 

The evening was fine, and the breeze blew Co fevourably, 
that they foon loft fight of the town and harbour of Ply- 
mouth. They were now on the open Tea, and Rbbinfbh 
ilared with admiration when he faw nothing before him but 
the fky ' and the water. By degrees they began to lofe 
fight of land, and as night came on they could fee nothing 
on that quarter but the Eddiftone lighthoufe. This alfo

Geo, That muft be a profpe<5l ! 

Mr. Mered. It is not impoffible but you may fee fuch a

Geo, Oh ! fhall we go upon the fea ? 

Mr. Mered, If you will be very attentive while you are 
learning geography, fo as to know which conrfe you muft 
take to go from one place to another. 

Mr, BilL Yes, and if by working conftantly, and being 
temperate in your viftuals, you make your bodies hardy 
enough to bear the fatigue of fuch a voyage, we may, perAaps» 
fome day in fummer, take a boat down the river as fiur as 
London, where fome of you have never been vet. ^ 

M the Children. Ohi oh! 

Mr, BVl, 1 cannot tell but we may take a trip to Mar- 
gate for a fe\^ weeks, where you will have as wide a prof- 
pefl of the fea as Robinfon Crufoe had when he was failing 
out of Plymouth harbour. (Here they all get up and run 
about their father. They hang on his neck, his arms^ and his 
knees, expnging their joy with carejfes, elappi^ of bands ^ ani 
jumping ahout7) 

Harriet, Will you let me make one of the party } 

Mrs, Bill, Yes, my dear, if you are able to go fo far. 

Harriet, But it is very far, is it not, papa ? Perhaps far^* 
thcr than Richmond, where Mr. Compton' lives> and ano* 
•thcr gentleman that has a great houfe and a large garden—* 
Oh ! fo large ! a great deal larger than our g^den. I was 
all through it, was I not, papa ? the day diat Chaxiotte and 
I were gathering cowflips m the meadow. 

Mr. Bill. Yes, I remember, and we were looking at 
the- folks plowing. 

Harriet, Yes, and we went into g finith^'s forge that was 
by the road's fide. . '

Harriets Ah* yes, where the wind blew off my jboonee. 
Mr, Bill. \YhIch the miller's boy brought back to you 
again. 

Harriet, That was a good boy ; was he not, papa ? 
Mr, Bill, Yes, he was a good boy for being fo obliging b& 
to do us a kindnefs, though he had never feen us before. 
Harriet, However, you gave him fomething, I fuppofe. 
Mr, JSiJi, Certainly, my dear, I gave him fomethjuig ; 
for every one likes to reward thofe that are obliging; — But 
we forget Robinfon Crufoe. We muft make halle to over- 
take him, or elfe we (hall lofe fight of him, for he is going 
M a furious rate. 

For two days they had conftantly good weather and a fa- 
vourable wind. The third day the iky was darkened with 
clouds, the wind blew with uncommon violence^ and the air 
grew every moment darker and darker. 

In fhort, it was a dreadful ilorm. At one time the light- 
joiag flatbed a^i if the fky was on fire; then fucceed^d a pitchy 
Jarknefs, like that of nudnight^ wiUi claps of thunder which 
they thought would never ei\d. The rain came down in 
floods, and the violence of the wind toffed the fea about in 
fuch a manner that the waves fwelled and rofe mountaiii 
high. 

Then it would have been worth while to fee how the fliip 
went fee-faw. One time a large wave carried it, as it were, 
up to the clouds ; another time k dipped dSwn as if it wa3 
going to the bottom of the deep ; then it rolled to one fidje 
an4 the other, and lay down io flat that at times its very 
m^Rfi feemed to touch the water. 

What a noife was amongfl the ropes I what a clatterip£ 
upon the deck I The failors were obliged, each of thea^, tS 
hold fail to fomething or other for fear of being wafhed over- 
board. Robyifpa Crufoe, who had never been accuflomed 
to all this, grew giddy, felt a ficknefs at his ilomach» aii4

aiked Robinfon^ who ms &lf-dead with affrighit* 

*' Ah ! we are all loft !" anfwered one ^^*'bl|jfe?"r" ; 
« the lightning has ihivered our mizen-maft tQe'i^eces^'* 
(that is>. the hindmoft of the three mafts that are in a ih]p«| 
* ' and the main-mafl ftands by fo (lender a hold that we mw 
cut it down and throw it overboard." 

« We are all loft '." cried out another voice from below | 
" the (hip has fprung a leak> and there are four feet watf^ 
in the hold.'' 

At thefe words Robinibn, who was fitting down on the 
cabin flobr> fell backwards^ void of (enfe and laotion. All 
the reft ran to the pump, in order j^ if poifible, to keep the 
veflel afloat. At laft, one of the failors came and Ihook 
Kobinfbn by the ihoulder* alking him if he intended to be 
the only one who would do nothu^ for the prefervation iQf 
the ftiip, but lie there ftretched at his length while all the 
reft of the people worked until they were not able to ftand. 

He tried, therefore, to rife, weak as he was, aq4 took his 
place atone of the pumps. In the mean time the captain 
ordered fome guns to be ftred a$i a flgnal of diftrefs to other 
fiiips» if there fliouki happen to be any within hearing capa- 
ble of aflifting them. Robinfon, who did not know the 
meaning of thefe ftiots, thought the vefTel was fplitting in 
pieces, and fainted away again. One of the failors,^ wh(> 
took his place at the pump> pufhed him on one £ide with hi9 
ibot, and left him there ftretched at fiiU length,, imagioing 
thathe was dead. 

They pumpcfd with aU their fbength ; nevertbelefs tl^ 
water ftill gained upon them in the holdj^ and now they onljf 
waited tix ue moment when the veftel would fink. In CM-der 
to lifhten her, they threw overboard every thine that they 
ficmlapofliblY fjpare, as the guns, bales of goods^ hogfhead«„ 
ire* But all that was of no manner of feryice . 

However, another ftup had heard their fign^ of diftre^» 
and, as the Oorm began about this time to abate confide- 
rably, ventured to fend out her boat, in order, if poffible, 
fofa^e the crew. But the boat could not come near, the 
waves running too high. At length, however, they can^e 
mear enough to throw a rope to the people who were on 
board, by means of which they towed the boat clofe under 
the (hip's fternj^ ^d then every pne who cpuld make uie pf

fland upon his, was tumbled in haftiFjr by fome of liie Tea:- 
men more compaffionate than the reft. 

Thejr^J^ hardly rowed many minutes, before the (hip, 
which iwfe ftill pretty near them, funk before their eyes. 
Happily the fbrm was now almoft totally abated, otherwile 
the waves would inevitably have fwallowed up the boat, 
which was then as full of people as it could hold. After ma- 
ny dangers it got (afc at kngth to the fhip, where they were 
«ll taken in. 

Gfo. Ah ! well, I am glad,, however, that the poor people 
were not drowned. 

£dw. I was fadly in pain for them. 

Harriet. Well, this will teach matter Robinfon never to 
be fo naughty again. 

Mrs, Bill, That is juft my opinion too. Let us hope that 
he will be the better for this danger. 

Henry, Well, what became of him after ? 

Mr, B'U, The (hip that had taken him andthereff-of the 
crew in, was bound to London. In four davs (he arrived at 
•the Nore» and the next day came- to anchor in the river. 

Charlotte. What is the Nore, papa ? 
' Mr, Btll, The Nore is a fmall fandy bank at the mouth 
of the Thames, w^ere ;^ veifel is conf^ntly ftationed, which 
hangs up two lights every night to be a guide tor fhips that 
enter the river. 

They now landed, and happy was each one to iiave thus 
cfcaptd the dangers of the fea. As to Robinfon, his firft 
care was to iee London, and for this purpofe he fpent a day 
or two in rambling all over the city, where he met with fuch 
a variety of new obje^s as entirely put the remembrance of 
paft dangers out of his head, as well as all thoughts of the 
future. Happening one day to meet the captain with whom 
■ he had fet fail from Plymouth, he received an invitation to 
dine wkk him, which was very agreeable to Robinfon,. acs 
he had fpfent what Kttle money he had borrowed from the 
captain's fon, and his pocket now was not able to afford 
him a fingle meal. At dinner the captain aflced him what 
particular motive he had for going to Amfterdato, and what 
he intended to have done there. Robinfon anfwered him 
frankly, that he had nothing in view but his amufement ; 
that he had come oiF unknown tahis father and mother,, and 
at jM^fent did not knoiv what to do with himfelf. 

<' Unknown to your father juid mother.!'' cried thecsp- 

tain.

tain, laying down his knife and fork : <'<j<k>d heavens I 
why did not I know that before ? Believe me; imprudent 
yoting man, if I had known ib much at Plymouth^ 1 would 
not have taken yon on board of my fhip^ if you had ofiered 
sie a million of money/' 

Robinfon fat mth down-caft eyes blufhing for ihame, an<l 
«naUe to ;mfwer a iingle word. . 

The honeft captain continued to reprefent to him the 
felly that he had been guilty of, and told him that he could 
never be happy «nlefs he repented of what he had done, and 
obtained forgivendTs of his parents. At thefe words Robin* 
tan, wept bitterly. 

^* But what can I do now V* cried he at length, fobbing 
heavily. ** What can you do ?'* faid the captain : ** Re- 
turn to your parents, fall on your knees before them, and» 
like a feniible and dutiful lad, implore their pardon for your 
imprudence : that is what ycAi can do, and what you ought 
to do." 

Harriet. Ah, papa, I lik^ this captain much ; he was a 
very good man. 

J Mr. Bill. M^ dear, he did what every one ought to do 
when he fees his fellow-creature fall into an error ; he en- 
deavoured to bring this young man back to his duty. 

** Will you take me with you to Plymouth again ?" faid 
Robinfon. 

" Who, I ?" faid the captain : '* Have you forgot, then, 
that my fhip is loO; ? It may be a coniiderable time before 
I return there in a (hip of my own : but as for you, there ir 
not a moment to lofe ; you mould go-aboard of the very forft 
veiTel that f;uls for Plymoudi, if it were even to-day." 

<* But," fays Robinfon, ** I have no money." 

•' Well," (aid the honeil captain, «* 1 will lend you a 
couple of guineas out of the little that I have to fpare. Ga^ 
down to the river, and get aboard of fome vefTel that is bound 
for Plymouth, unlefs you rather chufe to travel by land. If 
your repentance is fincere, God will blefs your return, and 
make it happier than your outfet has been." With thefe 
words, having made an end of dinner, he (hook Robinfon by 
(he hand, and wiihed him a good voyage, who parted from 
him with many thanks for his kindnefs and good advice. , 

Edw. What, is he going back home again already ? I 
thought the fiory was only be^pinning.

The evening was fine, and the breeze blew fo ^vourably, 
that they foon loft fight of the town and harbour of Ply- 
mouth. They were now on the open Tea, and Robinfbh 
ftared with admiration when he faw nothing before him but 
the fky ' and the water. By degrees they began to lofe 
fight of land, and as night came on they could fee nothing 
on that quarter but the Eddiftone lighthoufe. This alfo 
difappeared in a fhort time, and from that moment Robinfon 
faw nothing above him but the iky, nor before, behind, and 
all round him, but the fea. 

Geo. That muft be a profpeft !

Mr, Bill, Yes, and if by working conftantly, and being 
temperate in your viduals, you make your bodies hardy

feme day in fummer, take a boat down the river as far as

fire was feen no more. It is to be obfcrved, that the flames 
had, at length, reached the powder-room, and this was the. 
caufe of the fhip's blowing up. 

Nobody cbtdd tell as yet what was become of the poor 
people belonging to her. There was a poffibility that they 
might have taken to their boats before the veffel blew up ; 
'for whkh reUon the captain coftdhaed firing jgtms thb whofe 
night, in order to inform them on what quarter the 4hip 
was that de^ed to alTifl them. He alfo ordered al! the lan^ 
.ferns to be hung out, that they might have a dutnce of 
ieeing the fliip in the oight-time. 

At break of dav they difcovered, by sieans of thdr glafles; 
•two boats full of people, tofimg about It the mercy of die 
^SLves, They could perceive that the wind was againft 
them, but that they rowed with all their force towaros the 
ihip. Immediately the captain ordered the colours to be 
hoiHed^Ls a iignal that he faw theit diilrefs, and was restdy to 
. lelievc them. At the fame time the (hip made all die fsdl 
poilible towards them, and in the fpace of half an hoorhap* 
.pily camic up with them. 

There were fixty in the boats, men, women, and chil- 
dren, who were all taken on board. It was an zSe6^^ 
:&xne to behold die adions of thefe poor people when th^ 
iaw themfelves Co happily delivered. Some fobbed ana 
-wq>t for jOy^ others lamented as if their danger was bat 
juil begun ; fome jumped about upon the deck as if thejr 
had loft their wits, others were wringing their hands, and as 
pale ajs death; foveral of them were laughing like mad 
people, and danced and ihouted for joy ; others, tin die con* 
trary, ftood ftock-ftill as if fpeechlefs and infendble^ aoA 
tx)nld hot utter a iingle word. 

J Sometimes one or two amongft them fell on their kneef, 
lifted up their hands to Heaven, and with a loud voice re- 
sumed thahk^ to God, whdfe providence had fo miraco- 
loufly faved them irom perUhing. 

. Some 'of them again would (brt up, dance about lik^ 
children, tear their cloaths, cry and ndl down in fanitni^ 
iits, from which they could with difficulty be recovered. 
There was none of the {hip's crew, though ever fo hard- 
ened, that could help fhedding tears at the fight of iJiefe

icon as he fet his fopt upon the deck, he fell upon his face,' 
a^id feemed to have lod all fenfe and motion. The captain 
went to affiil him, thinking that he had fwooned away ; but 
the clergyman cdmly thanked him for his good-nature, and 
faid> " Allow me firft to return thanks to my Creator for 
our deliverance ; I will afterwards endeavour to (hew you 
how lively a fenfe I entertain of your extreme kindnefs to 
us." Upontjiis the captain politely withdrew. 

The prieil remained a few minutes in this poftnie of hum- 
ble proilration ; after which, rifing chearfully, he went to 
the captain to telllfy his gratitude to him for the civility that 
JKe had {hewn to liim and his people. This done, he turned 
to his companions in misfortune, and faid, ** My dear 
friends, calm the agitation of your minds. 1 he Being

Other's hand over yoa. You ihould lift vp your hearts to

diTmal night between hope and fear» exerting all thAr 
flrength to get to the fhip, but continaally driven back bf 
Ac "Winds and waves. At lengthy however, the long-wifhed^ 
for appearance of day put an end to their diftrefs. 

Robinibn all this time had been filled with the moil 
dreadful reflexions, *' Heavens !" faid he to himfelf, 
•• if thefe people, ainongft whom there are certainly many 
good and devout perfons, have fuffcred fo great diftrefsj 
what muil not I expeOi, who have aded with fo much in- 
gratitude towards my poor parents l'* This thought lay 
neavy at hb heart. Pale and filent, like one whofe confciencfe 
is not good, he fat in a corner^ with his hands clafped to- 
gether, and fcarcely daring even to pray, becaufe he feared 
i?ft God would have no regard to his prayers. 

The people who were faved from the boats, and were al- 
jnoft exhavfbed wit^ fktigue, had now taken /ome refrefh- 
neat^ when their captain, holding a large purfe full of mo- 
ney in his hand, came op to the fhip's captain, and told 
him that whatever money they had been able to fave froita 
their fhip was in that purfe, which he begged him to accept 
as a flight mark of the gratitude which they all entertained 
towards him for the prelervation of their lives. 

<< God forbid;^" anfwered the captain, <« that I fliould 
accept ycmrofiers ! 1 have done no more than hamanity 
.«eqiiired of me, and 1 am convinced that you would hav^ 
daiie theiame dung if yoohad been in oar j^ace, and vre 
ia fours. 

. ' LoL vain did the Frenchuuin prefs him to accept the purfe^ 
'ihci captain: perfifled in refaflng it, and begged him to ttf 
ao BAore about it.— It was now debated where they fliould 
laiid the people that had been faved. To carry them tt^ 
Gnnea aid not appear advifeable for two reafons. In tha 
€rfi place, why fliould thofe poor peq>le'be obUged to mak« 
lb long a voyage to a country where tKey had not the leaft 
bnfinefs in the world ? And, befldes, there were not provifions 
enough aboard . for fo many people to hokl out until they 
Ihould arrive at Guinea. ^ 

At length th^ captain generoufly refelved to go a hun- 
dred Icaguea out ot his way for the fake of thefe poor peo- 
ple, and to carry them to Newfoundland, where they might 
have an opportumty of returning to Funce in fome of the 
Slips employed in uie cod fifliery.

Rkh, Do not yon remember what papa has tofd us about 
the coid fifti ; how they come dbwn from the North Teas ta 
the very banks of Newfoundland, where people filh for thead 
and catch them in fuch quantities ? 

Harriet, Oh, yes I now I recolleft. 

Rich, Xook here on the map: this is Newfoundland up 
here, near to America, and thofe dotted fpots are the bonk* 
where they fifh for the. cod. ' 

Mr. B IL To Newfoundland, therefore, they bent their 
courfe ; and as it happened to be the middle of the.fifhinfi;'' 
ieafon, they found feveral French veffels there, which toOK 
o?i board the people of the fhip that had blown up. Their 
gratitude to the Englilh captain was too great to be cx- 
prefled in words. 

As he had now, therefore, conduced them to ihips of their 
own nation," he returned with a favourable wind in order to 
continue his own voyage to the Coaft of Guinea. The 
ihip cut the waves* with the fwiftnefs of a bird that wings it» 
Viify way thrpugii the fkies, and in a fhort time they ha<l 
ifdled feme hundred leagues. This was what Robinfon 
Grufoe liked ; things never cooH go too faft for him, as kc 
was of a rcftlefs, unfettled difpofition. 

Their couirfc now was moftly direftcd to the Southward* 
One day as they were fleering in that diredion, they per- 
ceived a large (hip making up towards them. Prefendy 
after they heard them ^t fome guns of diftrcfs, and could 
iifcern that they had loll their foremaft and bowfprit. 

• Eino. Bowfprit ? What is that? 

\ Mr, Bill. Why, furely, you cannot have forgot what 
tkat is. 

• E^w, Ah * right ! It is a little maft that does not ftand 
ftraight up like the reft, but comes out floping^ fo, from thd 
fore-part of the Ihip. 

Mr. Bill, Very well. They fteered their courfe towards^ 
the fhip that was in diftrefs, and when they were within 
hearing of each other, the people aboard of her cried out> 
«* For Heaven's fake have compaffion on us, and fave our 
lives ! We are at the laft extremity, and muJft perifh if you 
do not relieve us.'* 

The captain, therefore, afked them in what coniifted their 
diftrefs ; wheiv one of their number anfwered thus : 

*' We are Englifhmen, bound for the French Ifland of 
MartmifiOi^'— ^e> children ; here it lies in the We& iTudk^^

Mr. Bill. It is a kind of whirlwind occasioned by many

•• The hurricane," continued he, ** blew furiouffy three, 
days and three nights. We loft our onads, and were driven 
feme hundreds of leagues out to fea. Unfortunately we 
are moil of us paffengers, with but one feaman and a boy 
or two on board to work the (hip ; to that for nine weeka. 
we have been driven about at the mercy of the winds and. 
waves ; all our provifions are gone, and many of us are, at. . 
this moment, dying with hunger." 

Immediately the good captain ordered out his boat, took., 
fome provifions, and went aboard the ihip, accompanied by/ 
Robinfon Crufoe. . . 

They foqnd the crew reduced to the moft deplorable 
condition poffible.: they all looked as if they were ffarved^

her face leaning againff one of the planks of the fhip's fide*

which he had gnawed away the greatell part.

this jdefil^able manner. ^ . 

Th^ were coming paflengeHB in ^is (hip from Axneri(^ 
fo England. The uhole crew (aid that they were very 
.worthy people. The mother was fo remarkably fpnd of her 
ibn» that ihe ref4ifed all manner o^ nourifliment purpbfely 
Jihat her (on might have fomediing to eat^ and this excellent 
young man had done the fame thin^^ in order to refene 
every thing for his mother. The faithful maid fervant u as 
more concerned for her mafler and miftrefs than for herJelf. 

They were'thoudit to be dead, all three, butp on exa- 
mination, squared to have (bme remains of life ; for, afbigr 
a few drops of broth had been forced ix\to their mouths> 
ihey iiegan, by degrees, to open their eyes. But the mo.- - 
ther was now tcx) weak to fwallow any thing j and (he made 
£giis .that they (hould confine their attentions to her fbn. I9, 
effed, ihe expired a few minutes after. 

The other two were brought to themfelves by the force 
0/ cordiab, and 9^ <they Were in the flower of their Age«. 
the captain, by hi>^ttentiye care, fua;eeded in reftorvag 
them to life. But wlien the young man turned his eyes 
upon his mother, and faw |hat (he was de^d, * the (hock 
made him fall again into a iWoon, from which it wsls very 
difficult to reoover him. However, they were fortunate 
enough to bring him to his fenfes again, and he was, in a 
ihort time^ .perfedly re-eftablifhed ; as was aHb the fervant- 
maid. 

The captain fijmiihed the (hip in diftrefs with all the 
provifions diat he could polTibly f|)are : he ordered his car- 
penter to put up mafts for them m the room of thofe that 
had been broken, and gave the crew proper inftrucaions for 
conveying .themfelves to the neareft land, which was that 
of the Madeira 1 (lands, tie bent his courfe thither alio,. 
on purpofe to take in more provifions. 

One of thefe iflands, you know, is called Madeira, frpnv 
which the reft take their name. 

Htmry. Yes,. I know it ; they belong to the Portugueze.

Mr. BilU They tumble the |;r^)es into a krge tub, and 
Aen tread upon them with their feet,, or bruife them witk

Havritt. Oh fie'! I ihaU not like to drink Madeira wine

As the captain was obliged to flop here fome time to re* 
pair 1:^ fhip, which had received a little damage, poor Ro^ 
oinfon, at the end of a few days, began to grow tired oT 
his iituation. His reillefs temper wanted fome change,, and 
he wiihed to luve wings that he might fly all over the world 
in as fhort a time as pofiible, 

Juft at this interval arrived a Portuguese (hip that came 
from Lisbon, and was bound for Brazil, in SouUi America.. 

H^nry (pointing ie the map). Is it not this country here,

and precious flones are found i 

Mr, Bill, The very fame* 

Robinfon got acquainted with the captain of thiff (hip». 
and hearing him talk of gold-duft and precious ftones, he 
would have given the world to make a voyage to Brazil; 
iviiere he thought he fhould fill his pockets if-ith diantondsk 



ROBIN^SON CRXTSOE. ag 

: Eiw. He did not know, I fuppofe, that in. that countnr 
pobody dares to gather gdd-dnft or precious ftones,r which 
Itre the folc property of the king of Portugal. 
• Mr. BflL And the reafon that he did not kno«r was, be^ 
caufe when; he waa young he would never learn any thing- 

Finding, therefore, that the Portugueze captain u as difc 
pofed to take him along with him as one of his crew, and 
that the £ngli(h (hip would be obliged to flop at leafl a 
fortnight longer, he could not refill his defire of rambling. 
He« dierefbre, told lus good friend,, the Engliih captain, 
, Jtvitly, that he was going to leave him, and to take » 
Myage to Brazil. The captain,^ who had learned from; 
-Ro^infon himfelf, a fhort time before, that he m as rambling 
thus about the world without the knowledge or confent of 
Jkis jwents, was glad to get rid of him. He agreed to take- 
Jlobinfon's venture,, which conMed of toys and hardware^ 
for the money that he had lent him in England, and gave* 
kim beiides all manner of good advice. 

Robinfim, therefore, went aboard the Portagueze; and 
now behold him failing for firazil.. They pafied pretty near 
the ifland of TeneriiF. 

Harriet, Where that high mountain is to be feen> called 
die Peak of Tcneriff ; eh, papa ?. 

Rich. Ay, ay, don't interrupt. 

Mr,, Bill. It was an admirable profpe^t, even long after 
fnn-fet in the evening, when all tne fea was covered withr 
^tooiny darknefs, to fee die top of that mountain, one of' 
the hi^heft in the whole wocld, ihine witlv the' rays of the: 
fim as if it had been all on fire* 

Some days after they faw another (ight upon' lite* fea,, 
which was very agreeable. A large number of flying fiflie 
rofe upon the furface of the water. They gliiteired like* 
.pojilhcd filver,.fo that they threw forth. a ftrong light <roa» 
.their bodies, as it were in rays. 

Charlotte. What, arc there fifhes that fly ? 

Mr. BilL Yes, Charlotte, and I think,. on- a certain d^r^ 
you and I faw one 

Geo. Ah, yes ; that was when we were in town» laft 
.Whitfuntide : but for all that, papa, it had neither feathv s 
nor wings. 

Mr. Bill. But it had a couple of long fins, whidl:fcrve 
k as wings when it rifes above the furfocc of th^ water.. 

For fcvcral days fucceflively the voyage wai avfine «&. 



poffibfe ; bat all of a fndden a vldent hurricane arofe fii»fn 
ttieSouth-Eafl. The waves frothed andtoTeinoiintaia high^ 
tofling the vdTel to and fro. This dreadfbl ftorm conttnmoA 
for fix days {vfice&vtly, and carried the fhip fo far oat df lier 
vrsy, that neither the captain nor any peHbn on board knew 
where they were. However^ by thdr reckorang» they fop- 
])ored that they could not be far from the Caribbee luandb*. 
They lie hereabouts.

Jll fke Children. Oh ! that will do. That is charming ! 
^ Mr. Bill. To proceed, therefore, with my fbry : 

The whole crew haflened upon deck to fee what land thia 
ivas ; but in the very moment their joy was changed into 
terror and confternation : the fhip ftnick, and all thofe vAt» 
were upon the deck received fo violent a ihock as almoft to 
throw diem backwards. 

Rieb. What was the matter ? 

Mr. BtiL The fhi|^ had run upon a fand-bank, and ftuck 
^ as fuddenly as if it had been nailed to the fpot. Then 
the foaming waves dafhed over the deck with fuch violence^ 
.that they were all obUged to take refuge in the cabin and 
between decks, for fear of being carried overboard. 

Nothing was now to be heara amongft the crew but la* 
mentable cries, groans, and fighs, that would have fbfteneft 
a heart of fbne. Some were praying, others wept aloudr 
ffome tore their hair like people in dei|>air, others were half 
dead and ftnpi^y infcnfible. Amongft this lafl clafs was

it impoflible to reach the ihore.. Neverthelefs, they exerted 
their whole ftrength in rowingj, and fortunately the wind 
drove them to^^^ards land. All at once they beheld a wave>

Here Mr. Billingfley made a fbp ; the whoFe company 
remained filent, and many of them could not help iighing 
with companion for the fate of the poor feamen. At

Robinfon was fwallowed up in the fea along witb the reft

wave, wh^ch had buried him in die dcep^ at its return drew 
him along with it^ and dafhed him towards the (here. He

Mr. BilL But why was I fo cruel to poor Edward, not to

Mr. Bill. That too 1 knew ; and, therefore,, I made yoii

Rich. Yes ; I believe it. Qod has a knowledge that is

Mr» Bill. Since, therefore, God loves all mankind as his. 
children, and is at the fame time fo wife that he alone knows 
what is really ufeful for us, it is impo£ible but he fhould do 
what is bed ibr our intereft. 

Geo. Without doubt, and Co he does continually.

Mr^ Bill. Unreafonable ! How? 

Riclt. Becaufe our Maker knows very well why he doe;i

Mr. Bill. The Ruler of the Univerfe had therefore reafon$

Robinfon Crufoe, But thcfe reafons are infcruuble to us < 
We may, indeed, carry our conjeAures to a certain lengthy

Forinftance^ infinite wifdom might Fortfce that a. longer

them from this world, and condafled their immortal fonts te- 
a place where they are happier than here. As for Robinfoa 
Crofoey probably his life was preferred to the end tl^ 
.afRiftion might oe a fchool of wifdom to him; for G6d,.

Keep this in remembrance, my dear child, through the

Henry. Did Robinfbm think fo upon that Occafidn ? 

Mr, Bill, Yes, then when he hard been rn fo great 
ofpertfhing', and fawhimfdf cut off from all tlie world, " 
he felt iincerelyhow unjuft and blamcable his condiift had 
been : then he prayed to Heaven, on his kneeSy. for pardon ; 
ted then he took the f^edfaft refbltition of amending his Jifot 
and of never doing any action contrary^ to the warmng of fab 
confcience. 

£dw. But what did he do after that ? 

Mr. Bill, When the joy tfeathe fek on his happy deBtc* 
ranee had a little fubfided^ he began to reflefl on his iituationb 
He looked about him, but could fee nothing except trees 
and thickets ; he could not perceive, on any fide, the leaft 
mark that the country was inhabited. 

This was a dreadful neceffity impofed upon him ; to Kve alt 
alone in a ftrange country ! But his anxiety was ftill more 
dreadfully increafed when this reflexion occurred to him>

Charlotte, What are favages, papa ? 

RU/j, Savages are wild men. Have you never heard talk

Alas! thefe poor people are fufficiently to be pitied, that

However^ the queflion was> Where muft he pafs the night } 
On the ground, under the open air ? There he would be . 
expofed to fayages or wild beaib that would devour him. 
Houfe, or cabin, or cave, he faw no figns of. He knew not 
what to do : his diftrefs brought tears into his eyes ; he prie4 
heartily. At length he refcTved to imitate the birds, atvd, 
like them, to feck a retreat in fome tree. Prefently he dif- 
cpvered one, the boughs of which were (o thick ^nd ib clofely 
interwoven, that he could fit an^ongft them» and even lay 
himfelf at his length very conveniently. He climbed up 
tliis tree, offered up an earneft prayer to his Maker j^ then 
fettled himfelf, ana fell afleep in a moment. 

While he flept, his heated imagination reprefeated to hifl». 
afrefh the tranfadlions of the preceding day. Difturbed with 
tumultuous dreams, he fancied he ftill faw die yasLVps fwelluig 
round him, and the fhip finking. The cries of th« feameor,

r^gctaMes, nbr mltk ; and> had he even been mafier of a 
joint bf meat, he had neither fire, hor fpit to roafl it on, nor 
pot to boil it in. All the trees that he had feen hitherto 
were log wood- trees, which n^ver bear any fruit. 

Rid. What fort of trees are thty, papa ? 

Mr^ Sill. Thefe are trees the wood of wluch is of conin 
^erable life in dying. They grow in fome countries of Soudi. 
America, and much of the logwood is brought to Europe. 
When it is boiled, the water turns of a reddiAi black colour^ 
and dyers make ufe of it to give a ihade to other colours. 

But to return to Robinfon Crufoe. 

Sdll uncertain what he fliould do, he came down from the 
tree. As he had eaten nothing the day before, hunger 
began to be exceedingly troublefome to him. He rar^ni 
about for feveral miles, but found nothing, except grafs^ 
and trees that bore no fruit. 

It was impoffible now to add to his diflrefs : ** Muft I, 
then, periih with hunger at laft!" cried he, fobbing and 
looking up towards Heaven. However, neceffity reanimated 
l^m with freih ftrength tp go and fearch carefully along the 
^ore for foteething eatable. 

But in vain : nothing but logwood-trees and Indian willowy 
nothing but graf^ and fand. At length, fatigued, weaken- 
ed, and exhaufted, he threw himfetf down with his face to 
the ground, burfl into tears, and wiihed that he had perifhed 
in the waVes of the fea rather than been preferved only to 
die^a raiftraWe death by hunger. 

He thought of nothing, therefore, now, but of waiting in 
this forlorn fituation for the flow and dreadful approach of 
death ; \vhen, turning by chance, he faw a cormorant de- 
vouring a fi(h that he had taken. Immediately he recolle^- 
cd that he had foraewhere read the following words : 

The Lord, who feeds with bounteous hand 

The feather'd tenants of the air. 
Will furely over man expand 

The wingt of his paternal care. 

He then reproached himfelf with having put fo little truft 
xn Divine Providence ; and, rifmg haftily, he determined to 
walk as far as ever his Ibength would permit him. He 
fhaped his courfe, therefore, along the fhore, and looked 
riarrowly about to difcover, if poffible, fomething that might 
fei^e him for food. 

At length he perceived a number of oyflcr-ihells lyitv^ 
on the ftiorc. He ran eagerly towards i\i^ ^i^oV^Vw«: ^^.^

were> and carefully examined all round it« hoping to find 
oyfters thereabouts. He did find fome, and hb }oy was ine3&- 
prefiible. 

Rich. Are there oyfters on land then ? 

Mr. Bill. Why no, not properly. On the contrary, they 
belong to the fea and lire in it. There they fallen them- 
felves to rocks, one upon another, in immenfe quantities* 
Such a heap of them is called a bed of oyfters. Not,Wy the 
waves, in dafliing againft this, loofens feveral of theoyfterts 
«nd the tide carries them towards the fhore. Afterwards^ 
when the tide ebbs, and it is low water, thefe oyfters are left 
on the beach, where it is then dry. 

Charlotte. You ^y when the tide ebbs, papa, what is that ? 

Harriet. What, don't you know that ? It is when the 
water that was fo high before, runs back, and grows quite 
Ihallow. 

Charlotte. What water? 

Harriet. Why, the fea-water, or a river like our Thameii 
where the tide comes up. 

Mr. Mercd. Charlotte, make your brother Richard explain 
that to you. He will be able to give you a clear idea of it. 

Rich. Who, I ? Well, I will do my beft. Have you never 
obferved that the water of the Thames rifes fometimes pretty 
high at the bottom of our garden ; and then, after a while, 
fans back and leaves the ground dry ; fo that one can walk 
where it was but a little time before covered with water ? 

Charlotte. Oh, yes ! now 1 remember to have feen it. 

Rich. Well, when the water rifes in that manner, it is 
called the tide, or the flowing of the tide ; and when it falls 
back and leaves the ground dry, it is called the ebb. Thai 
we fay the tide ebbs and flows. 

Mr. Bill. Befides this, you muft know, my dear Charlotte, 
that, in the courfe of four and twenty hours, the water of 
the foa rifes thus twice and falls twice. It continues to 
rife for a little more than fix hours, and then to fink for a little 
more than fix hours. The hours during which it rifes, are 
called the time of the flow, and the hours during which it 
falls, are called die time of the ebb. Do you underfland it 
now? 

Charlotte. Yes ; but why does the fea always rife fo ? 
. Geo. I think I have heard the reafon. It is faid, the 
noon attradb the waters, in fuch a manner, that they are 
•obliged to rife. 

lil*w. Oh ! we have often heard that. Let papa go on« 

Mr. Biih 



ROBINSOK CRUSOS* jf 

Mir.. Bill. Anotlier tiine, Charlotte, I will tell you more 
•pon this fubjed. 

Robinibn was almpft oat of his wits for joy at having found 
ibmetliing to appeafe his raging hunger. The oyfters that 
he found did not» it is true^ ferve to fill his beljy ; but he 
was fatis&ed with having found fomething which barely made 
him forget his hunger as it were. 

His greateft uneafineis was next to know where he Ihould 

dwdil for the future, tp be free from all dread of lavages and 

wild beails. His firfl bed had been fo inconvenient, that he 

could not think of his condition without (huddcr'ing, if ho 

fhould be obliged to pafs all his nights in the fame manner. 

Gfo. Oh ! I know very well what 1 would have done. 

Mr. BUI. \^fell, ^hajjjyould you have done ? Inform us. 

Gio. In the fir^ plad&» I would have builva houfe, with 

walls as thick as that, and with iron gates — fo ftrong I— 

And then I would have made a ditch all round with a draw^* 

bridge, and this drawbridge I would have lifted up every 

nigbt, and then. the lavages muft be pretty cunning if they 

could have done me any harm while I was aflee^. 

Mr. Bill. Here is fine talking ! It is a pity that you had 
pot been there. You would have, been able lo give poor 
Robinlon excellent advice. — But — anfwer me one thing- 
Have you ever carefully obferved how carpenters and mafons 
go about building a houfe ? 

Ge9* Oh ! yes, many a time. The mafon begins with 
preparing the lime and mixing fand with it, Then he lays one 
iloiie upon another, an^ with his trowel puts mortar between 
them to keep them firmly together. Next the csipenters, 
with their hatch ets, cut out the rafters and place them care- 
fully. Then, by means of a pulley, they raife the beams to 
the height pf the wall and join them. Afterwards they faw 
the boards for the floors, and make laths, which they nail to 

tlie rafters in order to place the tiles. And then 

Mr. Bill, I fee you have taken particular notice how they 
"go about building a houfe. But then a mafon makes ufe of 
ume, and a trowel, and bricks ; or elfe ftones, which muft 
firll be cut into form : and carpenters have occafion for 
hatchets, and faws, and chifels, and nails, and hammers. 
W here would you have found all thel'e, if you ha 1 been in 
Kobinfon's place? 

Geo, Why — really I don't know. 

Mr. Bill, Neither did Robinfon> and for that reafon he 



40 T H X K E W 

^was obliged to give up the fi^eme of building a real botife. 
He had not a fingle tooHn the world ; nothing but hu tv^ 
hands, and with Siefe alone people do not build 6idi hoofes 
as we live in. 

Einv. Why, then» he had only to make Mmfelf a little 
hut with the branches that he could have plucked from die 
trees, 

- Mr. Bill. And could a little hut, made of branches, have 
-defended him from ferpents, wolves, tigers, pantibers, Ikms, 
and other fierce beafts of prey ? 

Rich. Ah i pMoor Robinion, how will you manage in dus 
diftrefsful iituation ? 

Edw. Could he (hoot ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, if he had had only a gun, with powder and 
ball ; but once more I tell you, the poor lad had nodiing 
-^abiblutely nothing but his two hands to depend on* 
* When he viewed his fituation, and faw that all refonrces 
failed him, he fell again into his former defpondency, '* To 
what purpofe," faid he within himfelf, <« have I hitherto 
efcaped perifliing with hunger, £nce, perhaps, dus very 
night wild beafb will tear me to jpieces?'* 

He even ftnded (fuch is the force of the imagination) 

that a furious tiger was before him, u ith its dreadful jaws 

^open and ready to devour him. Thinking that the tiger 

had him already by the throat, he cried out, ^' Oh ! my 

poor father and mother," and fell to the ground half dead. 

After having lain there fome tirxie in an aeony of grief 
and delpair, h^ recolleded a hymn which he had heard Ids 
excelleh't mother ibmedmes fin^, when fhe had any preflbre 
of affli^n on her nund. It began thus : 

He who beneath HeavVs guardian wing 

Hath wifely fixt hit place. 
May to his foul thus freely iingy 

When forrows come apace; 

In God*s ecerna} ProvideDce 

My hope redemption fees. : 
Bleft with fo po«*iful a defenoei 

My foul, be thou at eafe. 

The refle£^ns contained in thefe words (bengdiened 
him confiderably. Two or three times he repeated thefe 
beaudful lines to himfelf with much devotion ; after which 
he exerted his ftrengdi to rife, and went upon anodier fearch, 

en* 



XOBINSOM CRU80£. 41 

eo4caYoaring to find fome cave that might ferve him as z 
Ikfe retreat. 

' £ut in vfhsLt.p9Tt of the world was he ? In South Ame- 
rica, or clfevvherc ? Was he upon an illand or a continent ? 
This was more than he could tell as yet himfclf ; but he fa^ 
a pretty high hill at a diflance, and he walked tOAords it. 

As he. went along, he made this forrowful discovery, that 
the whole country produced nothing but ^ral's and trees 
which bore no fruit. It is cafy-to ir.iaginc what gloomy 
ideas a fight like this ini^ired him with. 

* He climbed up, with^ fome difficulty, to the top of the 
hill, which was pretty high, and from uhich he could fee 
all round him to die dilUnce of feveral leagues. «To his 
great mortification, he perceived that he was really in .an 
ifland, within fight of which there appeared no other land, 
except two or three fmall iflands that rofe out of the fea at 
the difiance of a few leagues. 

** P'jor, unhappy wretch that I am !" cried he, lifting 
flowly his trembling hands towards Heaven : " I am, tiien, 
feparated, cut off from all men, and have no hopes of be- 
ing ever delivered from this favage place. Gh ! my poor 
afliifled parents, 1 fhall, then^ never fee you more 1 I 
(hall never be . able to aflc you forgivenefs' for my folly ! 
Never ftiall I hear the fweet voice of a friend, of a man ! 
—But I deferve my fate," continued he. *' Oh Lord, 
thou ait juft in all thy^ways I I ihould but deceive myfelf 
were I to complain. It is I myfelf that have made my lot 
{q miferable." 

'In this mournful filence he continued on the fpot, with 
His eyes fixed, as it were, to the ground. *« Cut off 
fron\ God and man !" was the only refledlion that pofTeffed 
his mind. At length, however, thoughts more rational and 
confoliiig came to his relief. He threw himfelf upon his^ 
knees, lifted up his heart to Heaven, promifed to oe pa* 
tient and refigned to his difbreffes, and prayed for ftrength 
to fupport them. 

Harriet, It was a good thing, however, that Robinfon 
could fay his prayers in the time of diftrefs. 

Mr. Bill, Certainly it was happy for him. What would 
have become of him, then, if he had not known that God 
is the Father of all mankind ; that he is fupremely good, 
almighty, and omniprefcnt ! He would have funk under " 
ius terror and detpair, if he had not formerly been taught .

thcCc great and comfortable truths. Bot the idea "of hit 
heavei3y Father's goodnefs gave him conftantly frefh cou« 
rage and confolation, whenever his diftrefles wer6 upon the 
point of overpowering his refolution. 

He now found himlelf much ftrengthened, and began t& 
travel round the hill. All his fearch was, for a long time, 
ufclefs : he could find no {)lace where he might be in fafety. 
At length, he came to a little hill, which, m front, was ai 
ffeep as a wall. In examining this (pot attentively, he found 
a place that feemed to be hollowed in under the hill, u ith 
a pretty narrow entrance to it. 

If he had had a pickaxe, a crow, and other tools, it 
v^ould have been an eafy matter to hollow out a complete 
dwelling under the rock, which was partly done by natture ; 
but he had none of thcfe tools. The queilion was, then, 
how he ftionld fiipply the want of them. 

After puzzling his head a long time, he began to reflect 
in this manner : *' Some of the trees that f fee here are 
like the willows of rtiy country, which are eafily tranf{dant- 
ed. I will pluck up a number of thefe young trees, and 
here, before this hole, I will pl^nt them dofe together, fo 
that they may form a fort of wall. When they grow up 
pretty high, 1 fhall be able to deep within this enclpfure as 
fafely as if I was in a houfe ; for -behind, the ^eep wall 
of this rock will fecure me, and in front, as well as on both 
iides, the dofe row of trees ^Ul keep off all danger." 

This happy thought pleafed him very touch, and he im- 
mediately fet about putting it in execution. His jew wai 
(fill greater when he faw, not far from that fpot,' a bean* 
tiful and clear fpring bubbling out from the fide of the hill. 
He haftened tg quench his thirft at it, being extremely dry, 
as he had run about a good ^eal during the hotteft time of 
the day. 
^ Geo. Was it fo very warm, then, in the ifland? 

Mr, Bill. Yes, you may eafily imagine that it was warm. 
Look here, (pointing to the map,) this is the coaft of South 
America, near which, probably, was iituated the ifland on 
which Robinfon was caft away. Now, you fee, this part is 
not fdLT from the equinoflial line> where the fun is fometimes 
direftly over people's heads. It is, therefore, natural to 
fuppofe that all that quarter mufl be extremely hot. 

Kobinfon now fet about plucking up out of the groondt 
with his hands» fome of the young trees that I mentioned 

before^

carried them to the place that he had deftined for \\u dv\ Lul-

ground for each of his trees, and as this work went on bat 
very flowly, the day dofed by the time that he had fixci 
five or £x of them. 

After he had finiftied his work, hunger obliged him to 
walk down towards the fhore in order to fearch for oyilcrs ; 
but, unfortunately, the tide was up, (o that he found none* 
a|id %^s forced for this time to ^ to bed fupperlefs. But 
where was his bed ? — He determined, until he could £niih 
for himfelf a complete and fecure habitation, to lie every 
iii^t in the tree in which he had lain the lail night. 

But, that he might not be e^cf^dk to the fame accident

44^ THE NEW 



FOURTH EVENING. 



][/TR» BILL, Well, my dears, wte/e did we leave Robin- 
^ -^ fon Crufoe lall night ? 

Rich. We left him like a bird perched in a tree to take 
his night's reft. 

Mr. Bill. Very well. To proceed, then, withjiis flory: 
Every thing went on that night as well as poflible ; he had 
no fall, and flcpt foundly till morning. . ' 

At break of day, the firft thing that he did wias to fct 
off towards the Ihore to look for oyfters, intending after- 
wards to return to his work. He happened this time to go 
another way, and, as he walked along, was overjoyed to 
find a tree which bore large fruit. It is true, he did not 
as yet know what they might be ; but he hoped to find 
them^ood for eating, and therefore, to make atrial, he 
knocked down one. 

It was a large nut, fomething of a triangular form, and 
as big as a young child's head. The outward rind was 
compofed of filaments, or flringy folds,, as if made of hemp. 
The fecond hu{k or fheil was, on the contrary, almofliat 
hard as the fhell of a tortoife, and Robinfon foon perceired 
that it would ferve him for a cup. This fhell is fo large 
that it fomctixnes affords a place of retirement to the little 
long-tailed American monkey. The fruit within was a 
fort of juicy kernel, which tafted like a fv* eet almond, and 
in the middle of this kernel, which was hollow, he found a 
ihofl delicious and finely flavoured milk. This was a moft 
aglreeable treat for poor Robinfon, who was half flarvcd. 

His. empty flomach was not fatisfied With one nut ; he 
knocked down a fecond, which he ate with equal greedi- 
«£ii. His joy at having difcovered this excellent fruit 
M>ught tears into his eyes, and he looked up to Heaven 
with fenfations of the warmeft gratitude. 

The tree was tolerably large, and quite hung with fruity 
but, alas ! it was the only one in the whole ifland. 

Ce0* What fort of a tree might it be, then ? We have 
none fuch here. 
Mr. Bill. It was a cocoa-nut tree. They grow chiefly

There are fome of them found in the Weft Indies ; indeed^ 
they are pretty common there. 

Though Robinfb^'s hunger was now Satisfied, yet he did 
not omit going down to Sie ihore, to iee what ihew the 
oyfters made that day. He found a few> indeed, but far too 
Cbw to afibrd him a hearty meal. He had, therefore^ great 
xea(bn to thank .God for having this day fumiihed him 
with another fort of food ; and he did So with a heart full of 
, gratitude. 

He carried home for his dinner the oyfters that he had 
found, and went chearfully about his yefterday's work a*

he would not have paid any attention to fuch matters, but, 
. at prefent, nothing was indifferent to him. He examined 
€Yery thing, and rdje^ed on every thing, in order, if pof- 
' fibk, to apply evtry thing to advantage* 

Having kmc hopes that this plant might be ofed in th# 
fajne manner as Bax or hemp, he pluckS a quantity of it, 
tied it up in fmall bundksj and left them to loak in water* 
Having Qbferved, at the end of a few days, that the thick 
outiide fkin was fufficiently foftened by the water, he dre^v 
. out the bundles^ and fjjpread them thinly on the giafs before 
the fun, the fialks bemg now quite foft. As fbon as ever 
they were properly dried, he made a trial with a large 
. Sack to pound them and fcoreak them like flax, smd he fuc* 
ceeded. 

Immediately he endeavoured to turn the firing^r part 
of thefe plants to nfe by making finall cords of it. It 
is tme they were not ib well t^ed as thofe inade by 
our vope-makers here, for he had neither wheel nor a 
fecond perfon to affift him* However, they were fboog 
enoaffh to faiften his great fheU to the end of a ftick, by 
which means he was now mailer of an infirument not mucA 
Onlike a gasdener's fpade. 

He thfiQ went on with his work very ^ic^ently, and 
planted tree jdok by tree until he had completely palifaded 
the fp|ape that was befoi^e his intended dwelling. But, as

€cient wall of defence, he (pared no laboixr, bat planted 'a 
fecond row round the firft. He then interwove the branches 
of the two rows together, and, at laft, hit upon the idea of 
filling up with earth the dillance that was between them. 
This completed his wall, ib folid that it would have re* 
quired a coniiderable force to pu(h it in. 

Every morning and evening he watered his little plan- 
tation with water from the neighbouring fpring, which he 
took up in his cocoa-(hell ; and he had very foon the fatis- - 
fa6lion of feeing his young trees fprout up and flourifh to 
as to afford a charming view to the eye. 

When he had almofl entirely finifhed his hedge^ he fpent 
a >yhole day in making a number of thick cords,, oat of 
which he formed, as well as he could, a ladder of ropes. 

Henfy. What was that for ? 

Mr, Bill, ril tell you. His defign was to mfkt no door 
to his habitation, but to plant more trees, and fo Hop up 
even the opening that remained. 

Henry, How, then, was he to go in and out? 

Mr. Bill. By the affiftance of his ladder of ropes. ' 

It is to be obierved, that the rock which hang over Us 

• habitation Was' about as high as the fecond ftory of a houfe» 

• aiikd 6ti the top of the rock was a tree. To this he fattened 
his ladder of ropes, and let it hang down to the ground. 
He then tried to climb up by it, and fucceeded to admi- 

;xaoon. • * 

All this being finifhed, he confidered by what means he 
' might make the little hollow aoder the rock large enough 
to fcrv'c him for a habitation. He faw very well, that«with 
his hands alone he fbculd never be able to manage it. What 
was to be done, then ? He mufl find out fome tool or in- 
ftrument for the purpofe. 

With this dcfign he repaired to a fpot where he had fcen 

• a great number of hard green flohes'fcattered on the ground. 
' Havin?? learched amongfl them carefully, he at laft fotmd 

one, the very iight of which made him jump for joy ; for, 
in tfteft, this ftone had the very form of a hatchet, aAd 

• even a hole to fit the handle in. Robinfon faw, at firfl 
view, that it would make an excellent hatchet, if he could 
but enlarge the hole ever fo little. After a world of pains 
he at length happily accompHfhed this by means of ano- 
ther flone ; then he fixed a pretty thick ftick in it, by 
way of handle, and with fome of the cord which he h^ 

made

made himfelf> he faftened it as firm as if it had been nailed 
in. 

He now tried to fell a fmall tree, and the attempt proving: 
no ie(s foccefsfal, filled him with inexprefiible 'joy. Had 
any one ofiered him one hundred pounds for his hatchet, he 
would not have parted with it, fuch vail advantages did her 
promife himfelf from the ufe of it. 

Searching KHll amongft thofe green flones, he found two 
more tquall]( fit for ufe. The one had nearly the form of a 
mallet, fuch as is ufed by carpenters and flone-cutters ; the 
other was fhaped like a flout ihort bludgeon, having an ed^e 
or comer at the end; Robinfon carried them both to his 
habiudon, intending to go to work with them immediately • 

He fucceeded to his wiih. Laying the edge of the one 
flonc upon die earth and rock, and ftriking it with the other 
refembling a mallet, he knocked off feveral pieces of the 
rock, and, in a few days, was fo far advanced in clearing out 
the hollow, that it fcemed large enough for him to lie in at 
biseafe. 

He had before this phKked up with his hands a quarrtitjr 
of grafs, which h^ had fpread before the fun to make hay of 
k. This bein^ now fi^ciendy dried, he carried it to hi»^ 
cave to make himfelf a good bed^ 

From this time he was able to fleep like a hranan- creature^ 
without bfing obliged, as he had for many nights before,. t» 
perch like a bird up in a tree. What a luxury it was to hin» 
to flrctch his. weary limbs upon a? {ok bed of hay ! He thank- 
ed God, and faid within himfelf, *rOh 1 if my couhtr>^'mcn? 
knew what it is to pafs, as I have 4one,' feveral nights itrc- 
' ceffively, fea^d' upon a hard branch of a tree, how happy 
would they count ihemfelves to be able to enjoy the rcfreAt- 
jnent of fleep in convenient beds, fecure from acckkntst hy 
felling or otherwife ! Certainly they would not let flip a dajr 
without fmcerely thanking PiKjvidence for all the conveniens 
cies and delights. which they enjoy. '^ 

The following day wa« Sunday. Robinfon^ dedicated it 
to reft, to prayer, and medkatioii* He fpent whole hours oni 
his knees, with hi* eyes turned towards Heav«i, praying to* 
God to pardon his iinsr »id to blefs and coihfbrt his poo?- 
parentSi. Then with tears of joy „ he thanked hi& Maker fbxr 
th«^ providential affiftance that he hadexperieneedtin^a-fitaa-

Mr. SilL Providence fore&w that lie wonld grow better

It is not in his anger^ but in his tender mercy> that he iesds 
us misfortunes : he knows that they are neceilary to ua^ in 
order to render m humbler and better. Far from being 
hurtful to us^ they become (alutary remedies i^his b^cficent 
liands* 

That he might not forget the order of days, but Imovr 
legularly on whiat day Sunday would f«ll> Robmibn thought 
of making hunfelf an almanack. 

Rich* An almanack ? 

^* Bill, Yes ; not a printed one> it is tFue» nor quite (b 
^itiA as thofe that we have in Europe, but.ftill an almanack 
by which he was abk to count the days regularly. 

Rich. And how did he manage that ? 

Mr. BilL Having neither paper nor any thing eUe reqni- 
fite for writing, he chofe four trees that were dofe befide 
each other, and pretty fmooth on the bark. On the hurgeft 
of the four he marked cvtry evening a notdi, to fignify tikat 
a day was pad. When he had made feven notches, die 
week was expired. Then he cut in the next tree another 
notch, to exprefs a week. As often as he had com|^eted in 
the fecond tree four notches, he marked on the third, with a 
notch of the fame fort, the revolution of a whole month ; 
and, laflly, when thefe marks that ftood for months amonnt- 
od to twelve in number, he made a feore on the fourth tree, 
to denote that the whole year was ex{»red. 

Henry, But all the months are AQt eqoafly long : fome 
have thirty-one days, others but thirty : how then could he 
mark tx^My the number of days in each } 

Mr. Bill, lliat he could reckon on his fingers. 

Rich. On his fingers ? 

Mr. BiU. Yes ; and, if yon ch^e, I will ihew you how too. 

Jlltbi CbiUriu. Oh ! dear papa, do. 

Mr. Bill. Well, then, obferve. He (hut his Uft hajwU & ; 
then, with the fore finger of hb right hand, he touched one 
of the knuckles or finger joints of the left, and then the lu>l- 
low that is befide it, and fb on, nammg the mondis in *heir 
order. Every month that falls upon a knndde has thirty- 
one dajt, whereas the others which fall upon the hollows

tb« Sabbath fell, that he might keep it holy, after the i 
nerofChrifHans. 

In the mean time^ he had nfed the greateft part of the cocoa 
nnts that he had ftored up, having difcovered bat one tree 
of the kind, as yet, and the fhore fomiihed him with fo few 
oyfters, that they were not fuffici^iit to keep him aHyc* He 
be^n, therefore, to be oneafy again concerning the article 
of food. 

Hitherto fearful and cautious, he had not dared to go to^ 
any great diftance from his dwelling. The dread of wild 
beafts, or of men not much more civilized, if any were to be 
ibund in the country, kept him at home ; but neceffity ^at 
length obliged him to conquer his reluctance, and to walk a 
little farther into the ifland, in order, if poffible, to difcover a 
new ftock of provifions. With this intent he refolved, the 
followingday, with God's bleffing and protdi£ti6n, to traverle 
- ihe whole ifland. 

But, in order to defend himfelf from the exceflivc heat of 
the fun, he fpent the whde evening making an umbrella.^ 
£dw. Where did he find filk and whalebone ? 
Mr. Bill* He had neither filk nor whalebone ; nor had he 

either knife, fciffars, needle, or thread; and vet but 

bow do you thiok he ist about making an umbrella ? • 
^^if. That icannot tell. ' ^ • . 

Mr. Bill. He wove the top of it with fprigs of willow,. Kke 
a large round baiket, not very deep : in the middle of tJiis he 
fixed a iHck which he tied with his packthread, and then he 
went to the cotoa-nut tree for fome large leaves, which he 
kiilened with pins to tne outfide. t 

jKicJi^. With pins? Where had he thofe pins? 
Mr.Bili.Giiefs. 

Harriet. Oh, 1 can telU He found them among the 
iweepings, or between the chinks of the fk)or. I find a good 
many there. 

Rich. A wife difcovery ! As if one could find pins where 
there was nobody to lofe them ! Beiides, what fweepings. 
tould there be, or what floor in Robinfon^s little cave } . 

' Mr. Bdl. Well, who can guefs ? How would you do if 
you wanted to fallen any thing and had no pins ? 

Rich. I would ttfe diprns, mch as grow on the hawthorn<«

J/r, Sitf. 



ROBINSON C k U S O £. 5I 

Mr. Sm, Pretty well both ; however, I muft tell yoo, that 
Robinfon afed neither the one nor the odier, b^ reafon that he 
never (aw either hawthorn or eoofeberry tree in all his iiland. 

Ricb. What then did he ufe ? " 

Mr JBilL Fiih bones. The Tea threw dead fifhes up 9n 
the beach, ffoiS time to time, and when their bodies rotted 
away or were devoured by birds of prey, their hopes remain- 
ed dry^* Of thefe Robinfon had gathered fome of the 
Ihxmgeft and fharpeft to ufe as jpins. ^ • 

By means of them he contrived to make up an umbrella 
fb dofc thflt not a fingle ray of the fun could penetrate it. 
MHienever any new piece of work fucceeded with him, his 
joy was inexpreffible ; then he ufed to fay to himfelf, " Have 
not I been a great fool to pafs the beft part of my youth in 
idlenefs ? On ! if I were m Europe now, and had all thofe 
tools at my command that are fo eafy to be procured there> 
what things I could make for myfelf 1 And what a pleafure 
it would be to me to make up myfelf the greateft part of my 
furniture, and the working-tools that I fhould have occafion 
for." 

As it was n©t very late, he bethougiTt himfelf of trying to 
make a bag that might hold his provifion, if he fliould be fo 
lucky as te find any in his excurfion. He turned this fcheme 
in his thoughts for a while, and at length fucceeded in finding 
means to accomplifti it. 

You muft know, he had made a tolerable good ftock of 
packthread ; of this he refolved to weave a piecf of network, 
and of the network to make a bag. 

Now it was thus be fet about it. He fattened acrofs> 
between two trees that w:rre little more than a yard afundeV,. 
feveral threads, one under the c*wher, and as clofe as poffible. 
: . Tfiis refembled exa^ly what weavers call the fwarp. In the 
next place/ he joined regularly, from top to bottom, thread 
with thread, ftiU as clofe as poflible, knotting the thread that 
went down with each thread that went acroS, exadly in the 
fame manner as when one weaves a net. Thefe threads, 
therefore, that went downwards, formed what is called the 
tuoe/; and by thisHbrt of workmanihip he in a (hort time 
completed a piece of netting not unlike fuch as filhermen ufe. 
He next flipped off the ends of the threads from the.trees to 
which they were fattened, and joined the fides of the netting 
together, clofing up the bottom ; thus he left no part open 
but the top» Here was a bag or pouch complete^ which he 



, $1 T H E N JK ,W 

hang by his fide, having fai^ened both cads of a ftoat pieee 
of packthre^ to the mouth* and flipping the loop overhii 
neck. 

*nie happy fuccefs of his labour filled him with fb iniich 
joy that he^as Ccarce able to dofe his eyes all night. 

Geo. I fhopld like to have fuch a bag usist^* 

Erinjif, So (hould I too, if we had only feme packthread. 

Mn. B3L If you wifh to enjov as much iadsladion from 
^our work as Robinfon Crufoe (M from his« you fhould begin 
with making the packthread yoUrfelves, and you yourfelves 
ihoold prepare the hemp or the flax for that porpofe ; bat as 
there is neithlbr flax nor hemp ripe at this time of the year, I 
.will famUh you with packthread. 

Geo. Oh I dear mama> will you be fo good? 

Mrs, Bill. Yes, my dear, if you defire it. 

Geo. That is deliffhtful. 

Harrut. You are*£)ing what is very right ; for if ever yoi 
flioald happen to be in an ifland where there was not a living 
ibul but yourfelf, you know beforehand how to fet jd)oat faeh 
things ; eh, papa ? 

Mr, Bill. Right. Well, make a trial. Ab to Robinfim^ 
we will let him fleep till to-morrow. In the mean time, we 
(hall fee if it is not poilible to be as cunning as he, and t» 
make an umbrella. 



FIFTH EVENING. 

THE next evening, the company beii^ aflembled in fbe

of netwcM-k that he 9iade himfelf, and which drew the eyts of 
the whole company upon him. Inflead of an umbreLhi, he 
JmuI borrowed a,£eve fcom the cook, and ftuck a» broomftick

Then he who (hall have beft performed the feveral pieces of

will make him a prefent tf the umbrella. 

Geo. And mufl he really make a cave too, or a hut ? 

Mr. Bill. Why not? 

Jill ike Children. Oh, that is excellent 1 that is delightful ! 

Mr. Bill, Robinfon could fcarce wait for the daylight. 
He rofe before the fun, and prepared for his journey. He 
flipped Ids poBch-fhing over his neck, put a ftrong cord 
round his wa'fl by way of girdle, in which he ftuck his 
hatchet inflead of fji^ord. took his umbrella upon his fhpulder, 
and fb conrageoufly began his march. 

He firft p^ a vlfit to his cocoa-nut tree, to fumilh his bag 
with a nut or two. Provided with fome of this excellent 
food, he went fh-aight down to the fea-fide to feek alfo fome 
oyfters ; and, having got a fmall fbre of thefe two articles, 
in cafe of neceflity', he took a (light breakfaft, with a drink 
of freih water from his fpring, and* marched o^. 

The morning was delightful ; the fun was juft then rifing 
in all his glory, and feemed as if he afcended out of the fea« 
A thonfand birds, of different forts« and the greateft'variet/ 
' of admvable plumage, were then finging their morning fong, 
and rejoicing at the return of light. The air was as Dure 
and as frelh as if it had been but jufl then created, ana the 
plants and flowers exhaled the moft exquifite perfiime. 

Robinfon felt his heart expand with joy zaA gratitude. 
«* Even here/' iiud he, <' even here doth the Creator of the 
Univerfe ihew hin^elf the moil beneficent of beings I"— • 
He then mixed his voice with the melody of the birds, and 
fttw a m<mung hymn, which he had fotmesXy learnt, and 
fturetaiiied'in memory. 

As his ftar of wild animalsi whether men cr beaft«» was 



54 THE NEW 

not yet Andrei/ di(fipated> he avoided, in his walk^ as mndi 
as poffible, all forefts and thickets, chiSinf, on the contrary^ 
fucn grounds as allowed him an open proiped <m every fide; 
but unfortunately thefe grounds were the barreneft parts of 
the whole ifland, fo that he had gone a pretty kmg way with- 
out finding any thing that couM repay him for his tronble, 
or be the leafl fervieeable to him. 

At lall he obferved a parcel of plants, which he refolv^d to 
infpeft a little clofer : they were growing together in tofts, 
and formed a kind of little coppice. Some had reddiih 
blofToms, others white ; a third fort> inltead of bloilbras, were 
covered with little green apples, about the fize of a cherry. 

He eagerly bit one of thefe apples, but found it unfit fof/ 
eating, which fo vexed him, that he plucked up th^ whole 
tuft, and was going to iiing it away, with all his force, when 
he perceived, to his great furprize, a number of ronnd knobs 
hanging from the roots of the tuft. He immediately fuf- 
pecled that thefe were properly the fruit of the pUmt, and, 
therefore, began to examine them* 

But, however, this time his taile difappointed him ; . the 
fruit was hard and difagreeable to the palace. Robinfbnhad 
a mind to thro^v the whole away ; but fortunately he rccol- 
lefted that a thing fhould not be reckoned abfolutely ufele(s, 
becaufe we cannot all at once difcovcr the utility of it. He„ 
therefore, put a few of thefe knobbed fruit into his pouch| 
iuid continued his walic. 

Ricb, I kno-v what thefe knobbed fruit wei-c* 

Mr. Bill, Come, what do you think they were i' 

Rich, Why, xhzy were potatoes ; they gra v exa6Uy as you 
have defcribed thefe knobs-. 

HfHry. And America is their original foil too. 

Geb» Ay, it was from that country that Sir Francis Drake 
brought them. Bat Roblnfon wa^ very ilajpid not to knov^

Mr, Bill. Would you know them ? 

Gc0, Law I I have feen potatoes,, and eat of them a hun-

Mr. Bill. But Robinfon had, perliaps,. never feen a-nyof

ROBINSON CRUSOl. 55 

Crro» Oh! then 1 beg his pardon. ' 

Mr, Bfii.You fee, my dear George, how wrong ip is to be 
too hafty in blaming others. We fliould always put ourfelves 
in their place, and firft a(k the queftion if u e coiild have done 
better ^han they. If you yourfelf had never feen potatoes, 
nor heard in what manner they (hould be dreft, you would 
have begi as muth puzzled as Robinfon to find out the ufe 
of them. Let this teach you never to think yourfelf cleverer 
than other people. 

Geo, Itfhall, papa. 

Mr, Bill. Robimon continued his walk, but very flowly, 
and with a great deal of caution. The lead noife, made by 
the wind in fhaking the trees and the thickets, ilartled him, 
and made him put his hand to his hatchet to defend himfelf 
in cafe of need. But he always faw, to his great joy, that 
Lis fright was without foundation. 

At length he arrived on the banks of a rivulet, where he 

~refolved to make his dinner. He feated himfelf at the foot 

of a large branchy tree, and was juil going to regale himfelf 

heartily, when, all at once, a noife, at a (uflance, threw him 

again into a terrible fright. 

He looked round wiu terror in his countenance^ and« at 
« length,' perceived a whole troop of— 

• • £Jw, Oh la ! favages, 1 fuppofe. 

Gso. Or elfe lions and tigers, 

Mr. Bill. Neither one nor the other ; but a troop of wild 
animals, which have fome refemblance to our (heep, except 
that on their back they bear a fmall bunch like diat of a 
cameL As to their fize, they were very little larger than a 
iheep. If you would wifti to know what thefe animals were, 
■ and now they were called, I will tell you. 

Rich. Oh ! yes, papa, if you pleafe. 

Mr, Bill. They are called lamas ; their country is properly 
that part of America which belongs to the Spaniards, and is 
called Peru. There, before the difcovery of that extenfive 

* country by Francis Pizarro and Almagro, the Peruvians had . 
tamed this animal, and were accuftpmed to load it> and ife 
it for a beaft of burthen, as we do horfes and mules. Of its 
wool they made fhifEs for cloathing. 

Rich. Then the people of Peru were not fo favage as the 
other Americans. 

"" Mr. Bill. Not by a great deal. They lived in hoofes 
properly built ; as did alfo the Mexicans (here in North

proach, felt a violent defire to eat fomc roaft meat, which he 
had not tafted for fo long a time. He thought, therefore, of 
killing one of thefe lamas ; and for that purpofe he Hood clofc 
beAde the tree, with his hatchet of flint in his hand, waiting 
until the bead (hould, perliaps, pafs fo clofe to him, that li^- 
might ftrike it with his hatchet. 

ft happened as he expefted. Thefe animals, walEung on 
without fufpicion, and probably having never been diilurbed 
by any living creature, paflTed by, free from the leafl dread of 
danger, clofe to the tree where Robinfon ftood in ambufcade; 
and oacof the fm:illcil of them coming v/ithin his reach, he 
gave it fo efFji^ual :> liroke 0.1 the na^s of the neck, that h/e 
hid it dead in a moment. 

Harriet, Oh (y \ how could he do fo ? The pooir little 
iheep! 

Mn. BiJh And why fhouldhe not, Harriet ? ' 

Harriet, Nay, the poor little thing had done him no harin> 
however ; and fo he might vtry well have let it live • 

Mrs, Bill, Certainly, he might fo; but he had occafion 
for the fleih of this animal for his food and nourifhment ; and 
do|b thou not know, that God hath permitted us to make ofc 
of animals whenever we have the like occafion ? 

Mr, Bill. To kill anv living creature without neceffity, or 
to torture it, even barely to teaze it, is cruelty, and ho f^oi 
' perfon will do fo ; but to draw all the advantage poffihle 
from them, and even to kill them and ufe their flefb for our 
nourifhment, is not forbidden. Befides, do not you know, 
as I explained to you the other day, that it is very well for 
animals that we fhould thus deal with them ? 

Ritb. Ah! very triic : )f we had no occafion for animab> 
' we Ihonld not take care of ^m, and in that cafe they would 
not be near fo well o^ as at prefent. How many of them 
woold be flarved to death in a hard winter ? * 

Henry, Yes ; and they would fuffer ftill more if they were 
not killed, but left to die of (icknefs and old-age» because 
they cannot affiil each other as xnen do. 

Mr. Bill. Again, we mufl not fugpoie tkat t)ic death to 

which 



R O B I,pr S O N CRUSOE. 57 

which we put animals caufes them a great deal of pain. 
They are not fenfible beforehand that they arc going to be 
killed, (6 that they are quiet and contented to the very laft 
moment; and the feeling of pain, while they are killing, is 
foon pall. :^ 

Robinfbn ftvcr thought of alking himfelf how he was to 
drefs the flefh of this young lama, until the moment that 
he had killed it ? 

Harriet, Dear me ! could not he boil it or road it ? 
Mr. BilL That is what he would have done with all his 
heart, but unfortunately he had not a fingle article for the 
purpofe ; he had neither pot nor fpit, and, what is wdrfcj 
ne had not even fire. 

Harriet, No fire ? Why then all he had to do was X9 
light one. , 

Mr. Bill, True, if he had had a flint and fteel, tinder and 
matches ; but he had none of them. 
' Rich, I know what I would have done. 
Mr; BilL What, pray ? 

Rich, I would have rubbed two bits of dry wood one 
againft the other, until they took fixe, I recoiled that is 
the method ufed by fome favage people. We read it in a 
oolle^on of voyages.' 

Afr. Bill, Robinfon had exaftly the fame idea. He took 
\sp th^ lama, therefore^ upon his fhonlders, and turned his 
fteps homewards. ^ 

On the way, he made another difcovery, which afforded 
him infinite joy. This was a number of lemon-trees, feven 
o^ eight, round which, on the ground, he found feveral ripe 
oxies that liad fallen. He leathered them up carefully, 
marked the fpot where thefe trees grew, and, quite happy 
and content with his acquifition, ha^ened home to his ha- 
bitation. 

' There his fir ft bufinefs was to fkin the young lama. He 
effeded this by means of a fharp flint, which ferved him 
for a knife. He ftretched the (kin in the fijn as well as he 
cdiild in order to dry it, becaufe he forefaw that it might be 
of^fcrvice to him. 

Rich,. Why, what could he make of that ? 

Mr. Bill: Oh ! a great many things. In thp firft placei 

his fhoes and ftockings began already to be full of holes. 

He thought that, when his flioes were cyiite gone, he might 

make bits of this ikin, and failen them under his feet, io 



58 T H E K E vr 

as not to be obliged to walk ^aite barefoot. Befidea, Urn 
thoughts of winter troubled him not a little» and he wai 
glad that he had found a way to fumifti himfeU* with fur a« 
gainft the feverity of the cold. 

It is true, he might have fpared himielf thit.oneafiiieC ; 
for, in the coontry where he now was^ there was never any 
winter. 

Geo* Never any winter ? 

Mr. BUI, The cold of winter is feldom felt in any of 
thofe hot climates between the two tropics. I was fpeaking 
to you about them lately ; have you ibrgot how they are 
called? 

Htnry. The Torrid Zone. 

Mr, Bill, Right. — However, to make amends for tlu» 
want of winter, they have, during two or three monthi of 
the year, inceAant rains. As to Robinibn, he knew nothing 
of all that, becaufe, in his youth, he would not fuffer hia- 
felf to be properl)r inflru6led. Hifiory, geography, and 
every other improving fcience, were tirefpme and hateful to 
him. 

Rich, But, papa, I think, for all that, that we have read 
once how very high mountains^ like the Peak of Teneriff, 
are always covered with fnow ; and how, on that ridee of 
mountains which bounds Chili on the Eafi, and extends from 
Peru to the Straits of Magellan, fnow is to be feen die 
whde year. It mull certainly be always winter there ; and 
yet thefe places are between the tropics. 

. Mr, Bill. You are right, my dear Richard. Situadont 
very high and mountainous are an exception ; for upon the 
tops of thefe high mountains there is commonly a perpetual 
fnow. Do you remecnber too what I told you of (bmo 
countries in the Ball Indies, when we lately went over them 
OA the map? 

Rich, Yes ; that, in fome countries there, fummer and 
winter are but two or three leagues afunder. In the ifland 
of Ceylon, which belongs to tne Dutch ; and there alio— 
where — ^where was it ? 

Mr. Bill. In the peninfula on this fide of the Ganget : 
/or, when, on one nde of the Gaut mountains, it is winter, 
namely, upon the Coail of Malabar, on the other fide of 
thofe mountains, that is, upon the Coail of Coromandel, it 
is fummer, and fo. alternately. The fame is the caie al/b 
ia the Ifland of Ceram, one of- the Moluccas, where a man 

.needs 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

seeds 9b1j to travel three leagues to get but of winter int« 
iommerf or oat of fummer into winter. 

Bat here have we travelled very far from our friend 
Robinfim. Obferve how, at one fpring^ oar thoughts can 
tranfport themfelves in the twinkling of an eye to places 
diilant from us by many tlioufands of leagues. From Ame- 
rica we have taken a flight to Alia, and now— take care— 
hey paTs ! we are back again in America, at Robinfon Cru* 
foe's iiland. Is not this wonderful ? 

After he had (kinned the lama, taken out its bowels, and 
tut off a hind quarter to roafl, his firft care was to provide 
a fpit. For this he cut down a young flender willow-tree, 
peeled off the rind, and made it (harp at one end ; after 
winch he chofe a couple of forked branches to hold up the 
(pit. Having cut them of an equal length, and fharp at 
the ends, he ftuck them into the ground, oppofite to each 
other ; put the joint on the Qnt, which he then laid on the 
two forked fHcks ; and great indeed was his joy when he 
iaw how well his fpit went round. 

He wanted nothing now but, what is moA neceffary of 
all^ fire. In order to produce it by rubbing, he cut two 
pseces of wocfd from a dry trunk, and immediately fell to 
work. He rubbed fo briikly, that the fweat ran down his 
fice in great drop^ ; but he could not accomplifh his pur- 
pole : for when the wood was heated until it fmoked, jufi 
then he found himfelf fo fatigued, that he was under an ab- 
ftkite neceffity to flop a few moments and recover fbength ; 
ih the mean time, the wood cooled a little, and his whole 
laboor became ufelefs. 

Here again he had a lively inHance of the helpleflbefs of 
man in a flate of folitude, and what mighty advantages the 
iodety of other men affords ns. 

He wanted but another man to go on rubbing when he 
was tired, and then he certainly would have fet the piece 
of wood on fire ; but thofe interruptions, which he could 
not avoid, rendered the thing impoffible. 

RicJ^. And yet I always thought that the favages pro- 
duced fire by rubbing. 

Mr, Bill. So they do. But then thefe favages are ge- 
nerally much ftronger than we Europeans, u ho are brought 
up a peat deal too. delicately. In the next -place, they 
loiow better how to fet about it. They take two pieces of 
' different wood, one foft, the other hard, and they rub the 



6o THE MEW 

latter with a great deal of rapidity againft the former, 
whichy at length, ta|ces fire. Or elfe, again, they m^ke a 
hole in one of the bits of wood, into which they put the 
end of the othjir, and then turn it between their hands, with 
fo quick and mceiTant 4 motion, that at length it ^begins to 
burn. 

Of all this Robinfon knew not one tittle, and therefore 
did not fucceed. ' . 

At laft he threw away the pieces of wood, fat down upon 
his bed of hay in a melancholy mood, fupporting his. head 
upon his hand, and, fighing heavily, caft a look now and 
then upon the fine joint of meat, which was likely now to 
remain on the /pit without roafting Then fuddenly re- 
fle£ling what would become of him in winter if he 
Jiad no fire, he felt fuch piercing anxiety at the thought, 
that he was obliged to rife precipitately and walk about> in 
order to breathe more at his eafe. 

As his Ipirits were a good deal agitated, he grew thirfty, 
and went to the fpring with a cocoa-nut fhell to fetch fome 
water. With this he mixed tha juice of a lemon, which 
made a moik excellent drink, and afforded him unfpeakable 
refrefhmeut in a moment when he flood extremely in need 
of it. ^ . 

In the mean time, the fight of his meat upon the fpit 
made his mouth water ; he ardently longed for a little ilice 
of it. He recoUefted at length to have heard that the Tar- 
tars put the meat which they mean to eat under their horfes 
faddles, and fo bake it, as it were, at full gallop. This, faid 
he to himfelf, might be done as well by another method, 
and he refolved to try. 

No fooner faid than done. He went to feek two pieces of 
ftone, pretty broad and fmooth, of the fame fort as that of 
which his hatchet was made. Between tHefs-two flones he 
placed a piece of meat that had no bones, and began im- 
mediately to flrike without intermiflion upon the uppermoft 
ftone with his Hone mallet. After he had done this for five 
or fix minutes, the ft®ne began to grow hot, which made 
him continue to Ibike with redoubled adlivity ; fo that in 
lefs than half an hour, the meat, partly by the heat of the 
ftone, and partly by the preflTure and weight of the blows, 
was grown quita tender and fit to eat. 

No doubt the tafle of it was not altogether fo good as if 
it had been properly roaHcd : but to Robinfon, v(ho . had 

been 



B 



ftOBIMSON CRUSOE. 6l 

been Co long a time ivithout tailing meat» it was a delicious 
morfcl. " O you," he cried, ** O you amongrt my coun- 
trymen, whofe delicate ftomachs are often qu^miih at the 
light of the beft food in the world, if it does not exadly 
*fuit the depraved fenfuality of your appetites, if you 
were only a week in my place, how contented would you 
be all the reft of your lives with whatever food Providence 
ihonld fend you ! How careful would you be of deipifmg 
good viduals, and of (hewing your ingratitude to the ali- 
nourifhing bounty of Heaven !" 

In ord^r to make this meat more favoury, he fqueezed a 
little lemon juice upon it, and then he made fuch a meal as 
he had not made for n. long time. Neither did he forget 
to thank, from the bottom of his heart, the Author of all 
Goodnefs for this new benefit. 

When he had made an end of eating, he debated in his 
own mind what work would be the moft neceflary to fet 
about. The dread tf winter, which had but a little before 
affeded him fo ftrongly, made him think of taking or kill- 
ing a great number of lamas, merely to provide himlelf 
with ikms ; and, as thefe animals feemed to be extremely 
tame, he hoped to accomplifh this intent without much 
trouble. 

, With this hope he went to bed, and a found refrefliing 
(Ipep repaid him richly for all his fatigues during the day. 



SIXTH EVENING. 

IL4R. BILLINGS LEY continued the ftory of Rgblnfon 
^ Crufoe in thefe words : 

Our friend Robinfon flept till it was pretty far in the 
day. He was frightened, when he awoke, to find it fo late, 
and, riiing brilkly, he was going diredtly to take the field 
againft the lamas ; iut the heavens did not permit him. 

For no fooner did he put his head out of the cave, than 
he was obliged to draw it in again. 

Harriet. How was that^ papa!. 



62» .THE NEW 

3fr* BilL It rained as hard as it could |x>iir^ (b tkat ther^ 
was no poffibility of going out. He refolved* thecefbre, 
to wait until the Ihower was over. 

But there appeared no likelihood x>f this ; on the>cont];aiy, 
it grew more and more violent. It was accompanied alio 
with lightning fo bright, that his cave, which commonly 
was pretty dark, feemed to be all in a blaze ; and then the 
flafhes were followed by fuch claps of thunder as he had 
never heard. The earth trembled under the ftorm, and the 
echoes of the mountains repeated the found of the thunder 
fo often, that the tremendous roar feemed to be without 
end. 

^s Robinfon had not receive4 a good education^ is wat 
natural enough for him to be fcoliihly afraid of the ftorm* 

Ceo, What, afraid of thunder and lightning ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, fo frightened, that he did notknow where 
to hide himfelf. 

Geo, Why, it is fomething grand ; how could it frighten 
him ? 

Mr. Bill, I cannot well aflign a reafon for this fear. Per- 
haps it is, that the colleftion of fulphur, fait, and nitre, 
which produces the explofion of thunder, by taking fire, 
does, fometimes, in its courfe, fet buijdings on fire, andde- 
llioy the lives of thofe who are expofcd to it. 

Rich. Y es ; but thefe accidents are very rare, 

Mr. Bill. Befides, how many advantages does the ftorm 
bring with it ! It purges the air of fulphureous vapours; 
it renders the air much purer and fitter to promote the ve- 

fetation of plants ; the burninc; heat of the weather it ren- 
ers cool and terapersite ; and, laft of all, it prefents ut 
uith the grandeft and moft a'^ ful fpedlacle in nature. 

Harriet , I love to fee the lightning dearly. Papa, will 
you let us go. out with you when it thunders, that we may 
obferve the courfe of the lightning ? 

J^Ir. Bill. With all my heart. — Robinfon, as you remem- 
ber, had been ill-inftruded in his youth. This was the 
reafon why he knew not how great an advantage ftorms are; 
how they clear the air, and make every thing grow better 
in t<ie fields and gardens j and how, confequently, they 
contribute to rcfrefh and give, as it were, new life to both 
men and animals, trees and plants. 

During the fiorm, he fat in a. corner of his cave, with 
his hinds clafped together, and opprciTed with moft dreadful 

aiudety. 



ROBrirsoN cRusoB. 63 

Siuaety. The rain, mean while, ran down in fbeams, the 
lightnings flaftied, and the thunder roared inceflantly. It 
was almoil noon-day,, and the violence of the ftorro had not, 
m the leaft, abated, 

JRobinfon was not hungry ; his terror had entirely taken 
away his appetite ; but his imagination was difquieted with 
die moft frightful ideas. 

•' The time is come," faid he to himfelf, " when God 
will make me fufFer the punifhment due to my tranfgref-

■ Mr. Mer$J, Had not his merciful Creator done enough 
already in his favour, ta convince him that he never for- 
fijces thofc who trull in Mm finceiel)-, and whofc contrition 
lis undiiTembled ? Had he not faved him from the moil 
nnminent peril of death ? Had he not already aflided him in 
ftich a manner, that he had ample reafon never to fear pc- 
lilhing with hunger ? — And yet to be fo defponding ! i y, 
fy ! It has not a good afpe^. 

Mrs. Bill, I am of your opinion, Mr. Meredith ; never- 
thelefs, let us have compafllon on the poor youth. It was 
but very lately that he had begun to think at all, and, con- 
fequently, it was impofiible for him to have made fo great a 
mogrefs as one who had fludied from his earlieft years to 
become always wifer and better. 

Mr. BilL My dear, you are right. Your companion for 
poor Robinfon is as jufl as it is worthy of your tender na^ 
tiire« I myfelf begin to have a confiderable regard for kim^ 
as he has been fome time pafl in the right way. 

While he fat thus defponding, ovenvnelmed with trouUs 
^nd difquiet, die ftorm> at length, began to* abate. Aa 
the claps of thunder became leis loud, and the. rain came 
down lighter, hdpe by degrees revived in his breaft. He 
thought he fhould now be able to fet out on his expedition 
ft|;ainft the laxnas, and was going to take his hatchet and 
lus bag, when, all at once — ^what do you think?— he fell 
backwards, quite flunned and fenfelefs. 

Rich, Hey- day ! What was the matter wit'i him, then ? 

Mr* Bill, Exa6lly over his head there hval the terribleft

noife imaginable : the earth trembled, and ^binfbHwas 
thrown backwards^ and fell like a dead man. It feems the 
lightning had ftruck again ft the tree which grew on the top 
of the cave, and fhattered it all to pieces, with a found io 
tremendous as deprived poor Robinfon of his fenfes, ^nd he 
adlually thought he was killed. 

He remained on the ground a confiderable time before he 
recovered his fenfes. At length, perceiving that he was ftill 
alive, he rofe up, and the firft objed that he beheld before 
the door of his cave was part of the tree ivhich the lightniikg 
had torn in pieces, and thrown down. A frefh misfortune 
ibr Robinfon ! How was he now to faften his ladder of 
ropes, if the whole tree was broken down, as he thought it 
was? 

As the rain had now totally ceafed, and the thunder wat 
nb longer heard, he took courage, at laft, to go out ; and 
then what did he fee ? 

That which, in a moment, filled him with gratitude and 
Jove towards his Creator, and covered him with confufion 
for fuiFering himfelf to fall into defpondency, as he had 
do(ie. You muft know, the trunk of the tree which had 
been Uruck by the lightning was all on fire. Thus Robin- 
fon found himfelf, in a moment, matter of that which he 
had moft wanted ; and thus Divine Providence had taken 
the moft particular care of him, exadly at the moment when 
he imagined, in his defpair, that he was entirely abandoned* 
full of inexpieinble feelings of joy and gratitude, he lifted 
up his hands towards Heaven, and, (hedding a flood of 
tears, he thanked, with a loud voice, the afFedionate Father 
of the Univerfe, who governs all, and who, even when h« 
permits the moft terrifying events to take place, adb ever 
by the wifeft and moft charitable reafons. ** Oh I'^-faid 
lie, ** what, then, is man, this poor worm of the earthy 
whofe views are fo confined ? What is he, to dare to funr- 
mur againft that which God hath brought to pafs by mean^ 
infcruuble to all mankind ?'* 

From that time he had fire, without having had the leaft 
trouble in lighting it ; from thnt time it was eafy for him 
to keep the fire in ; and from that time he had reafon to be 
Icfs uneafy about his fubfiftence in this defert ifland. The 
defign that" tie had upon the lamas was dropped for to-day, 
becaufe Robinfon was defiurous to make ufe of the fire iin« 
mediately and roaft his meat, which had been upon the (pit 
^ver iince yeftcrday, 
>^' Aft 



leaBiNSON citusroE. 6$ 

Af^the fire had not yet reached the lower part of the tree, 
to which his ladder of ropes was faftened, he could mount 
in perfed fecurity. He did fo, took a burning fplinter of 
the tree,; defcended' again into the enclofure before his cave,- 
kindled a good fire under his meat, and then climbed up- 
once more to put oat that which was ftill burning in tht- 
trunk of the tree. This he effefled in a Ihort time. 

And now he fet about performing the duty bf a cook. 
He tended- tAe fire and turned the fpit very carefully. The 
fight of the fire rejoiced him infinitely ; he looked upon it as 
a precious gift whicb God had fent him from the clouds, 
smd while he receded on the great advantages that h# 
fhould enjoy from the pofTeffion of it, his eyes were often 
turned with gratitude towards Heaven. And during the 
jsefl of his life,, as often as he faw or thought of fire, he ne- 
¥er failed to fay within himfelf, ^*'Thnt aljo Go J gave nie.^ 

Mr. Mtred. Fire, which preferves all that breathe on this 
earth, is an emblem of the Divinity ;. it is the nobleil of all- 
elements. 

Mr. Bilk Hence it Is that the worfhip of fire hath beea 
very common amongll the ignorant pagans. At Rome it 
was preferved in the temple of Vefla ; at Athens, in that 
©f Minerva; at Delphi, in that of Apollo ; and, you moft 
remember how much it was reverenced in Perfia. 

Mr. Mend* Yes, but thank Heaven we are better in- 
ftrufted, and know that fire is not God, but a gift of God't 
bounty, like water, earth, and air, which he hath created 
from the love he bears us.. 

Mr. Bill, Robinfon, during his repafl the day before^ 
had only regretted the want of fait, which would have im- 
proved the tad e of the meat that he dreffed by blows of the 
jpaallct. He hoped, however, in time, to find fome fait jit 
jlis ifland ; fer the prefent he contented himfelf with going 
to the fhore, and brmging home, in a cocoa-nut-fhell, fome 
iea water, with which he fprinkled his meat fcvcral times, 
falting it in this manner, in default of a better. 

His meat was now done. The joy with which he eut 
i)ff the firft flice, and put the firft bit into his mouth, cannot 
be" defcribed, but by one, who, like him, fhould not have 
tafled for a month before a fingle mouthful of meat pro- 
perly dreft, and who fhould have almofl given up the hopei 
©f ever tafting any fuch again.

After this, the main point was how to keep in his fire 
always. 

Gte, That he could eaiily manage by adding conftantly 
freih wood. 

Mr. Bill, Very good. But at night, while he wa« 
afleep, if there ctme a fudden fhower, what was he to do 
then ? 

Harriet, But, papa, I'll tell you what: I would have 
made the fire in my cave « here the rain could not come. 
' Mr. Bill No bad thought. J8ut, unfortunately, his cave 
was fo fmall, that it juft ferved him to lie down in : and, 
then, chimney he had none *y fo that the fmoke would have 
1>een exceedingly inconvenient to him ; he could not have 
borne it. 

Harriet. Nay, in that cafe I do not know how to affift 
.him. 

Rich. What a terrible fituation ! There muft always 
'happen fomething to puzzle poor Robinfon. One would 
think, now* and then, that he was made completely happy ; 
but, your humble fervant, fomething new comes all at once 
to crofs him. 

Mr. Bill. This may ihew you how extremely difficult it 
is for one man fmgly to provide for all his ow n neceffitie^ 
and how great the advantages are that we enjoy from civil 
life. My dear children, we fhould be but poor miferablc 
beings, if we were obliged each of us to live by himfelf, 
find if nobody were to receive any affiftance from his fellow- 
creatures. A thoufand hands are not fufficient to prepare 
what each of us wants every day. 

Rich. Oh ! papa I— 

Mr. Bill. What, do you think that incredible? Well, 
let us' reckon how many things you have had occaflon for 
this day. In the firfl place, you have ilept till fun-nfe thie 
morning, and that on a good bed. 
K Rich. With a mattrefs underneath. 

Mr. Bill. Very well. Mattreffcs are fluffed with horfe« 
hair : this horfe-hair requires two hands to cut it, two more 
to weigh and fell it, two to pack it up and fend it off", two 
to receive it and unpack it, and two, again, to fell it to 
the faddler or upholftercr : laftly, the upholfterer's hands 
find employment in picking it and filling the mattrefs with 
it. The cover of this mattrefs is ticking j where has that

firft place,* the hufl>andman fifts the Hax ieed, that it may 
not be mixed with tares : then the land muft be dunged and 
ploughed twice ; after which they fow, and then harrow. 
Next, when the flax begins to fprout up, a number of wo- 
5ien aud^irb come to weed it. Again, when it grows to 
a proper height, they pluck up the ftalks, and ripple tliem 
in order to pull off" die little round heads that contain the

dies, and fteep them in water. 

Hgnry, And when the bundles have been fteeped long 
enough* they take them up out of the water. 

Geo, And fpread them in the fun to dry. 

Charhtte. Ihen they clear the flax from the hulls with a 
hnak. 

Harriet. Not yet, my dear Charlotte \ it muft be well 
pounded firft. 

Cbariotte.^ Very true,, and then they break it, and then—

have been employed in the making of your mattreis. ^ 

Ge0. Athbtima hands I It is wonderful, and yet it is very 
fnic. 

Mr. BiUf In the next place, cpnfider how many things 
yon have daily occafion fox, and thim pray tell me> fhonld it 
furprife us that Bjpbbifon Crufo^ found himfelf every now 
and then puzzled an4' at a ftand« when not another hknd ia 
die world but his own' worked fp? him, and when he had not 
a fingle one of tho(e in^nieiits 1^ means of which things in 
this part pf the ^orU are fp ea£ly and expeditioufly ma(&. 

At this time, tb/i^Bfi)re« what puzzled him was the finding 
of forae method Of ether tp hind^ his dear fire from gding 
cut. Sometimes hp fcratched Ids head as if he would have 
phicked a lucky thought out of it; agsdn, letting his hands 
fall, he v^ould wrikjbackwards and forwards in his enclofure, 
not knowing w£at to have recourfe to. At laft he fixed his 
eyes by diancjk on die rock at the edge of his cave, and that 
moment the ^ipught fb-uck him how ne was to adi. 

Hiftry, Eh, I how was that? 
, Mr. Billi There projected out of the rock, about a yard 
ifromthe|^rDund>a very large and thick ledge of flone. 

Cbarktft: How large might it be ? 

Mr. BHU Why really I Imve not been able to procure the 
fjcaft prpportions of it ; but I will fuppofe, at a euefs, that it 
was about as long as I am, its breadth and thi^nefs might 
be a yard and a half. 

Though it had rained very hard, the ground, under this 
}arge piece of the rock was perfedly dry. Robinfon faw at 
once that this fpot would anfwer every purpofe of a fire- 
place^ being completely fheltered from all accidents ; but he 
law, moreover, that it would require no great trouble ta 
make a proper kitchen under the ftone, together with hearth 
and chimney, and therefore refolved to go immediately to 
work about it. 

With his fpade he hollowed the ground under the great 
fione about a yard deep. After that, he conceived the idea 
of enclofing this ground, at the fide> with two iinall walls 
jreaching up t9^e flone itfelf. 

Geo. B^how could he make walls? 

Mr.Bilh He had been accuflomed, you know, minutely

lumfelf thequcftion, " What ufe may be made of this?"— 
He had,^amongft other things, obferved a particular fort of 
€layinone part of his ifland, upon iight of which he imme-*^ 
diately faid to himfelf, " Perhaps this clay would make goo4 
bricks, if ever I fhould have occafion to build a walL" 

At that moment he recolledled the clay, and, having near* 
ly finiihed hollowing out his kitchen, he took his fpade and 
his knife of flint, and repaired to the fpot where this clay wu 
to b'e found, in order to fet about die work without delay. 

The heavy rain had made the clay fo foft, that he found no 
difficulty in fhaping it to the, form of bricks, and cutting it 
linooth with his knife. After preparing a pretty good num- 
ber of thefe bricks, in a ihorttime, he placed them,, befide 
each other, in a fpot where the fun Aione all day. He 
determined to go on with this work the next day, and in the 
inean time returned home to eat the refl of his roail meat, the 
cagernefs with which he had worked having fharpened his 
appetite. That he .might regale himfelf in a princely man- 
3tter on fiich a day of rejoicing as the prefent, he indulged 
bimfelf by adding to his fupper a cocoa-nut from the fmall 
xwmber of thofe that (till remained. 

The repall was excellent. ** Ah!"^ faid Robinfon, figh- . 
ing from the bottom of his heart, which was partly content 
- and partly forrowful> *' Ah! how happy fhould I be at this^ 
moment, if I had but one fmgle friend, merely a man, were 
it the moil miferable beggar in the world, to bear me com* 
pany ; one iingle nfan, whom I might call my friend,, while 
I profefled to him an equal friendftiip I Had I, at leaft, the 
happinefs of being mailer of fome tame animal, a dog or a 
cat, to whom I might ihewkindnefs in order to gain its aflec- 
jden ! But to live thus folitary, abfolutely cut off from every 
living creature, and as if I were the only being upon the 
earth !"■ Here a few tears dropped down his cheeks. 

He then recalled to memory the time ^ when, having it in 
hb power to enjoy the fweet lociety of his brothers and other 
companions, he neverthelefs had frequently quarrelled and 
difputed with them : the recolledlion of this filled him with 
bitter forrow. *' Ah 1" faid he to himfelf,. " how little I 
then knew the value of a friend, and the impoffibility of do- 
ing without the love and eileem of our neighbours, if we would 
live happy I Oh, if I could now begin to pafs- thofe days over 
again, with what complaifance and good-nature would I 
tdiaye towards my. brothers and other children ! How pa-

tiently w«iild I pat up with fmalt offences j and how wmild t 
exert mvfelf to chann every body with my gentlenefs and 
good benavioar» and force diem to love me in their torn !— 
Heavens! why did I not know how to value the happinefs 
of friendfhip until I had loft that happin^fs-^alas ! loft it for 
tiver?** 

With thefe words he turned his eyes accidentally towards 
the entrance of his little lodge, and perceired a fpider which 
had fpread its web in a corner. The thpught of lying under 
the fame roof with fome living creature fo filled him with 
joy, that he did not trouble himfelf in the leaft about the 
fpecies of tfie animal. He refoWed to catch flics every day 
tor this fpider, to (hew it that it lived in a place of freedom 
Md frtendiliip, and in order to make it tame, if it was polBble. 

As it wa« ftill day, and the air, freftiened by the ftorro, 
was infinitely agreeable to the feofe, Robinfon did not chu(e 
CO go to bed yet, and that he might employ the time in 
fomewhat ufeful, he took up his fpade again, and began to 
hollow out the ground for his kitchen. In doing this, he 
flruck all at orce upon fomething hard that was in the 
earth, and was very near breaking his fpade. 

He took it at firft for a ftone ; but what was his aftonifh- 
ment, when, having drawn out a great heavy lump of fome- 
thing, he difcovered it to be— pure gold ! 

RicJIf* Gracious! Well, he certainly has furpriling luck, 
this Mr. Robinfon Crufoe. 

Mr, Bill, Surprifing luck indeed! This mafs of gold was 
Co thick, thaC, had it been coined^ it would have produced 
upwards of io,oool. Behold himi therefore, at prefent, a 
man of vaft fortune! What a number of things could he 
procure himfelf now !' He could build himfelf a fine houfe ; 
he could have a carriage, horfes, footmeni apes, monkies ; 
he could ' 

Gea, Ay ; but where was he to have all thefe things in 
his ifland ? There was nobody there that had any thing to 
fell. 

Mr, BilL Oho ! I had forgot.— Robinfon, however, did 
net ; fo thar, inftead of rejoicing for the treafure that he 
had found, he kicked it from him with contempt, aud fa'd, 
'* Lie there, miferable metal, which men in general covet fo 
greedily, ai)d which ihey purchafe with fo many bafea6^ions 
and even crimes ! . Of what ufe art thou to mt ? Oh 1 that, 
in thy place, 1 had found a good lump of iron, nitb which

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7f 

I might, perhaps, have made myfelf a hatchet or a knife !— 
How williogly would I give thee for a handful of iron nails, 
or for feme ufcful inftruroent !"— He left, therefore, all this 
prectous trcafure lying ncglc£ted on rjie ground, and after- 
wards, as he palfed by, fcarce thought it worth a look, 

Harriet. I'll tell you what, papa. He did cxadly as the 
cock did. 

Mr. Bill. What cock ? 

Harriet. Oh 1 do you forget the fable that you read to Oi 
one day ? Once upon a time there was a cock 

Mr. Bill. What next? 

Uarriet. That fcratched upon a dunghill, and found a— 
what was it ? 

Mr. Bill A pearl? 

Harriet. Ah ! yes ; a pearl — And then he faid, " Of 
what ufe art thou to me with ail thy brightuefs ? if I ha4 
found, infiead of thee, a grain of barley, it would have 
beca of much more fervice to me." S.iying this, he left 
the pearl on the ground, and went away wlihouc taking any 
farther notice of it, 

Mr. Bill, Very good. Jufl. fo did Robin Ton with the 
lump of gold. 

Night now came on. The fun had for fome time funk 
beneath the main — 
■- Geo. What, in the fea? 

Mr. Bill. So it appears to ihofe who live in an ifland, and 
fee nothing round them but water. The fun, in fad, feems 
to them to link down in o the fea at night when he fets ; anJ, 
therefore, people fometimes exprefs themfelves thus, as if 
the thing were really fo. " 

The moon rofe bright at the other end of the heavens, and 
Ihone fo beaiitifuUy into Robinfun*s cave, that the delight- 
fulnefs of the view hindered him from going to deep. 

Harriet. Oh ! look, look, dear papa ; our moon too begins 
to appear yonder. 

Rich. Oh ! what an enchanting fight ! how mild her light 
is! how pleafitig! 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dears, Robinfon is afleep, while his 
fire, kept up bv large pieces of wood, continues to burn 
(lowly. Now, what do you think of doing in the mean time ?

SEVEKTH EVENING, 



^ 'pHE following eTening, before Mr. Elllingflcy began the 
caminuatioD of Robiafon Cru&e's hiftory» he expreffed 
lumfelf thus : I hope> my dear children^ that, in relating 
this hiftory to you, 1 do not detaia you from any employ- 
ment more agreeable or improving. I would not put the 
lead conClraint on you; fo that whenever dur friend Ro« 
binfon grows tirefome to you 

Eiko. Ttrefome, papa? It is impoflible. 

Mr, BslL However, I obferved feme of you, ycfterday 
evening, gape and yawn a good deaU 

Geo. Oh! papa, the reafon of that wa», that we had worked 
very hard in our gardens all the afternoon,^ fo that it was no 
woader if we were a little fleepy towards /light.. 

Edw. To»-day we have only been weeding ^nd watering 
our lettuce beds, fo that we are quite fre(h. 

Harritt^ Oh ! quite frefh, papa ; look how I can jump^ 

Mr. Bill, Well j you have only to tell me whenever thi» 
ilory begins to grow heavy or dull. 

Rich. Oh ! never fear;^ I'll warrant you. 

Afr. Bill. Then I proceed.. 

As the heat was excedive in Robinfon^s ifland during the 
day.time, he was obliged, whenever he undertook any thing 
laborious, to work at it very early in the morning, or elfe 
in the cool of the evening. He rofe, therefore, before the 
f UD, put frclh wood to his fire, and ate the half of a- cocoa.. 
BUt that he had left iince the evening before.. After this 
lie intended to have put another joint of his lama oa the fpit;: 
but he found the fU(h already tainted, on account of the ex« 
traordinary hear. He was, therefore, obliged to go with* 
out the pleafure of eating meat for that day. ^ 
|i» Upon this, he prepared to fet out for the clay-pit ; andj^ 
putting on his pouch, he found ftili remaining in it the po» 
tatoea which he had brought home two days before. He 
refolvcd to try the experiment of dreffing them; fo put them 
down clofe by his fire,, aad, ha^vbg^ covered them with hot 
aihes, he fet out» 

^ Be

He worked fo hard, that before twelve o'clock he had pre. 
pared as many bricks as he thought he (hould have dcca.(ion 
for, to complete the wall of his kitchen. He next went 
down to the beach to look for Tome oy{ler»; bu^y inftead of 
o)ftcr8, of which he t'oond only very few, he difcorcred, to 
hts great joy, another fort of food, much better than any 
that he had found yet. 

Rich. What was that, papa ? 

Mr, Bill. It was an animal, the flefh of which, it is true* 
he had never taded; but he had frequently heard that it was 
the mod wholefome and delicious imaginable. 

Rich. Well, then, what was it ? 

Afr. Bill A tanle, and fo large, that it is rare to fee the 
like in thofe parts. It might weigh 100 lb. 

Gtff. Why, it muft have been a monfier of a turtle. Are 
there really fuch great ones ? - 

Ritb. Oh ! yes ; and much larger fiill. Have you fbrgot 
what papa read from Captain Cook's Voyages. The turtle 
that his people found in the South Seas weighed 3ooib. 

Geo. 300 lb. — adoniiking! 

Jl!&. Bill. Robinfon loaded his (boulders with his prize, 
and marched ilowly homewards.-— When he arrived at his 
cell> his firficare was to come at the flefh of the turtle, which 
he did, ac length, by cutting open, with his hatchet, the 
lower Hieli that covered its belly ; he then killed ir, and 
cut off a good part of it to roaft, which, having fixed upon 
the fpit, he waited with impatience until it was done, for 
his work had confiderably iharpened his appetite. 

While he turned the fpit, he conlidered with himfelf what 
he muft do with the reft of the turtle, to keep it from taint* 
iog. .To fait it would have been the only effe<^ual way, but 
then he had neither tub nor fait. 

It filled him with concern to think that all that fine turtle, 
the flefli of which would nouriih him for more than a week^ 
muft be unfit to eat the next day; and yet he could not think 
of any expedient to fave it. All at once a thought ftruck 
him. The upper (hell of the turtle was fhaped like a large 
bowl. " That,** faid he, ** ftiall fei ve me for a trough to 
fait it in — but where is. the fait ? 

" Only think, what a great fool I mufl be!" cried he, 
ftrikinghis handagainft his head; *' cannot I fteep this meat' 
in fea-water, and will not that have the fame effeiSt, or nearly 
foy that brine wouU have } A lucky thought ! a lucky

thought V^ cried he ; and his joy made him turn rtc fptt 
twice as faft as before. 

His turilvi was now nicely done. ** Ah !" faid RubinfonV 
Cghing^ after he had taded, with much fatis faction, afmall 
bit o£ it which he thought very favoury, ** if one had the 
lead morfel of bread with this! How flupid was I, in my 
youth, not to know that we (hould thank God for a bit of dry 
bread! I was fcldom contented if my bread was not loaded 
with butter, and even then,, perhaps, I muft have chcefe^ 
Oh idiot that I was f How happy (hould I now be with a 
piece of the blackeil rye brea^ that ever was ma^e in my 
country I*' > 

While he was taken up with' ihcrerefie£\ions, hcrecolle6i«- 
€d the potatoes that he had left in the aflies before he went 
out in the moroing. **Let us fee,** faid he, *' how they will 
turn out ;'* and he took up one of them. 

Here was new ca^fe of rejoicing ^ The fruit, which war 
before fo hard, was now become q^uite tender f and- when b^ 
opened it, the fmell was fo pleating, he never heGtatcd to* 
conclude that thetafte muil be equally fov In epe6l, thii 

root tailed as agreeable — as agreeable as £h! Who 

will help me out with a fimile ^ 

Mr. Mned. As agreeabie as a potatoe. 

Mr, Bill. Even fo. That fettles it all in one ' 
fhorr, Robinfon perceived that this root, which waj 
able to the tafte, would fupply the place of bread. 

He made, therefore, a magnificent repad ; after which^ 
86 the fun was burning hot, he threw himfelf on the bed for 
a while, to conlider at his eafe what work he ibould begi^ 
when the violence of the heat was over. 

*^ What piece of work," faid he, ^ fhould I undertakcat 
prefent? The fun mufl: harden my bricks before I can be- 
gin my walL The bed way then, certainly, will be to go 
and kill a couple of lamas. — But what am I to do with fucb 
a quantity of meat .^~ What, if I (hould hang up fome of ir 
to dry in the fmoke of my kitchen ? — Excellent i'*^criedlic» 
and with thefe words he bounced from his bed, and fat 
down in the front of his intended kitchen, to deliberate oar 
th^ means of fucceeding in this plan» 

He prefently faw that the thing might be done well 
enough. He had only to leave two holes in the walls thac 
he was to build, and through them to run a lar&e ftick acrofs. 
It was ao eafy mauer to bang bis bams and flitches upon 

this,

this; and the fmoke of the chimney would do the reft. This 
happy thought was near turning his head with joy. What 
would 'he have given that his bricks were already hard 
enough, that he might begin the grand work that very 
moment ! But there was no help for it ; he mull be content 
to wait un* il the fun hardened his bricks. 

Something, however, muft be done to employ the time. 
While he meditated what that fliould be, a frefh thought 
ftruck him, which by far furpaffed, in cleverncfs, all that he 
had hitherto conceived : and he was aflonilhed at his folly in 
not having hit upon it before. 

Rich. What was it, then ? 

Mr. BilL No more than this ; he refolved, in order that 
he might have company, and at the fame time provide for 
his fubfiftence, to bring up fome tame animals. 

Geo, Ah! fome of the lamas, I dare fay. 

Mr, Bill. Right. In faft, thefe were the only animals 
that he had feen hitherto. As thefe lamas appeared already 
to be extremely tame, he hoped he ihould fucceed in taking 
a couple of them alive. 

Gi9. Oh» that would be delightful ! I ihould like to be 
along with him, to have another couple. 

Mr, BilL But pray, George, how would you contrive it? 
They were hardly fo tame as to let themfelves be caught. 

Gfo, Then how did Robinfon mean to do ? 

Mr, Bill, That was the very point 'that Robinfon had 
many long and ferious deliberations upon. But man, where 
an undertaking is not in itfelf abfolutely impoffible, man 
needs but to oviV/ferioufly and with perfeverance, and nothing 
is infonnountable to his underftanding and induflry ; fo great 
and manifold are the faculties with which our good Creator 
hath endowed us 1 

Attend to this, my dear children, and never dcfpair of 
faccefs in any labour or difficulty whatiocver, provided you 
take the firm refolution of not giving over until you have 
aooompliihed it. Unwearied application, conftant reflec- 
tion,' and a courage that perfeveres in fpite of every obftacle, 
have often brought enterprizes to a period which were at firft 
deemed impradicable. Never, therefore, fuffer yourfelves 
to bedi&ouraged by the difficulties which you will meet with 
in the aflfairr of life ; but always re fledl that the more exer- 
tion it has coft to bring a buiinefs to a happy ilTue,. the more 
joy one feeU at having accompliihedit. 



76 T H B K 1 vr 

Robmfbn foon fucceeded in hitting upon a wctfiod'to take 
the lamas alive. 

Ricif. What was it ? 

Mr. Bill. He propofed to make a noofe uponf a cord> and^ 
hiding himfelf behind a tree, to throw the nooTe over the 
head of the firfl lama that fhould approach. 

With this intent, he twilled a pretty Arong cord, and in t 
few hours the cord and the noofe were completed : he made a 
trial or two to fee whether the noofe would catclvwell^ and it 
anfwered perfeftly to his wi(h. 

As the place by which the lamas were accuffomed to pafiV 
in their way to the water, was pretty far off, and becai^e he 
was not fure whether they would pals by there that evening, 
as it was about noon that he faw them go lo drink before, he 
put off till next day the execution of his project ; in the mean 
lime he made the preparations requifite for the journey. 

That is to {ay,, he went to the (pot where the potatoes grewr 
and filled his l»g with them. Part of them he put down< in 
the warm afhes to roafl, and the refl he threw into a corner 
of his cave for a future (lore. In the next place, he cut off 
a pretty large piece of his turtle to fenve for fvpper dhd the 
next morning's breakfail> and fleeped what remamed in fea-^ 
water, which he bad brought with him for the purpofe; 

LafUy, he dug a fmall hole in the ground which was to be 
his cellar, for want of a better. In it he placed his turtle-- 
fhell with the falted meat, placed over that the piece* that he 
meant to roafl for (upper,, and then covered the whole witB 
fmall branches of trees. 

For the refl of the afternoon, in order tarefrelh his (pirits, 
he indulged himfelf with an agreeable walk along the fea*- 
fide, where there blew a fine frefh eafterly breeze, whiidt 
rendered the air agreeably cool. His eyes traverfed wirir 
pieafure the immenfe ocean, whofefurface was thengentlv 
agitated by fmall waves following each other in flow uiccel- 
fion to the fhore. He twned his eyes fondly towards the pare 
of the world where his dear country was fituated, and a few 
trembling tears trickled down \m cheeks at the remembrance 
of his beloved parents.. 

** What are they doing now» thofe poor difconfblafte p*» 
rents?" cried he, bathed in tears, and clafping his. hands 
together. «^* If thev have furvivcd the bitter forrow w hich I

me in order to m^ future amendment, could but my poor 
parents, who are innocent, be made happy !'* 

He remained a little longer on his knees, looking up toi 
Heaven in filent grief, and his tyts fwimming in tears. At 
length he rofe, and, with his knife of Hint, he cut out, upon 
the tender bark of a tree that was at hand, the much-loved 
Barnes; of his parents. Over them he placed thefe words, 
" Goid blefs you !" and below, *' Mercy to your loft fon I'* 
After that, his lips, warm with afteClicn, kiffed the names 
which he had cut out, and he bedewed them with his tears; 
He afterwards engraved thefe fame names, which were fo 
dear to him, upon a number of other trees in other parts of 
the ifland, and, from (hat time forward, he generally offered 
up his prayers at the foot of one of thefe trees, and never 
failed to remember his parents in them. 

Geo, For once, I think, he behaved well. 

Mr. Bill, He is, at prefent, in the faireft train to become 
an honefl and good man, and for this he is indebted to the 
wife Providence of Heaven which conduced him hither. 

Geo, He might now, therefore, return to his parents, if 
providence thought fit, 

iW^. BilL God, who forefees every thing that will happen, 
knows beft what h for the advantage of any man, and will 
regulate the events of his Hfe accordingly. It is true, dr- 
cumftances have kindled a fpark of virtue in Robinfon's 
bread, but who can tell if other drcumfbmces would not 
^quickly extinguifh this fpark again; and if he was at this 
moment taken from his ifland, and reflored to his father's 
houic, who knows whether the infe^ion of example and prof*

perity would not corrupt him once more ? Oh, my dut 
dren, how jufl is this precept, ** Let him that fiandeth takt 
heed left he fall I" 

While Robinfon walked backwards and forwards on the 
beach, it occurred to him that he would do well to bathe 
himfelf. He, therefore, took off his cloaths ; but how was 
he terrified on feeing the condition of his fhirt, the only one 
that he had ! As he had worn it without ihifting for fo long 
ft time, and in fo hot a climate, one could fcarcely perceive 
that the linen had ever been white. Wherefore, before he 
bathed himfelf, he took care to wafh this fhirt as well as pof* 
iible, and, having hung it upon a tree to dry, he jumped into 
the water. 

He had learned to fwim pretty early, fo that being j>erfc£l 
mailer of the exercife, he amufed himfelf with fwimming out 
to a good diftance from fhore towards a neck of land that ex- 
tended pretty far into the fea, and upon which he had never 
been yet. 

Charles *e. A neck of land ? What is that ? 
. Mr. Bill, We give that name to a long piece of land, one 
end of which joins an ifland or a continent, and the other 
ftretches out into the fea. You underftand ? 

Charlotte, Oh, perfedly. 

Mr. Bill, This thought of Robinfon's was very lucky ; 
for he found that the n^ck of land waj, during the time of 
high water, entirely covered, and that, on the ebbing x)f the 
tide, a confiderable quantity of turtles, oyfters, and mufcles» 
were left behind. This time, indeed, he could npt carry 
^ny of them away, neither did he want them at prefent, as 
his kitchen was fufficiently ftored : however, the difcovery of 
them afforded him no fmall degree of fatisfadUon. 

That part of the fea in which he fwam abounded with fifh 
fo plentifully that he cctild almoft have caught them with his 
hands. If he had had a net he might have taken them by 
thoufands : however, though he had none,^ he hoped, as he 
had been hitherto fo fortunate in all his undertakings, that 
lie might one day or other be mafler of a fifhing-net. 

Satisfied with thefe difcoveries, he came out of the water,. 
after having been a full hour in it. The heat of the fan had 
entirely dried his fhirt, and he had the pleafure once more of 
putting on clean linen. 

But, as he hadcontradled the habit of reHedting upon every 
diing, he confidered that this pleafure could not laft very 

loots

£IGHTH EVENING. 

jyT?. Bill. Well, where did we leave off laft night ? 

Henry. Where Robinfon went to bed after bathing. 

Mr* Bill. Oh ! right.— -WqII, then, Robinfon rofe the 
next morning early, and prepared for the chace. He fur- 
niihed his pouch with plenty of roafled potatoes, and a good 
large (lice of roafted turtle, which he wrapped np in the 
leaves of the cocoa-nut tree. Next he flung his hatchet by 
his iide, tied the cord, which he had made the dav before 
for catching the lamas, round his waifl, took his umDrellaia 
his hand, and began his march. 

It was very early ; he refolved, therefore, for this time, 
to take a round, in order to make him&lf acquainted witn 
feme other parts of his ifland. Amongft the numbers of va- 
rious birds that fluttered about the trees, he renurked ibme 
parrots, the colours of whofe plumage were extraordinary 
beautiful. How did he wiih to hive one of them^ that he 
might tame it, and have it for his companion ! But the old ones 
were too cunning to be caught, and he could no where dif- 
cover a nefl with young ones. He was obliged, therefore, 
to put off the gratification of this wiih until ibme other op- 
portunity. 

In return for this difappointment, he difcovered, an the 
courfe of his walk, a thing much mcM'e neceilary ta him than 
a parrot ; for, getting to the top of a hill near the iea-iide, 
and looking down between the cracks of the rock, he f»«V 
fomething lie on the ground which excited his curioiity. 
He let himfelf down by the affiftance of his feet and bands, 
and found, to his great fatisfadion, that it was — what do yoa 
think t 

Henry. Pearls, perhaps. 

Rich, Yes, truly, the fight of pearls would have giw 
him great fatisfadtion ! Perhaps it was iron. 

Edw. Nay, do not you know that iron is not to be found 
in hot climates ? It was, perhaps, another lump of gold. 

Harriet. Nonfenfe ! Would that have made him glad ? 
Gold was of no ufc te him, you heard before* 

Mr. 



HOBIKSON CRUSOE. Sj 

Mr, Bill. I fee you will not be able to guefs, then ; I 
will tell you. What he found was — fait. 

Hitherto he had, it is true, infome refpe6l> fuppliedthe 
want of fait with fea- water ;. but, after 2i\\,that was not fait. 
The fea-water has a bitter tafle which is very difagreeable ; 
and« befides, it was a miilake to think that meat falted in 
this manner would keep ; becaufe fea water, as well as that 
of a fpring or river, grows ilinking after it has ftood fome 
time. It was, therefore, a very lucky thing that he found 
fome real fait, and he filled both his pockets with it, in order 
to fupply himfelf with a flock for immediate ufe. 

Geo, How did that fait come there, papa ? 

Mr, Bill. Then you do not remember what I told you 
one day concerning the original of fait ? 

Rteb, Oh I yes ; I recoUed it ftill. Some they take Out 
of the earth, fome they make of fait- water that flows in, 
fprings, and fome, again, is made from fea-water. 

Mr. Bill. Now, the fait made from fea-water is eithef 
prepared by men or by the fun. 

Geo. The fun ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes ; for when any fea-water is left upon the 
iUnd, after a high tide, or a flood, the fun makes the water 
by degrees to evaporate, and what remains on the fpot is 
then (alt. 

Harriet, Well, that is comical. 
' Mr. Bill. See with what kindnefs Heaven prox'ides for us ! 
TTiat which we can leafl do without, does always require the 
leafl preparation by art, and is always found in the greatefi 
abundance. 

kdbinfon went in high fpirits to the place where he hopetf 
to noofe a lama. When he came there, he faw none ; but 
then it was not quite noon. He fat down, therefore, at the 
foot of a tree, to regale himfelf with his roaft turtle and pota- 
toes. How much more favoury did they tafle to him nov 
that he had a little fait to eat with them 1 

Tall as he had finifhed his meal, the lamas appeared at a 
diliance, coming towards hinj with fkips and bounds. Ro- 
binibn quickly placed himfelf in a poAure of attack, and wait- 
ed with his noofe ready for the apjproach of one of the lamas. 
Several had paifed him beyond his reach ; but, all at 
once, there came up one fo near to him, that he fcarce 
needed moxe than to drop the noofe to have Lim fafl 

& z in 



84 T H E N E W 

in it. He did fo, and that moment the lama was hispri- 
(pDet. 

The poor beaft would have bleated, but, left that ihould 
frighten the reft, Robinfon pulled the noofe fo tight, that 
the lama was completely filenced. He then dragged it as 
faft as he could into a thick coppice to hide it from the 
reft. 

This lama was a female, and had two young ones, which 
followed her, to the great fatisfadion of Robinfou, and did 
not appear to be the leaft afraid of him. He patted the 
pretty little things, and they— -juft as if they would have 
begged of him to let their mother go «— licked his hands* 
Geo. Well, then, 1 think he might have let her go. 
Mr. Bill. He would have been a great fool in doing 
fo- 

Geo. Nay> the poor creature had done him no harm 
however. 

Mr. Bill, But hfe had occadon for it ; and you know, 
my dear George, we are permitted to make ufe of animals 
in cafe of need^ provided we do not abufe them. 

Robinfon was tranfported with joy at having fo happily 
attained his obje6^. He dragged the creature along with 
all his ftrengtb, though (he jumped and ikippeda good deal 
to get from him, and the two little ones followed quietly 
behind. The (horteft way was now the beftfor Robinfon, 
and, purfuin^ that, he at length ariived happily at hit 
idwelling- place. 

But here darted a difficulty. How was he to get the 
lama into his enclofure, which, as we have faid before, was 
fo ftrongly barricaded all round? To fling it down from 
the top or the rock by means of a cord, was not at all ad- 
vifeable ; the poor animal might be ftrangled in the way, 
Robinfon refolved> therefore^ to make up a little liable near 
his place of abode, and there to keep the lama and her young 
ones, until he ihould be able to fuit hisconveniency better. 

In the mean time he fattened the animal to a tree, and 
immediately fell to work : that is to fay, he cut down with 
his hatchet of flint a number of young trees, and fived 
them in the ground, fo clofe one befide the other, that they 
formed a pretty ftrong wall. While this was doing, Ihe 
lama lay down through wearinefs, and the little ones, no 
way troubled at their being prifoners, were fucking quite 
vi}concerned, and feafting themfelves at their eafe.

times he ftopped from his worl^ to look at the pretty little 
creatures, ana thought himfelf beyond meaiure happy ia 
having (bme animated beings to bear him company* From 
\ this moment hit life feemed no longer folitary, aod the joy 
which he felt from this reflection, gave him fuch flrength 
and a6livity» that hit liable was very foon finilhed : he then 
put the lama and her young ones into it, and clofed up the 
iaft opening with branches firmly interwoven. 

What was his fatisfadion now ! It is impoffible for words 
to defcribe it. Beiides the company of the lamas, which of 
itfelf was a valuable thing, he promifed himfelf many other 
great advantages, and with much reafon : for in time he 
might perhaps learn to make fome fort of cloathing with the 
wool of thefe animals ; he might ufe their milk for food, 
he might make butter and cheefe of it. It is true, he did 
not yet know by what means he (hould attain thefe objedle, 
which were ftill fo far diftant ;. but he had already experi- 
enced that no man (hould dcfpair of his fkill or performance,, 
piovided he gives his whole mind to the work, and applies 
to it with perfcvering attention. 

There wanted (lill one thing to complete his happinefs: 
lie wifhed to be in the fame enclofure with bis dear lamasy 
that he might have them always before his eyes when he was 
at homeland enjoy the fatisfaCtion of feeing them grow fond 
of his company. 

He puzzled himfelf a long time to find how he (hould ac- 
compr)(h this : at length, his determination was to break down 
one fide of his wall of trees, not grudging whatever labour 
, it might coft him, and to make another wall that would take. 
in a larger fpace. This alteration, befides, would give him 
more room, and make him more at his eafe. But in order 
to he fecure from all accidents while he was workiug at bis 
Dew hedge, he prudently refolved not to break the old wall 
vntil he had finilhed the new. 

Thanks to his indefatigable pains, the work was finilhed 
in a few days, and then Robinfon had the fatisfadtion of be- 
ing in the fame habitation with histhreedomefticcompanions. 
This, however, did not make him forget his firfl companion, 
the fpider, which he provided every day with goats and 
flies. The fpider, foon perceiving th^t he ufed her as a 
friend, grew fo tame, that, whenever he touched her web, 
ihe would cope out and receive from his hand the Ry that 
beheld to her. 

The lama^ alfo, and its young ones, foon g/ew fond of Kv^

fociety. A^ ofren ag he returned home, th'ejrcatnejuffipfttg 
to meet him ^ they would fmell aboat him to fidd Whether 
he had brought them any thing, and gratefully lick his hand 
whenever he gave thtxn fnSi grafs or youngbrabches to 
ear. 

After this he weaned the young ones^ and then begab to 
milk the dam regolarly morning and evening. His cocoa- 
nut ihells ferted him for pails and milk-pans, and thitmilk, 
yrhich he ufed partly fweet and partly curdled, contributed 
not a lirtle^, by its agreeable taile and nouri(hing quality, to 
render his folirary life ftill more tolerable. 

As his cocoa-nut tree was ufeful to him in fo many rc- 
• fp^ds, he was extremely defirous to find a method of pro- 
ducing more of them. But how was he to contrive it ? He 
had ofteb heard of grafting trees^ but the manner in which 
it was done had never excited his curiofity. V Oh,'* faid 
he to himfelf^ '* how little is the advantage that 1 have reap* 
' ed from theyears of my childhood, when I had time and oppor- 
tunity to have learnt fo much ! Ah ! if I had known my own 
intereft better, (hould I not have taken notice of every thing 
that I faw or heard ? And if my capacity did not allow me 
to arrive at the height of learning which many men attain, 
I (hould at lead have come near it ; and how ufeful would 
every thing that I could have learnt be to me at this prefent 
moment ! Oh ! if I could grow young again, how attentifc 
would I be to every thing that is executed by the hands 
or induftry of men ! There is not a trade nor an art of 
which I would not have endeavoured to learn feme part.** 

But of what ufe were thefe wi(hes f The misfortune wai 
now paft remedy. It was, therefore, his bufinefs to exert 
himfelf in fupplying by his own invention what he wanted 
io ikill ; and thi?/ in tffedt^ was the courfe that he took. 

Without knowing whether he was right or wrong, he 
cut off rhe tops of two or three young trees ; in the middle 
of the trunk he made a fmall (lit, in which he (hick a young 
twig from the cocoa-nut tree; he then covered round with 
thin bark the place where he had made the (lit, and waited 
with impatience for the refult of his labour. This, too^ 
fucceeded with him. After fome time the fuckers began 
to bud, and now he had found a method to produce a whole 
grove of cocoa-nut trees. 

Here was a fre(h caufe for rejoicing, and for entertaining 
ike mod lively gratitude towards our Creator, who has ini.

pfanted in the nature of things fuch virtues and qualities, 
that living creatures are no wherein want of meant to pre- 
fcrve themfelves, and render their condition agreeable. 

Both the old lama and the young ones were in a ihort time 
grown as tame as dogs. He began, therefore, by little and 
little, as occafion required, to make them ferve tor carrying 
bnrthens, efptrcially whenever he went out for any thing i}ia« 
would have been too much trouble for himfelf to carry, • 

Rich: Ay ; but bow could he take them with him whecbt 
there was no way for them to go out of the enclofure ? ' 

Mr. BilL I forgot to tell you, that, in the new wall,, 
at a part where it touched a clofe thicket, he had left an open- 
ing where a lama could barely fqueeze itfelf out. This hole 
was not to be Deen from without, and every evening Robin- • 
fon-clofed it up with branches ftrongly interwoven toge- 
ther. 

It was delightfubto fee Rbbinfon coming honre to his ha«

able to find the way as well as her mailer^ and when (he 
came to the little door ihe (topped firft to be unloaded,' and^ 
tliea crept in upon herbelly, Rbbinfon following by the 
Ame pa(rage. Then was the joy of the young lamas com^

Harriet. What dog ? 
^ Rich, Have you forgot him ? The dog, that fayed the 
liyes of two men. 

Harriet, Dear Richard, tell us that flory. 

Rich, There was once a man in Switzerland, where 
thofe high nlbuntains the Alps are. Well, the man 
climbed up to the top of one of them^ which was prodigioua 
high; oh, it was as high, as high— >as if you were topuf 
St. Paul's upon itfelf ten times over. 

Geo. You leave out one thing> brother; he took a guide 
with him. 

Rich. Certainly, he took a guide— ^ell, and the guide 
took his dog. .Now^ when they had reached the top of the 
mountain ■ .. 

Geo. Yes> and the mountain was covered with fnow— « 

Rich. Pray hold your tongae— Well, theo^ the mouii- 
tain was all covered with fnow. Now, when they were al* 
moil at the top, the gentleman flipped, and the g&ide going 
to his affillance Hipped too, and (o then they both flipped 
and Aid until they were within a few yards of the edge of 
the precipice, from which they would have fallen down aU 
moft a mile before they touched the bottom. But then the 
good dog feized bis mailer by the fi^irt of hiscoat^ and held 
him fafl, fo that he could not flip any farther, and he held 
the gentleman until they both got up. 

Geo, Well, now you mufi tell us what the gentleman 
jaid ; I have not forgot it. 

Riehs Nor I neither. He invited the guide to come 
and fee him as often as he pleafed at his houie, and charged 
him never upon any account to forget bringiog his dog, aa 
he intended, whenever he came, to give him a good l^lly- 
full. 

Harriet, And did the gentleman do fo ? 

Rich. Yes, certainly : as often as the guide vifited him, 
he entertained him in the beft manner be could, and was al- 
ways fure to gite the dog a full belly. 

Harriet, That was well done. 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dear children, we have loft fight of

Gio. Oh, dear papa« do. A little more of RobinfoD^ let 
it be ever fo little. 

J)/r. Bill, By this time his bricks were hard eoough to 
be ufed. He looked, therefore, for fome chalky earth, with 
which, ioftead of lime, he intended to make mortar for bif 
wall ; and he found fome. In the next place, he made 
himftlf a trowel of a flat (lone, and, being refolved to hays 
every thing complete that belongs to a bricklayer, he wenr 
fo far even as to make a fquare and a plummet,. but not in a- 
bungling manner ; as perfei^ as poilible. You knoWt I 
fuppofe, what thofe things^ are ? 

Eiiw. Oh f as to that matterj we have feen them prett/' 
often. 

Mr, BllL Having, therefore, fini(hed all the preparativjet^ 
requiiire for his nuionry , he made his lama bring borne • 
tbe bricks that he had occafion for. 
. JRiih* But how was he able to put. the bricks qpoa-tho 
lama? 

Mr. Bill, Why, indeed, you would not eaGly guefs how 
he contrived it, therefore 1 think it beft to tell you at once. 

He had long obferved that it would be a very great ad« 
vantage to him to know fomethingof the ufeful art of weav« 
sng wicker panniers ; but he had taken fo little notice ia 
bis youth of the manner in which baiket-makers work» that 
ke knew as much of this art,. which, neverthelefs, is tole«^ 
t%\Af eafy, as he did of all the other ufeful arts, that is^ to 
ikfs he knew nothing about ir»> 

However^.as he had once focceeded in making an um«- 
brella by this ibrt of weaving,- he frequently afterwarda 
amufed himfelf in his leifure hours with trials of the (amQ 
kind, by diot of which he difcovered at length the whole 
myftery of the art, fo as to be able to make a pretty tight 
pannier;. Two of thefe he bad woven on purpofe for his 
lama to carry. He fadened them together with a A ring, 
and laid them upon the lama in fuch a manner that they 
hung down one on each iide. 

Geo. Oh, papa ! I (hould like to learn baiket-making. 

Mr. BiU. Well, then, I. will fpeak to a baiket-maker

' Mr. Bill By all means ; it can do you no harm. la

when this bafket- making would come in quite it^afonably. 

Robinfon then fell to his bricklaying, in which- he fuc- 
ceeded toleraWy well. He had now built up one of the 
lide walls of his kitchen, and laid the foundation of the 
dcher, when all of a fudden there haFppened fomething 
which he had never dreamt of, and which terribly difap- 
pointed all his plans. 

Rich. I wonder what that acetdent wa«. 

Harriet, Oh ! 1 know it. The favages came and ale

Mr BilL No, it w^s not that ; but it wat- fbmething

come to road him alive. ' 

Richk Dear me ! what was it ?• 

Mr, BilL It was night, and Robinron on his bed of hvf 
flept foundly, with his lamas at his feet. The moon (hone 
•ut in all its fplendor, the air was clearaod calm^ and a pro» 
#bund. iilence reigned over all^ nature. Robinfon, fatigued 
with the toils of the day, was fallen into a fweet flamber, 
and dreaming, as ufual, of his dear parents, when fuddenlyi 
---^but lei us not clofe this evening's- entertainment with 
an event fo full of terror; we might, perhaps^ dream of it,

KOBfNSO'H CItVS02. 9I 

They were qoite unp&tient to know what this was that 
Bad happened to poor Robinfony and they would any of them 
have given their favourite plaything to be informed of the 
evcjitfi of that dreadful night, concerning which Mr. Bil- 
lingiley had fo long kept filence. Unfortunately, it^was not 
in the power of any other perfon but their father to inform 
them, and. he thought proper to fay nothing of it until he 
fliould have time to continue the ftory regularly as ufuaL 

Their conjeftures were endlefs, and only ferved to puzzla 
diem more and morci One gueffed this thing, another 
that ; but none of their gueffe* agreed entirely with the cir- 
camAances which they already knew of this myflerious ad- 
vent ure. 

** But why fhould we not know tke whole ?" faid fome 
of them, in a very piteous tone. 

*** I have my rcafons,'* anfwered their father.. 

The children were, by a prudent education, accuftomed 
to be fatisfiedwith this anfwer, and therefore prefTed no far- 
ther, but waited with a guarded impatience for the moment 
when the caufe of their father's filence fhould? no longer 
esaft. Mean time, as it is cafy for a grown-up perfon to read 
the thoughts of children, Mr. Billingfley could clearly per-* 
ceive what paffed in theW^dnds. The following reflexion 
was written, as it were, \iftm the forehead of each of them : 
•* Why does our papa refufe us this fatisfaftion ? What rea» 
ions can he have for not gratifykig our curiofity?** He 
thought proper, therefore, upon this occafion, to convince 
them once more thathe did not want the inclination to- make 
them as happy as lay in his power, and to (hew them that he 
had reaibns of importance far not continuing -the ilory. 

*• Prepare yourfelves," faid he, ** to fet off to-morrow 
monung very early on a party down the river for Green- 
wich. Vou have often wiihed to fee it, and to-morrow I 
JjTopofeto kidulge you." 

■ "Down the river ?— To Greenwich ?— In a boat?-^-^ 
What I, papa ?— Shall I go ?— And I ?'* afted aH the chil-* 
dren with one voice ; and a general *' 3^«'* having fatis- 
fied all their qneitions^ they ran, ^oite* transported with joy,. 
to communicate the news* to > their mama, and to make the- 
tteceflaiy preparatkns for their voyage. 

«* To Greenwich ! to Greenwich I ' Where are my half^ 
koots ? J^nny, vrherc are.- my gloves ? Quick ! the bru(h!' 
the comb. \ We are a going to Greenwich ! Quick ! quick l-^ 



^Z T H 1 KF E W 

Nothmg WAS to be heard, all over the koufe^- but tfaeie ex^ 
preffions of joy and impatience. 

' Every tmng> therefore, was prefMured for the next day's 
party ; and the young travellers^ in the fulnefs of their joy,. 
alked a thousand queftions, without waiting tor a ^gle an- 
fiver. They were, at lengdi^ however,prevailed oo to gojt^> 
bed for that nighty their impatience being £0 great that they 
were already wishing for die morning to fet out on theip 
joumeV. 

At lenffth die morning appeared » and the whole houfe* 
was in motion. Nothing was heard but knocking at each' 
other's bed rooms ; fo t£^ they were all vpry foon obliged, 
to rife anddrefsthemfelves. 

When the whole party, old and young,, were aiTembled,, 
and the former were almoft devoured with careifes by the 
latter ; Mr. BiUingiley rubbed his eyes, and in a tone of 
iFoice which breatl^d moft forrowful difcordto the accents 
of univerfaljoy, he iaid, ** My dear children, if you would- 
do me a favour^ you would excufe me to-day from perform* 
kg my promife." 

''What promife? what promife ?"-— and each mouth: 
that afked this (j[ueftion remained open in anxious expeda^

do wrong to go on this party to-day. 

The dfiUrm. Why fo, papa ?^— and they could hardly^ 
(peak for fobs. 

Mr. Bill* I will tell you, and then leave it to yonrfelws^ 
to judge. In the firft place, we have had, for fome.dme 
paft,. aa.eailerly wind (and, I find, it is in the fame point 
this morning), r which makes the river extremely rough,- and 
nraft be very diiagreeable to aparty that are going down. 

Tb$ ChiUreftr But, papa, the wind may change ftill. . 

Mr. Bill. Befides, I confidered, that, if we were to £bof 
another month, we (hould fee many of the Eaft India fhipt,k

Mr, Bill, But I have Aill a Wronger rcafon. Yoa knovfrj 
Charles and Arthur StanfieM, your firft couilns, whom yoa 
Kave never feen yet, are to come out of Chefhire (hortly , and 
ipend a month with us ; would it not be infinitely better to

not, as often as we fhoaldfpeak to them of the agreeablenefs 
of our p2rty, figb and wim that they had been there too h 
And, in that cafe, would the remembrance of our day's plea*

What is to be done 2 

. '* We will wait" was the anfwer ; and,.confequentlyj. the 
tneparty of pleafure was put off till another time. 

1 1 was eafy to be feen tlmt this vi6lory over themfelves had 
ood (bme of them dear : thefe were far from being as chear- 
fol as ufual the reft of the day. Mr. Billingfley took eco^ 
fipn, therefore, towards evening, when they were all affem^ 
kied, to fpeak to them in this manner : 

** My dear children, what has happened to yoa tD-da)r# 
. will ha{)pen to you ^equently in' the cpurie of your livef* 
Yoa will expe^ to enjoy this or that eiartiily advantage % 
your hopes will appear as well founded as poffible^ and yoK 
will burn with impatience to realize them ; but, in the verf 
moment when yon think to touch this long-expedled hap* 
pinefs. Divine Providence, which is fupremely wife, willj in 
an inftant, difappoint your defigns, when you fhall leafl ex* 
pe£k it; and thus you will find your too fanguine hopes ma* 
iiy, many a time (adly fruftrated. 

" The reafons which your heavenly Father will have td 
uSt thus with yoa, will feldom appear to you fo clearly and dif- 
tindly as you have heard my reafons this morning for putting 
off our party to Greenwich ; for God, being infinitely wife« 
looks to the mofl remote futurity ; and often, for our advan- 
tage^ fuffen things to happen^ the good cfft^ of which we 



54 T IT B K 1 W 

4o not experience until long after, perhaps even in anotker 
world. 

*' Now, if every thing were to happen perfe^y to your 
wifti while you are young, and if you always obtained, at the 
cxadl moment, whatever was the objeft of your hopes, oh ! 
my dears, how much the worfe would it be for you daring 
tiie remainder of your lives I How would your hearts be cor- 
rupted by fuch profperity ; and how unhappy would your 
aftftions, thus corrupted, make you at a time when things 
fliould not go quite to your liking ! And fuch a time wdl 
come, my £ars ; it will come as certainly for you as it comes 
for. all other men ; for hitherto there has never been a man 
in the world, who could fay that things have always fucceed- 
cd with him completely, and according to the fulncfs of his 
wKhes-; 

** In this cafe, then, what are we to do, my dear children? 
—No more than this; accuftom yourfelves, while. you are 
JfOung, to deprive yourfelves frequently of a pleafure which 
•ymi would have given the world to enjoy. This victory over 
yourfelves, ©ften repeated, will ftrenethen your underfbuid- 
ukjp and your affedhons in fuch fort, that, for the future, you 
wHl be able to fupportj with unfhak«n fortitude, whatever a 
irifeand benevofent God fhall appoint you for your good. 

** What I have faid^ will teactyou, my dear children, to 
interpret many inftances of our behaviour, which to you ap^ 
pear unaccountable^ and which we> who are advanced in year^^ 
commonly adopt with regard to you. You have, no doubt, 
often been iurprifed at our refvifing you a gratification for 
whifih^ perhaps, you longed ardently. Sometimes we have 
tolA-yovi. the reafons of our refuial ; that is, when you were 
capable of underftanding them ;- and fometimes, on the other 
hand, we have • not told you them ;- for inftance, when yon 
were too young -to be able to underlland them. And why 
did we do fa?» Often merely on purpofe to excrcife your pap 
tknce and moderation, virtues fo neceffary ta all men, ani 
to prepare you- for the fabfeqqent accidents of your lives. 

'* You know now, alfo, why, for thefe few days^paft, I 
have forborne the recital of Robinfon Crufoe's Hiftory. 1 
might certainly have found, at lead, fufHcient time to clear 
up to vou the adventure with which I left off, and concentr-

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

tgainU my will that I rcfufc you any thing. Now, why did 
1 do thus, Harriet?" 

Harriet. Becaufe, papa, you had a mind to teach QS 
patience. 

Mr. Bill. Very right I And moil certainly, if ever you 
have caufc to thank me for any thing, it will be for accut^ 
toming you thus to give up without regret any thing of which 
you have before ardently deiircd the pofTeflion. 

A few days more palTed without any talk of going on with 
the ftory of Robinfon Crufoe ; but, at length, the hour to 
earneftly longed for arrived, when Mr. Billingfley was no 
longer prevented by bufinefs or otherwife from latisfying the 
general wilh. He went on, therefore, without interruption, 
m thcfe words : 

It was night, as I told you at my leaving off, and Robin- 
fon was quietly Hretched on his bed of dry grais, with his 
faithful lamas at his feet. A deep calm overfpread all the 
face of nature, and Robinfon, according to his cuftom, was 
dreaming of his parents, when, fuddenly, the earth fhook 
in an uncommon manner, and a rumbling noife was heard, 
together with dreadful cracks, as if many ftorms burft forth 
allat once. 'Robinfon flarted up in a fright, and jumped out 
of bed without knowing what was the matter, nor where 
he was going. At this moment happened a dreadful (hock 
of the 'earth, which was fucceeded by feveral others equally 
. violent. The rumbling ncnfe alfo continued, which feemed 
to come from under ground. At the fame time arofc a 
furious hurricane, which tore up trees, and even rocks, and 
agitated the very depths of the roaring fea. A 11. the elements 
feemed to be at war with each other, and nature to approach 
her ^nal difTdution . 

Robinfon, almoft frantic with terror, ran out of his cave 
into the fpace before it, and the afFrighted lamas followed.^ 
Scarce were they out, when a piece of the rock, which refted 
'^ver the cave, fell down upon the bed which Robinfon had 
juft Ifcft. Fear, now, lent him wings ; he fled with precipi- 
tation through the fmall opening in his wall of trees, and the 
lamas, no l^s terri^.ed, were clofe at his heels. 

His firfl intention was to fecure himfelf upon a neighbour- 
ing mountain, on the top of which was a plam perfedly open, 
that he might not be in danger of the falling trees. He was 
going to run thither, when fuddenly he beheld, to his ia^« 
ttiti tenor and furprife, that very fame fpot of the mountain 



96 T H K N E W 

open with a huge gap^ and vomit forth Tmoke, fire, cinders, 
Hones > and a burning ftream of what is called la'ufl* He 
^uld fcarcely tell which way to run from this dreadful erup- 
tion, as the burning lava "rolled down the hill like a river, 
and great fragments of rock were hurled into the air, m 
every diredlion, and fell as thick as hail. 

He ran towards the fea-fide; but here he beheld a newfcene 
no le{s terrible. A dreadful whirlwind, which blew From all 
quarters of the fky, had driven together a large quantity of 
douds, and heaped them, as it were, one upon the other. 
"Their own weight burft them at length, and the confequence 
was fuch a deluge of rain, as, in a moment, laid the whole 
country under water. 

Robinfon faved himfelf with difficulty by climbing up a 
tree ; but his poor lamas were carried off by the violence of 
the flood. Ah ! how it w ent to his heart to hear their plab- 
tive bleatings ! and how willingly would he, at the rifk of 
his own life, have endeavoured to fave them, but that the 
rapidity of the torrent liad already carried them far beyond 
his reach ! 

The earth ftill continued to (hake for a few minutes, after 

which there fell, all at once, a dead calm* The winds fab* 

£ded ; the opening of the mountain ceafed by degrees to 

^ vomit fire ; the rumbling under ground was heard no more i 

^'the fky cleared up, and all the waters fan off in lefs than a 

quarter of an hour. 

Geo, (Jighing hea'vUy) Ah! thank God, it is all over! 
Poor Robinfon and the poor lamas !■ 

Harriet. For my part, I was terribly frightened. 

Charlotte. What occafions thefe earthquakes, papa ? 

"Rich, Papa has exf^ined that to us "long ago, but yea 
were not here. 

Mr. Bill. Tell her,. Richard. 

Rich. There are a number of great holes under the earth* 
Eke caverns,, and thefe are filled with air and exhalation.*;, 
.llefides, there are within the earth all manner of things that 
cafily take fire, as fulphnr, pitch, nitre, an J the like. Thefe 
begin fbmetimes to heat and take fire, whea moiflurc hap« 
>|)ens to accompany* them. 

Geo. Moiflore? Can wetnefs,. then, occafion any thing to 
take fire? 

Rich. Certainly. Have, you never feen, when^ malbns 
chroiv cold water upon, burnt lime-fiones, how they bepn 

imffled&tely 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

immediately to boll and &ioke as if they were upon the fire, 
and yet there was no fire near them i W^IU in the fame 
manner things take fire under ground as foon as water 
penetrates to them ; and then, when fhey burn, the air which 
IS in thefe great caverns expands fo prodigioufly that there 
is no longer room to contain it, fo that, ftriving forcibly to 
find a paSage out, it ftiakes the earth, until, at length, it. 
makes an opening cfomewhere, and through this opening it 
comes forth like a hurricane, drawing with it a quantity of 
burning and melted matter. 

■ Mr. BilL And this matter, which confifts of ftones, mi- 
nerals, and undhious bodies, all melted together, is what we 
call Li'va, I have fomewhere read that a man might make a 
little moantain for himfelf that would vomit fire. If you 
ihould Kke that, we will make the experiment feme day. 
The t^bildren. Oh, yes, by all means, dear papa. 
Rich, And how is that done? 

Mr, Bill* You need only dig a hole in the ground where 
it is moiil, and put into it fome fulphur and filings of iron. 
This mixture will heat and take fire of itfelf, and then yott 
have a burning mountain in miniature. We will make a 
trial of it the nrtt idle day. 

While Robinfon was comings down from the tree on which 
he had fav^d himfelf, his mind was fo deprefifed with the 
calamity which had juft fallen on him, that he never once 
thought of thanking for his freih deliverance that Being who 
had before, more than once, preferved him when in the moft 
unminent danger of periihing. His fituation was, indeed^ 
now, to the full as miferable as ever it had been. His cave^ 
the only place of refuge that he had hitherto found, was, in 
all probability, a heap of ruins ; his dear and faithful lamas 
he had feen, with his own eyes, carried ofiT by the flood, and 
Without doubt they muJft have perifhed ; all his pafl labour; 
were demolifhed, and his plans for the future difappointed ! 
The mountain, it is true, had ceafed to throw up fire, but 
from the gulph, which was ftill open, on the top of it, there 
ififued forth a thick black fmoke, and it was very poffible that 
tlus mountain might now continue to be always a volcano^ In 
that cafe, how was Robinfon to enjoy one moment's fecurity ? 
Might he not reafonably dread a frefh earthquake, or afrefh 
eruption, every day ? 

Thefe melancholy ideas completely overpowered him. 
H« fttnk under the weight of his miferies, and, inltead of 



98 T H B N £ W 

tumingliimrelf towards Goi, ihe onhrfource ef true con&Ia*; 
tkm/ he thought of nothing but his future mifory, which aip- 
peered to him infinite both in weight and duration. 

Exhaufled with angmfh and difcomfort, he leaned againll 
the tree^ and, from his pained breaiii;, he uttered figlS^ or 
rather deep groans, of diih-efs. He remained in this pofitIon> 
the picture of defpair, until the dawn told the approach of 
day. 

Geo. (to Mr. Meredith.) I fee now that my papa was right. 

Mr. Mered. In what ? 

.Geo. I was thinking lately that Robinfon was altogether 
reformed, and that Providence might Tafely order things for 
his deliverance from the iiland ; but in anfwer to that my 
papa obferved, that our heavenly Father knew every thing 
beft> and that it was not for us to judge in fuch cafet • 

Mr. Mered, And now ? 

Geo. Why, now I fee plainly that he had not the confi- 
dence in his Maker which he ought to have had, and, there- 
fore, that God did well in not delivering him yet. 

Ednv. So I think too. I muft own, 1 am far from liking 
liim now fo well as I did fome time ago. 

Mr. Bill, Your obfervation, my dear children, is perfedUy 
juD:. It is true, we fee plainly that Robinfon has not that 
fLrin, unalterable filial confidence in his Maker which he na- 
turally ought to have after fo many proofs of his wifdom and 
foodnefs as he had experienced ; but, before we condemn 
im on- this head, let us firil put ourfelves in his place for a 
moment, and afk our own hearts if wa fhould have aded 
better under the fame circum fiances. What think you, Ed- 
ward ? If you had been Robinfon, would you have hadmoro 
epuraige than he ? 

Edw. (hefitatingj I- can't fay. 

Mr. Bill. Recofiedl the time when you had fore eyes, and 
we put bli]^rs behind your ears. Do you remember how 
^ifjpirited you were at times ? And yet it was but a fhort- 
Hved piain ; it lafled but two days. I know, indeed, that 
ou have more fenfe now, and would bear the pain better ; 
fut could you alfo bear with filial fubmiifion every thing that 
Robinfon was forced to undergo ?-r— What think you, my 
dear ? Have I not fome reafon for dx)ubtin^ upon that fcore ? 

Your filence is the beft anfwer to my queSion. As, thank 
Heaven, you have never been in a fituation like that of our 
poor friend Robinfon, you cannot tell what wou'd be your

is to accuftpm oarfelves, in the flight misfortunes which ws 
perhaps mnft eirperience, to tiim our eyes cowards Heaven^ 
and be e^er patient and full of confidence. Onr hearts will 
then be more and more ilrengthened every day, fo as to 
^bear with diie refignatioif > even the greatefl lufierings, if our 
heavenly Father fhali think proper to appoint them to us. 
' , At len^ the day appeared, and its new-bom light, wJule 
it'ipread joy over aU nature, i^und poor Robinfon ^1 leaning 
againft the tree, in a iitaation truly deplorable. Sleep had 
never eloTed his eyelids ; one gloomy thought alone abforbed 
his whole foul $ he had aiked himfelf a thoufand times th&ibr« 
rowful queftion, ** What will become of me ?" At length he 
fet himfelf in motion, and flaggering as he walked, like a man 
* who is half afleep, he arrived, after fome time, at the ruins of 
his habitation. But what joyful emotions feized his breaft, 
when, all at once, as he came up towards the willowendofure— ^ 
what think you ?-- his dear {amas, fafe and found, came jump- 
ing to meet him ! At firft he could not believe his eyes, but 
his doubts were foon fatisfied. The lamas ran up to him, 
licked his hands, and exprelTed their joy at feeing him agajn 
by bleating and &ippin^ about. 

Robinfon's heart, which, until that moment, had feemed 
infenfible and frozen, was now awakened. He looked at 
his lamas, then up to Heaven ; and tears of joy, ^titude^ 
ittid repentance for»his want of faith, bedewed. his chedcSb 
He now patted and carefTed his old fiends a thoufand times» 
and, accompanied by them, went to fee what was become of 
his habitation. 
' Henfy. Hut how were the lamas faved ? ■* 

Mr. Bill, We may fuppofe that the flood had carried them 
to fome rifing <gro(md where the waters were not quite fo 
deep, and as they ran off afterwards ^s rapidly as they had 
fallen from the clouds, the lamas were very foon able to re>- 
tnm to their habitation. 

Robinfon then Hood in the front of his cave, and, to add 
to his confufion, found the damage here alfo by no means fb 
confiderable as, in the height of his defpondency, he had ima- 
gined it. The cieling, which confifted of one piece of rock, 
had, it is true, tumbl&d down, and in its fall brought fome 
of the neareft earth along with it ; yet, after all, it appeared 
aot impoflible to clear the cave of thefe ruins, and then his 

dwelling- 



too THE N B W- : ■ 

dwdling^plice became twice as .fpacioos aod convenient a^- 
it was before. 

To this muft be added another circumftance^ whkh plain- 
^ ly demonibrated that Divine ProvideDce had. ordered events 
thus, not to puniih Robinfon, but rather exprefsly for his pre- 
fervation : for when he had more olofely exaouned the fpot 
where the piece of rock had been fufpended, he, to his no fmall 
terror, perceived it to be forroonded, on every fide by a foft 
earth, and, confeqoently , that it could never have been £nnly 
placed ; it was, therefore, likely enough to fall down by it« 
own weight fooner or later. Now, this-Divine Providence fore- 
faw, and perhaps, moreover, forefaw that the piece of rock 
would fall precifely at a time when Robinfon was in the cave. 
But, as the all- wife and good Creator had appointed to this 
man a longer life, he had, from the creation of the worlds 
fo formed the earth, that exactly at that time^ and in that 
iHand, there ihould be fuch an earthquake. Even the rum- 
bling noife under ground, and the roaring of the hurricane, 
how terrible foever they had founded in the ears of Robinfon, 
were circumflances that contributed to fave him : for, had 
the earthquake come on without any noife, Robinfon, in all 
likelihood, would not have awakened, and then the fall of the 
rock would certainly have put an end to his life. 

Thus, my childi^cn. Heaven took care of him at a time 
when he thought himfelf fc»iaken, and even made thefe 
dreadful accidents, which Robinfon looked upon as his great* 
£& misfortune, contribute wholly to his prefervation. 

This happy experience of heavenly mercy you will have 
frequent opportunities of gaining, if you wifh to remark the

TENTH EVENING. 



JifR. BILLINGS LET goes m.— Robinfon, who for 
fomc time paft had ufed die cuftom of joining prayer 
with his labour> began by throwing himfelf on his knees to 
thank God for his late deliverance ; after which he chearfully 
fet aboiit his work> which was to dear his cave of the ruins. It 
v.tL$ but a flight tafk'to remove the earth and the gravely but 
there remained flill the great piece of rock, which had been 
under all. It is true* it was brokea in two ; but even in this 
Hate it feemed to require more than the ftrength of one maa 
todiflodge it. 

He tried to roll out the fmalleU of the two pieces, but in 
rain : the tafk was too much for his flrength. An attempt fo 
far from fncceeding difconraged him once more.. He did 
not know what to try next. 

Ricif* Oh, I know what I fhould have done. 

JWr. 5/77. What ? ^ 

Richi t would have made a lever, or a crow, fuch as tke 
men had the other day when they rolled A great beam into 
the barn-yard. 

^iif^ I was hot by then. What is a lever, or a crow, as 
you call it?' 

Rich, it is a long ftout pole ; one end they put under the 
beam or the ftone that they wi(h to move, and then they place 
St little block or flone under the lever, but as clofe as poffible 
to the beam or whatever elfe is to be rolled along ; then lay- 
ing their hands on the other end of the lever, which they 
prefs uith iSL ^eir force upon the block, the beam is thus 
raifed up, and may be rolled without much trouble. 

Mr, BiH. I will explain to you the reafon of that another 
time : at prefent liften and hear what Robinfon did. 

After havin? meditated upon the matter a long time to na 
^urpofe, the idea of the lever Uruck him too at laft. He re- 
colledled that when he was young he had fometimes feen 
workmen make ufe of this infb-ument when they wanted ta 
inove very heavy loads« and he haftened to make a trial of it. 



i02, T H 1 K E W 

l^his fiwceeded^ In half an Iwur he rolled the t\v& pieces 
X)f ftone clean out of the cave, which four men with their 
hands alone could not have llirred from their places ; and 
then he had th^e iatlsfadion of feeijijg; Ifis dwellmg twice as 
fpacious, as before, <and, what was of infinitely more confe- 
quence, quite fecurc as far as the eye could examine : for 
now both the walls and the cieling coniiHed of one hollow 
rocky in which there could no where be difcovered the fmall* 
til crack. 

Ei^w, But» papa> what was become of his fpider ? 

A/r. Bi/L 1 am glad you put me in mind of it. Poor 
spider ! I'hadalmoft tbrgot it, Bat« in truth, I can tell yon no- 
thing about it^ unlefs that, according Co all appearance, it was 
buried under the ruins of the cieliog ; at leall^ Kobinfbn never 
faw it again: however, bis ether friends, the lamas, mad^ 
him amends for its lofs. 

He now ventured to turn his fteps towards the volcano, 
from which a black ihioke llili continued to rife. He was 
aftoniihed at the quantity of melted matter that had run from 
it on all fides, part of which was nojt cold yet. For this time^ 
therefore, he only admired » at a diilance, the grand, but 
dreadful fight of the fmokin^ gulf, becaui^ fear, and the 
lava, which was ilill too hot, hindered lum from approacliing 
nearer. 

Hanng remarked that tke principal Hreatn of lava had 
taken its courfe towards the fpot where his potatoes grew« be 
was much terrified at the idea that this torrent of fire might, 
perhaps, have laid wafle the whole place ; nor could h^ be 
eafy until he fatisfied himfelf on this head. He nent, 
therefore, to the fpot, and found, to his great joy, the whole 
plantation fafe and found. From that moment, he refolved, 
at all hazards, to plant potatoes in many different parts of 
his ifland, in order to prevent the misfortune of feeing him* 
felf deprived of fo admirable a fruit by jfome unlucky acci- 
dent or other. It is true* winter, according to his reckon^ 
ing, was now jull at hand ; " but," faidhe.toiumlelf, *' who 
knows whether thefe plants are not of the fort that will (land 
the winter ?" 

Having put this defign into execution, he began again to 
work upon his kitchen. Here alfo the terrible convulfion of 
nature which had jull happened, was the means of procuring 
him a great advantage ; for, you mult know, that the 
kuraing mountain had, amoogCt other things, throve n ud a 

coafidcraDle 



It06 f N S ON C KU S O £. laj 

€iAifideFab1e cjuantity of Umeilones. Thefe are commonly 
bontt kf » kihf before lime can be made of them^ but here thac 
Wa* noi^ fteceilary, for the burning mountain had already 
been as pood as a limekiln to them. 

Robinfon, therefore, had only to gather a fmall heap of 
thefe ftones, to throw water upon them> and then to ilir the 
heap well about. Thus the hme was flaked, and made pro- 
per for the malbn's ufe. He then mixed with it a little iandjt 
fell to work immediately, and had reafdn to be pleafed with 
his own devernefs^ 

In the mean time, the mountain had ccafed fmoking, and 
Robinfon ventured to approach the gulf. He found the fidcji 
and the bottom covered with cbld lava ; and as he could not 
perceive the leaft fmoke come out any where, he had reafon 
to hope that the fubterrancous fire was entirely extinguiihed* 
and that, for the future, he fliould have no eruptions to dread* 

This hope having given him frefh ilrength and fpirits, he 
turned his thoiight» towards laying in a (lore of proviiiona^ 
againft the winter. 'With tMs intent he caught, one after an- 
otiier, eifi^ht lamas, in the fame manner as he had caught the 
firfl. All thefe he killed, except one ram, which he kept 
.^ve to be company, for his three tame lamas ; and he hung 
op the greateft port of the fie(h in his kitchen to fmoke. Bwi 
firfl he had let it lie fome days in fait, becaufe he had re- 
membered to have feen his mother doib at home, when fhe 
made bacon. 

Here was a pretty good ftock of provifions; yet dill he 
dreaded left he mould fall fhort if the ivinter was fevere and 
lafled long. For thi» rea(bn,iie would have taken more la< 
" It he 



but he found his method would no longer anfwer ; for 
the creatures had, at length, taken notice of his manner - 
of noofmg them, and were, therefore, on their guard c 
fo that he was obliged to invent fome new way of taking 
thenx.^ 

. This way he feon found : to inexhaufliblc are the re- 
fburces of the human mind, if properly exerted, in providing 
for iXs wants , and encreafing its happinefs . He had obfe rved 
that the lamas, whenever they perceived him near the ipring^, 
ran fwiftly towards a neighbouring coppice, in theJj: way to 
which they paficd Qter a: little hill. ■ The farther fide of this 
hHl was hedged, as it were, with fmall thickets ; and clofc 
behind this &dge there was a defcenr as llcep as a wall, and 
about a! CPUple : of yards deep. Th« }jm^9> in their flight. 



104 THE NEW 

always JTtmped clean over the hedge^ and landed at ike lot* 
torn of the hiU ; and this obiervation determined him to dig 
a deep hole on this fpot, where the lamft5 jjomped down» that 
they might fall into it and be taken. His indjefati^^able la*- 
bour finiihed in a day and a half this new work of his inven- 
tion. The pit he covered over with green branches, and 
the next day had the fatisfadion of feeing two tolerable large 
lamas taken in it. 

He now thought himfelf fufficiently provided with meat. 
He would have been puzzled where to lay it all up dufittg 
the winter, if the earthquake had not . f orniflied him with a 
cellar in every refpedV complete : for clofc by his cave anoi 
^ ther piece of the hillock had funk about two fathom in depths 
and thereby formed a fecond cavern, opening, sH well as 
the firft, into his enclofure. He had now his dwelUng'apart- 
menty kitchen, and cellar, all adjoining each other, and 
placed a^onveniently as if they haid been planned and laid 
out by art. ' 

There now remained tliree thk^t 'Mre, wfikh done» be 
was to count himfdf folly guarded and provided; asainft tiie 
expelled approach of winter : hay was to be made for his 
lunas; a ftock of wood to- be laid np for firing ; and all his 
potatoes were to be dug up, and lodged in the cellar. 

Hay he had colleded in a pretty large quantity^ and 
ibcked it up in hit court-yard, ashaymakers do here ; and 
whenever he put frcfix hay on it, he trod it down fo hard that 
the rain could not eafily {oak into it. Bof^here experience 
taught him a little more of haymaking, though at the ex- 
pence of fome labour and trouble. 

You mufl know, he had not taken care to dry the hay per* 
fe&ly. Whenever this happens, and it is at the fame time 
prefTed down tightly in the Hack, it begins to heat, next to 
fmoke, and at length it takes fire. This wat' a matter that 
Robinfon had never heard of when he was youne ; for he had 
never much troubled his head about fimning bnfinefs ; but 
in his prefent fituation he learned how nfeful it is to renugrk 
every thing, and to collect as mnch information as poffible, 
even though we cannot forefee how far it may, one day or 
©ther, become ufefdl. 

His furprife was greai^ indeed, when he faw, all of a fiid* 
den, his haycock begin to fmoke; but he Wat (till modi more 
aflonifhed, when, on thruftbghis hand into it, he found the 
inlide burning hot. He cenld not pnfnade Umielf but chat

|(e hay was oa fire» dioogli he could not poffibly conceive 
h^ die fire co«dd get in tSere. 

He took dowathe haycock^ therefore^ as fail as pofllble ; * 
but was very muck furprifed to find no firei and to fee. that 
the hay was tvtty whejre extremely hot and moifl. He was, 
therefore, at laft« convinced* (as was really the cafe,) that 
the moifture alone caufed the hay to heat, though he could > 
in no wife* conceive how that (hould be. 
■ JUicif. I muil own I find it hard to imagine how wetneM 
alone can make any thing heat. 

Mr, Biti. My dear Richard, there are a thouiand fucii 
«fie£b as this in nature ; and human reafon, which hath been 
reflji^ing on them for many agesj hath clearly difcoyered 
the true caufes of many of them. Thefe ufeful difcoveries ar« 
dmipiifed in a fctence^ of which, perhaps, you do not know 
the name. It is calledNatund PMlofophy. There you may find 
the reaiba;of tMs remarkable efied of moifture« as well at 
jnany other appearances in nature that are extremely iingufer. 
And if you continue to apply yourfelf properly to the fciencei 
which you are leamiiig at prefent^ I will teach you aU^ that 
^ nttwral philosophy, which will give you inexjfveflible plea* 
fnre. Here it woidd be to no purpofe to introduce ity be* 
cuife you could not underhand what I fhould fay to you. 
. Robinibn then dried his hay afrefh, and made it up into a 
£reih haycock, which could Aand fecnre againfl both win4 
tad r^. To reiider it ftill more fecure, he topped it with 
a covering of reeds, fcarce inferior in finnnefs to our thatch 
roofs. 

For fome days following;, he employed himfelf ingathering 
«t much drv wood as he judged he flu)dd want. After this, 
lie dug ftp hi* potatoes, and fonnd them a very confiderable 
Hook. Thefe he laid up carefully in his cellar. Lailly^ he 
IfeiO^ the lemon-tree, and brought home as many of the ^uit 
•• were ripe, to preijsrve them too againft the winter ; and 
now he was freed from all appreheniions of want during die 
Wl weather. 

Bat though it was almoft the em) of Odober, the cold^ 
wUdl' tud made Robinfon fo uneafy, was not to be kk, 
ifrtiie leaft.^ Inftead of that, the weather turned to rain,. 
amlbit rained fo inceffiuitlv that the air feemed to be change^

viauals and wat^ lor himfelf and his lamas. The reft of 
the time he was obliged to pafs like a priibner. 

How heavily the hours crept on ! Nothing to do^ and all 
alone ! My dear childreiiy it is impoffible for you to ima- 
gine a greater mifery ! If any body could have given him 
a book> or pen, ink, and paper, he would, with great chear- 
fslneis, have given one day of his life for every fheet of pi- 
per. ** Oh!" faid he now and* then tohimfelf^ with a 
heavy figh, *^ how filly was I in my younger days to look 
^ upon reading and writing as fomething tirefbme, and idle« 
Befs as fomething ^reeable I The mo& tedious book in the 
world would now be a treafure to me, and! would prefer a 
fheet of paper, with pen and ink, to the pofTefTion of a. king- 
dom*"^ •-. . 

During this weariibme time, neceffity (breed him to Karo" 
I'eqourfe to all fcn-ts of employments which he had not hi- - 
therto tried. He had been meditating a long Ume whether 
it would not be poffible for him to make an earthen po^ and a 
Jamp; things which would have Tendered his fituatioa in*» 
comparably better. He ran, therefore, in the middle of di« 
Tain, to look hr potter's earth ; and, having found a fuffi-i 
cient quantity of it, he immmediately began to work. 

The making of earthen vefTeb did not fucceed with him 
all at once : he made many ineffe^ual trials at firft^ bnt^ 
having nothing elfe to do. as often as his work was fi- 
nifhed, and not to his liking, he ami^ed himfelf with breaks 
ing it to pieces, and beginning afrefh. He fpent a few 
days in this manner, his work affording him amufement ra« 
ther than trouble, until, at length, his pOt and lamp yr^re 
finifhed fo complete, that it would have been ill-nature to 
break them again. He placed them, therefore, in his kitch* 
en, not far from the iire> to dry gradually. After this, he 
went on making other pots, pans, and pipkins, of different 
^apes and fues ; and the more he pra^ifed this work» the 
inore ready he became at it. 

The rain continued, in the mean time, wkhout inter* 
ivption. Robinfon> therelb're, faw hjimfelf under the necef- 
'£ty of inventing other domefUc labours to keep himfelf 
from the unpleafant eifedls of having nothing to do. Hi| 
JbA talk was to make a fiihing«net.. He had laid in» belqnm 
hand, a pretty good flock of packthread, which came now 
very feafonably into ufe. As he took time enougl^ and 
^had the patieQC^ to try a thing ten times or more; mich did

T^t fucceed with him at firll, he found, at length, the true- 
method of making the knots, and he became as clever at 
the lAor]^ as any woman or girl in this country who prafiifes^ 
making nets or purfes : for he had invented alio an inllruraent 
of wood, which he cut with his knife of flint, fomething in 
the form of a fpit ; and with this he contrived to make a net, 
which, forgoodnefs and real ule, was little inferior to our 
common fiibing^ets. 

hs next came into his head to try whether he eould not 
make a bow and arrows.. 'J^ke thou^it of thk'f&t- him all^ 
alWe^whcD'heamiidered the many great advantages that a; 
lu>v -would procure him ! With a bow and arrcM s he could 
kill lamas, he could (Hoot birds, and — what was by far 
more important— with thefe he could defend himfclf in his^ 
dwelling-place, if ever the favages came to attack him. He 
was ill inlpatience to fee the bow fini(hed, and ran, notwith- 
ibnding the rairi and the wind, to look for the proper wood*- 

Forit was not every fort of wood that was fit for the pur- 
pofe ;r it fhould be at the fame time hard and fupple, that on- 
the one hand it might- be bent without jnuch diiiiculty, andi 
on the other, wheabent, might endeavour to return to iia^ 
ibrmer ftate. 
' Rkff\ It (hould be elafiic^ papa r fhould it not ? 

Mr, Biit, The very thing. I did not know that you re- 
membered the fignification'of that word, and, therefore, h 
did not chufe to make ufe of it.

But, alas ! how did he then feel the want of a propej: knife T

Vfhen he killed the Iamas» he would have tried, perhaps^ tot 
make firings of their gats ; for he knew that| in EoropCj it 
is common to make them out of (heeps guts. For want^ 
therefore, of catgut, he twifted a (bring of packthread, and- 
made it as flrong as poffible. After Sxis, he proceeded X19 
make his arrows. 

What would he have given for a fmall jnece of iron to- 
point his arrows with ! But wifhing was to no purppTe. A* 
he Aood at the door of his cave, confidering how he might 
(apply the want of iron points to his arrows, he turned his 
eyes, by chance, on the lump of gold which Izy there ftill on^ 
the ground as a thing of no ufe. " Go,'' faid he, fpuming 
It with his foot, ** go, ufelefs metal, and become iron, if yon 
with that I fhould value you ! ^ And, with thefe words, h^ 
turned away from it^ not deigning tolook at it again. 

fiy dint of thinking on the fubjeft over and over again, he> 
at length) rememb^ed to have heard thapt the iavages of 
fome nations make uie of fiih-bones ajad fharp ftones to point 
their lances and arrows; and he refolved to inmate them ia 
this refpedl : at the fame time he formed the defign of mak^ 
ing a lance or fpear. 

Thefe two things were immediately put into execution. 
He ran to the fea-fide, and was lueky enough to find fome^ 
Ifh-boi^s And fharp flints, exa^y fudi as he wanted. After 
^ds, he cut a lon^r ftraight flaff for the ipear, and returned, 
home wet to the vr' || fkin. 

In a few days th«rfpear and the arrows were finifhed. He 
had pointed the fpear with a fharp ftone, and the arrows with 
ibong fifh- bones ; to the other end of his arrows he tied. 
featiiers, to make them^ fly the better. 

He then tried how hi$ bow would fhoot : though it wanted, 
a number of things, which he could not poflibly add to it for 
wamt of iron tools, he found it, however, tolerably handy for 
ftpoting birds, or other fmall animals. He did not eve% 
doubt but he fhould be able, with this bow, to wound a naked; 
£ivage dangeroufly, provided the lavage would let him come 
liear enough. He had flill better resuon to be pleafed with 
his fpear. 

}fii earthen pots andL his lamp feemed now to be fuflkientlf 
dry. He refolved, therefore, to make ufe of them, in the 
iirft place, he put into one of his new«pipkins a lump of far»

a conjecture which experience very fo<m verified.

Mr, Bill, Without doubt it was fo ; and fome people, that: 
I know, would have been provoked to fiing all the work a-^ 
mray, and never meddle with pot-making a^ain. But Ro- 
binfon was, by this time, pretty well pradhfed in patience^ 
and had taken it fttongly in his head that a thing (hould never 
be done by halves, wmle it was poffible to finifh it completely. 

He fat down, therefore, in his ftudying corner (for fo he- 
called one of the corners of his cave, where he vStd to fit 
down when he had a mind to exercife his invention) , andv 
diere he rubbed his forehead. *• Whence comes itj" faid he

it begins to melt, they take it out left it Ihould be entireljf

No" fooner,faid than done : he kindled a good fire in hir

make a fecond trial. 

This fucpeeded rather better. The pipkin did not fpUt j

yet I thought the fire was hot enough. What can k poffibly

ter, he thought, at length/hehad hit upon the reafbn. He 
had made the experiment with a fire which was not cloicd up 
in a ftove or oven, but burned in the open air. This fire 
loft its force too fbon, and was too much fpread on every 
£de to heat the earthen ware fufficiently for glazing it. Ro^ 
binfon, therefore, determined to ftick to his principle of not 
doing things by halves, and to conftrudt a proper oven oc 
furnace like thofe in the potteries ; but for this it was rt- 
quifite that the weather fhould be more £ivourable.

Mr. Bill. Every thhig that he wants has he ? 

G§o. Ye&t has not he potatoes and meat, and fait and 
femons, and fiih and turtle, and oyders ; and do not the la<-' 
mas give him milk ? He can make butter and cheefe now. 

Mr. Bill. So he has too,, for fome time pad,, though I for*

Geo: Well, aaidthen he has a bow andarrews^^ and afpear^ 
and a fnug place to live ia. What more could he wi(h ? 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon knew very well the value of all thefe» 
good things^ and thanked God for them ;, neverthelefs, he 
would have given the half of his remaining life for the cUtival 
^f a (hip that wouM carry him to his* own country. 

Ge0^ Av I Why what did he want ftiU ? 

Mr. Bill. Many things ; an infinite deal of things, not to 
lay every thing. He wanted thofe blcfllngs without which'' 
tiiere can be no true happiaefs here below, as fociety , friends, 
beings erf" his ownfpecies, whom he might love, and by whomf 
he might 1)6, in his turn,, beloved. Far from his parents^

Harriiti Oh fie I Would yon have him go naked t 

Mr. Bilh It is true, he had no occafion for doaths to 
prot^^ him fit>it» the cold ;. bUt he had much occafion for 
them to guard his body from the infers with which this iiland 
iwarmed, particularly mufldtoes^ 

Bdw. What are thefe creatures, thefe muflatDes I 

Mr. Bill, A fort of flies « whofe fting is much more pain«- 
fitl thaiv that of ours^ In whatever country they are found, 
Aiey torment the natives' exceedingly ; for their ftings pro* 
dace almoft a« {>aiAful fweUings as tkofe of bees or wafps do

cocehis doaths- were won^outl and that time was coming 
irery faft.. 

This, together with his. eameft and longing^ defire to be- 
kold his parents, and fodety in general, once more drew 
inany a fi^ from him^ when fbindmg on the fea^fhbre, and 
]ooIang> with moiftened eyes, over the boundlefs ocean, he 
^oold'd^tinguiih nothing but the fea and fky« How did his 
heart fometimes flutter with empty hope, when, in the diflant 
hfiriMn, he perceived a fm^ cloud, which, his imagination 
veprefented to him as a fhip in full fail I And when, at. 
length, he difcovered his miftake, how the tears would trickle 
6iom his cyts,. and his heart feem ready to burft as he re* 
tartied home fk)wly tO:his habitation ! 

Harriet. He fhould have prayed fcM* the coming of a. fhip ; 
perhaps his prayers might have been heard, 

Mr. Bill. He didfo, my dear Harriet. He prayed night 
ttad day for his deliverance from the defert ifland ; but he 
never fergot^ at the fame time, to add, *^ Not mine, O

Left a reflel ihould happen any day to pafs or cad anchor 
near the illand, at a time when he was not near the fea- 
(hore, he refolved to fix, on the neck of land tvbich jutted 
out towards the fea> a fignal by which aH who fliould come 
in light might be informed of his diftref^. This (ignal was 
no more than a pole, on the top iA which he faftened » 
banner. 

Edw. Ay! Where did he get the banner ? 

Mr, BilL I am ||oing to tell you. His (hirt was then 
in fuch a ftate, that it was impodible to wear it longer. He 
took j therefore, the largeft flip of it, (haped it into a kind of 
banner orflag^ and fixed it on the pole that he was to-ftidt 
\jp. 

He would have been rery glad to put up al('o, upon his 
pole^ a labcl> with an infcription^ to give a clearer idea of Iris 
' diftreftf but how was this to be done ? The only way is 
his power was to cut out the letters with his knife of flinty 
Next to this the queftion was, in what language the in* 
fcriptioD flMHild be. If it wereEngUfb, there might come 
by (hips of other nations, as Dutch, Spanifh, or i^rendi^ 
Mid the people^might happen not to underfland it. Luckily 
he recoUeded foflne Latin words, by which he could t»^ 
preff what he wiAied. ' 

Geo, But would feamen underdand that } 

Mr* Bill. The Latin language* you know, is common in 
all countries of Europe, and molt men who have received 
any education, know, at leail, fomething of it. Hence 
Robinfon hoped, that, in whatever :^p pafTed that way» 
tiiere ijiight be one or two» at lea{i> wn^ would undeiftaM«, 
his infcription. He, therefore, put it up.

Hfnrj. Why? 

Mr. Bill. Becaufe, otherwife^ neither you nor I nor any. 
of us would ever have ezifted. 

Hiwy. How fo ? 

Mr, Bill, Becaufe we belong precifely to the mofi dc« 
Touring and deftrudlive fpecies of animals in the world». 
All the other creatures of the earth are not only our (laves, 
Jbut we even kill them at our pleafure ; fometimes to eac 
their flefh ; fometimes to have their (kins ; fometimes be- 
caufe they are in our way $ fometimes for other reafbns. 
which we could not eafily juftify. How much more caufe^ 
therefore, would the ioftds have to aik why that cruel ani- 
inal man was created ? Now, what would you anfwer to a 
fly that Ihould afk you this queltion ? 

Hefify (brfiating). Why— indeed I don't know. 

Mr* Bill. Now, for my part, I would (peak to him m 
Ihefe words : ** My friend Mr. Fly, your queftion is veqr 
incoaiidenuei, and (hews that vou have not a thinking 
bead, and that you know not the art of refledlion ; other* 
wife you would eafily have difcovered, with the fmalleft 
f^n of thought, that tbe Supreme Being hath, merely of 
his gopdnefs, created feveral of his creatures in fuch 
a manner that one is obliged to live upon others : for, if 
be bad not done fo, he could not have created by on« 
half fb many fpecies of animals as be has, becaUfi^ 
grafs and tbe fruits of the earth would have been fuf* 
fipient but for a few fpecies of living creatures. To tbe 
end, therefore, that all nature might be animated— thai 
there might be every where, in the water, in the air, and on 
t^e earth, living animals which (hould rejoice in their ex- 
ifience, and to tbe end that one fpecies of creatures migh^ 
not midtiply too much to the de(lru6tion of another, it 
was neceflary that our wife and good Creator (hould deAioe

He took the ikins, therefore, and cii«^ ^vx of them with hiir 
knife of flint, but not without a grea;ir^eal of troubre, firft a 
pair of (hoes, and then a pair of ftKkings. He could* liot 
lew either of thenv;. he was obl^cd, therefore, to content 
himfelf with making eyelet-holes- in. them >- and lacin]? them 
to his legs and feet with a fhing f which wa» no doubt fub-' 
jeft to great inconvenienc5c5^: for though he turn^tht hair 
outwards, he ftill felt a violent heat in his feet. Befides, 
die flcin, wWch was ftifF and hard, blillered his feet, and took 
the fkin ofT at the leaft attempt that he made to walk, aiid" 
fo caufed him verv great pain. However, he chofe to endure' 
this rather than tne flings of the muikitoes* 

Of another piece of fkin,.\^ich was very fSfFan<]^a little 
bent, he made a ma/k, cutting in it two fmall holes fbr the 
eyes, and another for the moinh^ that he might be able to 
breathe. 

Andy fince he had begun this work, he refolved not to qmt 
ft tmtil he had finifhed with makin| himfelf a jacket an^ 
trowfera^of lamas fkm. -It is tnie^this tafk was mudi more 
difficult ; but have we any thing without trouble ? and what 
n there in which we do not fucceed at lad^ with the requi* 
fite patience sgid application? Thos he atfo accomplifhed hit 
defign, which filled him with inexpreffible joy. 

The jacket was compofed of three jnece»,.which»were joined 
together by fbings. Two of rfiefe pieces^ierved foirthe arms*, 
and the third for the body. The trowlers cohfifted of twO» 
pieces,, one before and one behind, ^d they were laced at 
the fides. When the jacket and trowfers were finifhed, he?, 
put them both on, with the refolution never to drefs himfelf 
again in his old European- cftjaths, which were half torn tor 
pieces, except upon the birth-dayst of his father and mother> 
which he celebrated as folemn feflivafa. 

His drefs was then the moil fingular that can be-imagincdi 
from head to foot covered in fkins, with the hair outwards ; 
inflead of a fword, a large hatchet of ftone by his fide ; on 
1m» back a pouch, with a bow and quiver of arrows ; in his 
right hand a fpear almoft twice -as long as himfelf, and in bat 
Iwt a wicker umbrella, covered with leaves of the cocoa-nut 
, tree : laflly , upon his head, inflead of a hat, a cap of wicker- 
«vork, i-ifing in a point, and covered in the fSme manner with 
ikins, the hair outwards. Imagine to yourfelyes what a figure

*creatur^ ; nay, he could not help laughing at hknfelf, when> 
l)einc; 6n the bank of a rivulet, he faw his image in the water 
Ijn this ilre6 for the £r& time. 

After this, he returned his potter^s work. The oven wa« 
foon Unified, and then be had a mind to try whether, by 
fcrcje-of .an exceeding great fire, he could not produce a fort 
of glazing on his pots. He put them, therefore, and his 
pipkins into it, after which he made up by degrees fo great 
a fare, that the oven was red hot from one end to the other. 
This violent fire he kept up until evening, fulFcring it then 
to go out by degrees, and being very curious to know the 
ref^t of his lab^r. But what, think ye, was the rcfult of 
It? The firftpot that he took out was not glazed, notwith- 
{landing all that he had done; ' nor the fecond neither, nor, 
in (hort, any of them. But, at laft, in examining one of 
the pipkins, he perceived, with equal joy and furprife, that 
this, and this alone, was covered at bottom with a real 
glazing. 

This was to him a riddle which he could by no means 
foWe. *' What reafon in the .world coiUd there be," faid 

^he, " why this fmgle pipkin is a little glazed, and not one 

' of the other veffels, though they were all made of the fame 
earthy and baked in one and the (ame oven ?" — He thought 

' and thought again, but he was a long time before he could 
fee the lead glimpTe of any thing that feemed likely to ex* 
plain Ac rovftery. 

At length, he reeoUeded that there had been a little fait 
in this pipkin when he put it into the oven. He could not 

. help tlunking, th(^efore, that the fait alone mud be the 
«aufe of the glazing. 

J!ich» But was it really the fait, papa, that produced this 

■ cffcft ? 

Mr J Bill, Yes : what Robinfon now difcovered by chance 

. hias been long known in Europe ; the addition of fait is the 
true caufe why many things turn to glafs in the fire : fo that 

~ he o^y need l^ave rubbed the earthen ware with fait water, 

. or barely have thrown a little fait into the oven when heat- 
ed, and immediately all his pots would have been properly 
glazed. 

This, therefore, he refolved to try the next day. And 
pow the fire blazed under his oven, and alrcadv he had 
rubbed (bme of his veffels with fait water, and put ary (alt in 
Cfiha$, en purpofe to make the two experiments at the fame

lime, when, in the midft of his work, he was interrupted by an 
accident which he had dreaded a long time — he was taken ill. 

He felt pains in his breaft and head, and a ^reat weari- 
nefs all over hi^ limbs, and was threansned with the moft 
terrible fitaatioh that a man can poflibly experience. 

" Good Heaven !'* faid he to himfelf ; " what wUl be- 
come of me if I cannot rife out of bed ! if there is no, com- 
palBonate being to take care of me, and come to my affift- 
ance in my illnefs I no friend to wipe off the fweat of d^th 
from my forehead* or offer me any refrefhment !•— Heavens! 
what will become of me !" 

Sinking under the weight of his diflrefs, as he ikid thefe 
words he fell to the ground, quite jexhaujfted. 

Ah! it was in this moment of trial that he had more occafioa 
than ever to poilefs a firm and filial confidence is his heavenly 
Pather, who is every where prefent, and fupremely good. 
Deprived of all human afliftance, forfakeh by his own fbrength, 
what remained to prevent his dying in mifery ? Notmng 
but the adiilance of God ; no other fupport had he to'exped 
in the whole world. 

He was on the ground in an agony of diflreis ; his hands 
were clafped ftronglv together; and, unable to (peak, unable 
to think, he looked ftedfaflly up towards heaven, ** Oh, 
Lord! Oh, Lord I Mercy !" was all that he could utter 
how and then, fetching at the fame time xfiofl heavy iighs and 
.groans. 

But tliis ftate of anxiety did not fufFer him long to remain 
inactive. He muflered up what ftrength he had ftill remaininfi;, 
in order, if poffible, to place near his bed whatever he ihould 
moft want for refrefhment, that he might, not be entirely 
deftitute of it, in cafe the ficknefs abfolutely prevented him 
from rifing. He was barely able to carry a couple of cocoa- 
. nut fhells full of water, and place them befide his bed. He 
. next laid fome roafted potatoes there, and four lemons which 
lie had'flill remaining* and then, not able to ftir an inch far* 
ther, he fell down with wearinefs on his miferable bed> 

If it had pleafed his Maker to take him out of the-'world 
by a fudden death, how contentedly would he have yielded 
up his life ! He even prayed that it might be (b ; but very 
foon he reflected that this prayer was not reafonable. ** Am 
I not a child of God ?'* faid he to himfelf : */ Am I not Ac 
* work of his hands ? Is he not nay father, and a tender, wife, 
iind almighty father ? How have T, then, the Iboldnefs to 
' prefcribc to him what he bould do with ae i Doth he not

ItOBINSON CRUSOE. flp

towaMs thy God — whQ.dclivers from aiidiftrdnTes ! He will 
*ffift thee, he willaffifl thee, whether in life or in death I" 

After thefe words he was Ibmewhat encouraged> and raiding 
•himfelf upon his knee^^ he prayed with all the earneftneS 
^flible, laying, " I refign myfelf to thee, O iny heavenly 
Father; I refign myfelf to thy fatherly guidance ! Difpofe 
of me according to thy goqd pleafure. I will bear content! 
' cdly whatfoever thou alTottelt me ; only grant me fbehgth

grant me patience under my afAidtionSy and an ahfhaken 
confidence in thee. H ear this prayer, this only carneft prayer 
of thy poor child who is in mifery ; hear it for thy tender 
mercy's fake I" 

At the fame time he was attacked with a violeut ague. 
Though he covered himfelf all over with the dried lamat - 
&ins, yet he could not keep himfelf warm. This cold fit 
lailed full two hours, and was fucceeded by a hot fit, whidi 
was like a burning fire through all his vems. His breail, 
by the violent beating of his pulfe, heaved and funk li|ce the 
bread of a perfon'that is out of breath with running. In thit 
"terrible fitoation he had fcarce ftrength enough to lift the 
cocoa-nut fhell, with the water in it, to his mouth, that he 
might cool his burnihg jongue. 

At length a violent fwca't broke out all over his body la 
great dropsj and that afforded hini fome eafe. Wheih, at the 
end of aboiit an hour, it abated, he recovered his fpirits a 
little, and then he was diftreft widi the idea that his fife would 
go out if freih wood was hot put on. He crept^ therefore, 
weak as he was, upon sU fours, and threw as much wood 
'i^n the hearth as would be fufficient to keep in the fire un- 
til the next morning ; for night was now approaching. 

Jt was the worft night that ever he paiTed ;n his life. The 
cold and hot fit of his ague followed each other without inter- 
mif&on. He had a violent and continual pain in his head, and 
could not clofe his eyes the whole night. All this weakened 
iiim fo much, that in the morning %e was fcsft-cely able to 
craivl towards the heap of wood to risplenilh his fire. 

Towards, evening his illnefs increafcd afrefh ; he tried a- 
^ain to go. as far as the hearth, but for this time he found 



ItO T « E K E W 

bimTelf unable. He was obUged» therefore, lo give up M 
thoughts of keepu^ in his £re $ and this, in tik&, jfoon be- 
came a matter of indi&rence to him, as he now expected 
4leath to approach in a ihort time. 

This night was as reiUefs as the lafl« In the mean time 
the fire went odt ; the remainder of the^ater that was in the 
•cocoa-nut ihells be^an to fpcnU auid Robinfon was no longer 
able to turnhimfelf m his bed. He thought he felt the ap«- 
proach of death, and his joy on this account afforded him 
fufiicient fh-ength to prepare himfelf for his laft journey with 
a devout prayer. 

He again humbly afked forghrenefs of tSod for his fins, 
ancl then thanked him for all the bleiTmgs that he had vouch- 
lafed him — unworthy as he was«-^uring the whole courfe of 
his life. But, particularly^ he thanked him for the afiUdions 
which had been feat him for his amendment, and he ac- 
knowledged fincerely how wholefome they had been to him. 
. LaiUy, he prayed for the comfort and happinefs of his poor 
parents ; after which, he recommended his immortal foul to 
:the eternal mercy of his God and Father. — He then fettled 
iiimfelf, and waited for death with joyful hope. 

And, indeed, death Teemed to advance fail : his pains 
: cncr^afed, his breaH began to rattle, and his breathing be* 
came more and more difficult. Ah ! behold the wiihed-for 
moment! It feems to come at length. A oain, fuch as he 
■ had not felt before, feized his br^; he fuddenly flopped 
breathine, felt a conVulfive fhuddering, funk do^n on his 
bed, and was deprived of fenfe and motion. 

All the young company remained ftlent for a pretty long 
Ume, and by their forrow fhewed the refpedl that they bore 
lo the memory of their friend whom they had never feen— • 
*' Poor Robinibn ! ' ' cried fome of them, fighing. '^ Heavea

ROBINSON CRUSOZ. 121 



TWELFTH EVENING. 



^H A RLOTTE. Well, papa, what will you read 
as this evening ? 

Mf^ Bill. You all feem to expe£l, my dears, that I (hould 
read you foro3thing inftru6Hve and amuiing for this evening. 
What fay ye ? Shall I go oa with the adventures of Robinfon 
Crufoe ? 

Charlotte. How! why Robinfon is dead. 

Rich. Do not be in 9. hurry, Charlotte. He may have re- 
covered. Don't you remember that we thought him dead 
once before ? And yet he was alive. 

Mr. Bill. We left Robinfon, after his convullive fhudder- 
ing, fallen into a fwoon, deprived of fenfe and motion, and, 
in ihort, more d^ad than alive : neverthelefs, he came to.him* 
felf again, and recovered his fenfes and faculties. 

The Children^ Ah I that is right— we are all of us glad 
that he is not dead. 

Mr. Bill. The iirft token of his breathing again was a deep 
flgh. He opens his eyes, looks round him to know where 
he is. At that moment he doubts his being alive ; but his 
doubts are foon removed. He, then, falls into a fit of me- 
lancholy, and« in his prefent iituation, would have preferred 
death to life. 

He feels himfelf very weak, but free from all troublefome 
pain. The burning heat, which tormented him before, is 
ndw fucceeded by a kindly fweat all over his body. 1 o en- 
courage it, he covers himfelf well up with ikins, and before 
half an hour was at an end, he found himfelf coniiderably 
relieved. 

But now he was feized with a violent thirft. The water 
that remained was no longer drinkable : luckily, he thought 
of his lemons : he put one of them to his mou^, and ib 
weak was he that his teeth could fcarcely enter it ; but when 
he had fucked a little of the juice, he found himfelf greatly

agreeable flumber until funrife. 

How pleafing was the fenfe of his exiftence at prefent, 
compared with what he had felt the day before ! The vio- 
lence of his diforder was entirely abated ; nothing remain- 
ed of it but an excelHve weaknefs. He found his appetite 
return already ; he took a roafted potatoe, and fprinkled it 
with svdrop of lemon-juice^ to render it lefs inlipid and 
more refrelhing. 

For two days paft he had taken no notice of his lamas; 
they now afforded a moving light: fome of them looked at 
him, and feemed to aik if he were recovered yet. Fortu- 
nately thefe afiimalsy as well as camels, can do without 
drinking for feveral days, otherwife they would have beca 
very badly off, having never wet their lips for two days^ 
Belides, Robinfon being yet tod weak to rife and fetch them 
warer^ 4hey were likely to be deprived of it ftill for fome 
lime. , 

The oldeft of the lamas having come up clofe to him, he 
exerted the little ftrength that he had in milking her, that 
ibc might nor go dry. Her milk, no doubt, allifted Robin- 
ion's recovery ; for, after drinking it, he found himfelf 
conliderably better. 

After this, be fell afleep again, enjoyed a moft refreftiing 
(lumber, and did not awake until funfet. He perceived 
that his appetite was encreafed : he fatisfied it again with 
fome potatoes fprinkled with lemon-juice, and then went to 
ileep once more. 

This calm, uninterrupted lleep, together with his good 
conftitution, contributed fo effeftaally to the recovery of 
his ftrength, that the very next morning he was able to rife 
and attempt to walk a few Hep's, though he ftill ftaggered 
with weaknefs. 

He crawled out of his cave into the fpacc before it» 
-There he lifts up bis eyes to Hf'aven. Some beams of the 
rifing fun, piercing through the leaves of the trees that 
furrounded him, ftione agreeably on his face, and re-aoi-

Receive my gratitude^ for that thou didft ool forfake me

ROBINSON CRUSOE. ti^ 

wlicn all forfook me 5 for that thou haft reftored me to life 
afrefh, doubtlefs, in order that I may have more time to 
dfevote to repentance, and that I may not wafle a moment 
of my remaining life without forwarding that work, the on- 
ly ote thing needful^ that I may ever be found ready to take 
my flight towards the place of man's eternal deftination, where 
each fliall receive the reward of his good or bad ailions.*' 

From thefe efFuiions of gratitude towards his Creator, he 
naturally pafTed to the admi.*ation of the creatures. Hii ' 
looks wandered, fometimes, over the immenfity of heaven's 
azure vault ; fometimes, over the frelh and fmiling verdure 
of the trees and fhrubs, befprinkled with pearly dew; 
fometimes, on his lamas, which, by crowding round him, 
feemed to carefs him and excrefs their joy. He felt a plea- 
fing emotion, like that of a traveller, who, after a long abfence, 
enters, once more, the bofom of his beloved family. Hi» 
heart being moved with tendernefs, and overflowing with 
the kindeft fentiments, which fought, as it were, to expand 
themfelves, he fhed a flood of tears ; but they were tears of 
the pureft joy. 

1 he advantage of being able to take the air, and the ufe 
of milk mixed with fpring water, together with the content- 
ednefs of his mind, contributed to his perfect recovery* 
In a few days all his fbength returned, and he found him- 
felf in a capacity to begin again his former occupations. 

He went firft to examine liis new-made earthen ware, and 
to fee how it had fucceeded: As fo6n as he opened the oven, 
what an agreeable furprife I All his veflTels were as well gla- 
zed, as if they had been the work of an experiencedfpotter. 
In the height of his joy for this fuccefs, he does hot perceive 
that his war^ is of no ufe to him ; he forgets that his fire it 
o»t. When, at length, he recoliedled this circumftance, he 
flood motionlefs for a while, and, hanging his head, fixed 
his eyes, fometimes on his pots, fometimes on his fire-place, 
and ended with heaving a deep figh. 

Neverthclefs, he was able this time to moderate his vexa- ' 
tion, and to contain it within due bounds. "The fame good 
Ptovidence;*' faid he to himfelf, " which before provided you 
with fire, has always more than one way at hand to provide 
yoa with it again, ami you will not be deprived of it,' if 
Heaven thinks fit." Befides, he was already taught that hf 
had not the rigors of winter to fear ; and though he was t.c- 
cMomed, fronir his childhood, to live chie&y on vae^x, ^qx V^

hoped to be able, and not inconveniently, to do without it, 
and live upon fruits and the milk of his lamas. 

Charlotte, Why, he might have ufed his fmoked meat for 
^duals ; there would have been no neceffity for drefling it. 

Mr. Bill. That is true ; but how was he to have fmok- 
ed meat ? 

Charlotte. Oh ! I forgot that. 

Mr Bill. After all, he was not ibrry that he had made 
the pots and pans : they were convenient to hold his milk, 
and the largeft he intended for a very particular ufe. 

Rich, What was that ? 

Mr, Bill. He thought, if his potatoes were accompanied 
with butter, he Ihould relifli them better than without. 

Rich. I fuppofe fo. 

Mr. Bill. >4ot being able to make a churn of wood, he 
had a mind to try whetlier he could not churn butter in a large 
earthen pot. He gathered, therefore, as much cream as 
he thought would be fuificient. He Ihaped out alfo a round 
flat piece of wood, in the centre of which he made a hole 
to receive a ftick. This inllrument he held upright in the 
cream pot, and moved it with an incefTant motion up and 
down, up and down, until the butter was, at length, fepara- 
ted from the butter-milk. He then walhed the butter ia cleatt 
fpring water, and made it up with a little fait. 

He was now, once more, happy in the accomplifhment of 
his defign ; but, at the very moment when he was going to 
reap the fruits of his induftry and perfeverance, he rccollcd- 
ed that he muil think no more of potatoes, for want of fire 
to roaft them ; a circumftancc which, vo, the warmth of exe- 
cuting his defign, he had never once thought of. He has but- 
ter, but he can make no ufe of it ; he looks at it, he wUhes 
for it, he puts it from him, he grows forrowful. Difappoint-^ 
ed in his hopes, he finds himfelf juil as he was at firft, m dan- 
ger of wanang every thing. It is true, the oyfters, the milk, 
the cocoa-nuts, and flefti, either raw or dried in the fun, 
might afford him nourifiiment ; but was it certain that no ac- 
cident would deprive him of thefe refources ? fivA the moft de- 
plorable of all was, that he could invent no means to render 
his unhappy lot better or more fecure. 

What (hall he underuke now ? Whatever his hands, 

without the help of tools, were capable of performing, heha« 

already executed ; and it feemsnow ai if he had nothing left 

to do but to pafs Uic remainder of his life in idlends and 

fleep.

iccp. Dreadful dcftiny ! He caimot bear the thonght of 
it. He was now become fo accnilomed to work, that he 
could not live without employing his time in fome ufeful oc*- 
cupation. Jn the latter part of his life, he would often fay, 
that his reformation was principally owing to this fingle cir- 
cumftance, that he was tonilrained, when in folitude, and 
deprived of all affiftance, to provide for his wants himfelf by 
perfevering labour ; and he would add, •* Confbmt employ- 
ment is the mother of a trowd of virtues, as habitual idlenefs' 
in the fource of all vice." 

Rick. He was very right ; when one has nothing to do,^ 
one thinks of nothing but rolUes and nonfenfe. 

Mr, Rill. It is even fo ; and, therefore, young perfons 
are advifed to accuftom themfelves early to employment. 
The charaftcr that we chiefly put on when we are young, as 
idlenefs or induftry, a6Hvity or flownefs, virtute or wickednefs, 
generally remains with us all our lives. 

Edw. We fhould apply tl\at to ourfelves. 

Mr. Bill. Do fO| my dear children, and condu6^ your- 
felves accordingly : you will never repent it. Our unfortunate 
Robinfon turned and turned again on every fide, to try what 
he might- undertake in order to avoid idlenefs. At length 
he found an employment. Can you guefs what it was ? 

Rici^. Were I in his place, '1 know what I would have 
done* 

Mr. Bill. Ay ! Let us hear your plan. 

Ricin I would have undertaken to tan the lama (kins, that 
their ftiffhefs might not hurt me when I put them on. Be- 
€des, the hair mail be vexy inconvenient in a country where 
the heat is fo exceffive. 

Mr. Bill. How would you have fet abcftt it ? 

Rich. Oh ! 1 know very well how the tanners do. We 
have been more than once to fee them at work. 

Mr Bill. Well. 

Rich. Firft they put the raw hides in water, and let them 
fteep there for fome davs ; from thence they carry them to 
the leg, on which they (crape them, to force out the water 
with which they are foaked. After fprinkling them with fait, 
they cover them up carefully to keep the air from them. This 
they czll/wiating the ikins. In fad, they do fweat whilft ia

they put the (kins Into what is called the tan, cdmpofed •f

oak baj^. Laftly, they place them in the tan vat, where they 
fprinkle them with a liquor made alfo of oak bark> and from 
hence they take them out to curty or drefs them ; in a word, 
to put the finiihing hand to them. < 

Mr. Bill. Very well, my little friend ; but do you know 
for what ufe fkins thus prepared by the tanners are intended? 

Rich, Oh ! yes : they are made into Ihoes, boots, coach- 
harnefs, and many other things. 

Mr. Bill, Other things which do not require fo foft and 
pliable a leather as that, for iolUnce, of which gloves are 
made. 

Rich. Oh! no. 

Mr. Bill. Who is it, then, that prepares this fort of leather? 

Kicb, The fkinner or fellmonger ; but we have never been 
in the workihop of any who follow that bufmefs. 

Mr, Bill, Robinfon was nearly in the fame predicament. 
He had never been in the workfhop either of tanner or fell- 
monger, confequently he could not endeavour to imitate, ei- 
ther of them. 

Ediv. Then how does the fellmonger manage his fkins ? 

Mr. Bill. He begins like the tanner, with this difference, 

that he does not fleep the fkins either in tan or in lime, (for 

this is alfo ufed by the tanners,) but he makes ufe of warm 

water, with bran and leaven, and afterwards a lee of afhes : 

. —but we will go fome day and fee them, at work. 

Rtcb. If he had known the bufinefs even as well as any 
fkinner, he could not have attempted to drefs fkins for want 
of bran and leaven. 

Mr. Bill That is clear ; fo that he was obliged to give up 
all thoughts of it. 

FJ^w . But how, then, did he intend to employ himfelf ? 

Mr, Bill, His thoughts were employed night and diy 
alout building a liulc boat. 

Ricb, What ufe did he intend to make of it ? 

Mr, Bill, Do you afk what ufe ? To try, by means of it, 
to return among ft his fellow-creatures, and to deliver himfelf 
from the folitude to which he was confined againft his will, 
and which was become more difmal to him ever fince he was 
deprived of fire. He hadreafon to think that the continent of 
America was not far off; and he was determined, if he had

if poffible> on this continent. Full of this idea, he hailened 
out one day to feek and make choice of a tree, which he 
anight convert into a boat, by hollowing out 'the trunk of it,. 
.With this defign he traverfed feveral parts of the ifland whei^ 
he had never been before, and remarked, in his way, eveml 
plants that were unknown to him, aipd on which he relblved ta 
make experiments, to find whether they would anfwer the 
purpofe of food. • Amongft others, he obferved fome flalks of 
anaize, or Indian corn, as it is called: 
. Eii'w. What, that fort of corn of which you have two fine 
cars hanging up in the back parlour ? 

Mr, Bill, ^he fame. He admired the largenels gf the 
heads, or, more properly fpcaking, the ears; on each of which 
he reckoned more than two hundred large grains, clofel/ 
ranged, one befide the other^ and refembling grains of coral. 
JHe had not the leail doubt but this com might be ufed for 
food, or even for bread* But how was it to be ground ? How 
was the flour to be feparated from the bran ? How was it 
jto be made into bread, or, indeed,, into food of any fort^ 
without the help of fire ? Not withflan ding all thefe confide- 
radons, he carried oS fome ears of it with him, intending t6i>- 
fow the grains. _** How do I know,** faid he, •* but 1 may 
reap confiderable advantage from thefe in the end ?** 
. A little further on he difcovcred a fruit tree of a foecies- 
quite new to him. From this tree hung vail numbers oflarge 
huiks, one of which he opened, and lound in it abopt iixty 
/luts of a particular fort. Though they were not "very a- 
^reeable to the tafte, yet he put one or two of the ripeft huT/cs^ 
into his pouch. 
. Rich, But what fruit might that be I 

Mr. Bili. They were cicao-nuts, of which they makr 
chocolate* 

EdiAj, Ah I now he may have chocolate for the future. : 

Mr, Bill. Not fo fall. In the fir ft place, he does not know 
that he has chocokte-nuts in his pofTefiion : befides, diefe nut^ 
ihould be roafted,. then bruifed, and ground up with'fugar^ 
and, we all know, he was as litde provided with fogar a& 
with fire. . In order to improve the flavour of the chocolate^ 
they commonly add different forts of fpices,. as cardamum^ 
▼amUa, and cloves ; but thefe were unneceflary niceties ta 
be deprived of, which gave him not the leail concern in com- 
parifoo with the want of fac. 

At length he came to another tree> which was as little ~

I2t T H E W 1 W • 

knovm to lum as the fbmef . The fndt of it was as lam 
aa that of the cocoa-nat treCf bat had neidicr hdLnor iheU x 
Ithe whole was eatable and of an exqoifite flavour. This tree 
Was alio quite difierently (haped mm the cocoa-nut tree. 
It did not confiHt like the latter^ of a trunk wluch rifes 
Araight up its whole height, and bears a topping of thick 
foliage'; but this had branches and leaves^, like thofe of our 
firuit trees. He learned afterwards that it was the bread-tree, 
to called becaufe its fruit fenres the natives for bread, fome> 
timesjuft as it grows, but more conunonly pounded and 
4BQiade into a fort of doufi;h* 

He obferved,. that ue trunk of this tree, from its great 
age> was already a little hollowed on one fide ; and imme- 
mattly he thought it would anfwer for the boat that he had 
in Gontempla(!ion« if he could only find means to cutitdowii 
and hollow it fuffidently. But tihen to cut down fo ufeful ja 
tree, while, on the other hand, it was uncertain whether ht 
ihould ever be able to make a canoe of it I— »this thought 
' |butled him. After weighmg every thing for and againfl it, 
in his own mind, for a long time, he. carefully marked the 
^t, that he might find it again, and went away without de« 
tennining upon any thmg. 

In his walk he found, what he had long wifhed for, a jpai% 
rot's nefl. The difcovery gave him a great deal of plealure* 
He went towards it without the leaft noife, and was firetch* 
ing out his hands to clap them on the neft, when the young 
parrots, which were firong and well fledged, took to flight, 
and efcaped from him all but one, more flow than the reft, 
which could not get away, and remained his prifoner. He 
haflened, therefore, home to his habitation, more pleafed 
than if he liad found a treafure. 

Edw, But what great advantage did he exped from a 
parrot? 

Mr. BilL He hoped to teach him to pronounce fome wor4s* 
Shat he might have the fatisfadion of hearing a voice whidi 
Imitated that of man. As to us who live in fociety, who 
enjoy the happinefs of feeing men every day, and hearing 
^m, and converfin^ with them, we, perhaps, may look 
upon it as a very trifling and childifli fadsfadion which Ko-

130 THE N E ^ 

Kichard (hall {peak firft> and tell as why he is for hviog 
'Ihe tree. 

Jihh, Becaufe it bears a valuable fruit, and the fpedes 1$ 
rare upon the ifland, 

EJiv. h is but an old tree ; the advantage of gathering 
fruit from it will not laft long. 

Rich, How can you tell tkat / It has but a flight hollow 
in it as yet ^ and how many trees do we fee, the trunks of 
which, though hollow, do not hinder them from bearing fruit 
for many years ? 

Harriet, Let Robinfon only graft a few flips of this tree, 
lie will be fure to preferve the fpecies. 

Geo. Ay ! Do tney grow up and bear fruit fo foon? Foof 
or £ve years may very well pais before he has any fruit. 

Henry, And is it not better to have a canoe, and return 
to the focietv of men, than to ftay in his ifland, though he 
were to feed ever fo plentifully upon the bread made of the 
fruit of this tree? 

Rich. Why, ay, if the canoe could be finiflied fo very 
fbon. But how is he to cut down this tree ? How is he to 
fcollow it out, with nothing but a ftone hatchet ? 

£^u. Let him work with perfeverance : let hin^ not be 
impatient : I dare fay he will accomplifli it at laft. 

Geo. But he has no (ail. What voyage can he onderuke 
in an open boat ? 

Harriet, He may ufe oars, 
r Charlotte. A pretty notion indeed ! Do not you remember, 
when we were m a boat down the river, near Putney, and 
<me of the watermen's oars broke, he was obliged to go 
aihore and borrow another, as he faid we could not be rowed 
Iiome with only one ? 

Ed<w, Oh ! that was a large boat, and there were nine or 
ten of us in it. But Robinfon, in his little fkiff*, wants no- 
thing but a pair of oars to euide himfelf happily far away 
from his prelent folitary habuation. 

Mr. Bill, You fee, my dear children, the queftion is not 
lb taSy to refolve. None of the reafons that you have men« 
tioned on both iides had efca^ Robinfon's attention. He 
]iad paiTed the whole night in refleding^ ; for to examine 
whether it be more convenient to doa tfing, or not to do it» 
ifl called r^Sng.^ Ever fince Robinfon had felt the bitter 
confequences of ms hafty refolution to tmvel, he had made it

flutarely refleding upon it ; aad ia tht prefent ctfe^. alfb^ 
he determines to obferve tkat law. Having turned the 
qneftion and examined it m every point of yiew, he fotmd 
it came to no more than this : Whether it be reafonable to 
facrifice a flighty but certain advantage, to a great one, bat 
oncertaiii ? Here he recollected the rable of a doe» which^ 
fwimming acroisa river with a piece of meat in his m'ondi^ 
loft it by endeavoming to fnatch at dierefiedtion of it'in the 
water. He remembmd^ 00 the other faand». the cnftom oT 
knfbandmen, who facriiice grain which diey might/make 
nfe of> but do it with the h^ of being richly repaid 1^ a. 
.^entiful harveft. 

*• Yes," faid he to himfelf^ ** the do^*5 ereedinefs was 
folly ; he catched at a vain (hadow, whkh it was impofv 
lible for him to pofTefs. But the hope of the hufbandman^ 
on the other hand, is well founded^ and his condudlfenfible ; 
he has in view a real advantage, though, it is tf\ie> fome ac» 
cidents may hinder him from obtaining it. 

** Am I not, therefore, in the fituation of the farmer^ 
•With perfevering labour, may I not hope to fucceed, at 
length, in making a canoe out of this old tree f And if my 
firft undertaking lucceeds, does reafon forbid me to exped^ 
that I may efcape from this folitary ifland, and arrive, by 
means of my canoe, at fome place inhabited by men ?** 

This thought, fo flattering to his warmed wiihes, made a 
lively impreffion on him ; fo that he ftarted up that moment,. 
took his hatchet, ran to the tree, and cut into it. 

If ever he undertook a long and troublefonre tafk, it was 
certainly this. A thoufand other men would have been dif- 
couraged; the hatchet would have fallen out of their hands after 
the firft ftrokej they would have. looked upon the undertaking, 
if not extravagant, at I^eafl as impoffible. ' But we have feen 
already, that Robinfon made it a rule never to fuffer himfelf 
to be turned from his purpofe when he had well confidered 
ir^; he was, therefore, unfhaken in his refolution of going 
through with this enterprize. Were it to coft him twice 
the time and fatigue that it required, yet the thouglit of 
giving it up would never enter his head. From the fbn's 
riiing till about noon he never ccafed working, and then 
his hand would have covered or filled up the hole that he 
had made in the trunk by the thonfatids of ftroke?. wlikh h^ 
laid on it; Fnom tUs we may -form fome idea how long a

time It will require Kiin to cut down a tree of fuch a tbkk- 
XijcfSf and to make a boat of it. 

Being convinced that it would be a work of fome years^ 
lie thought proper to regulate his occupations, and divide 
Jbis time, fo that each part of the day might have its own 
work allotted to itfelf. Experience had taught him, that, 
in a life of labour, nothing helps induflry fo much as regu- 
larity, and a methodical diHribution of the work to the dif- 
/erent hours of the day. I will give you an account of the 
divifioQthat he made of his time and his occupations, each 
of which had its peculiar portion of the day to itfelf. He 
Tofe at break of day, and went direftly to the fpring, where 
he walhed his head, hands, breaft, and feet. Having no linea 
to wipe himfelf dry, he let the air dry his body, and af- 
filed it by running, as he generally did, ftraight home to finifh 
dreiCng himfelf. He then went up to the top of the hillock 
at the foot of which his cave was fituated. His fight being 
then hindered by no objed, he traverfed, at one view, aU 
the beauties of nature that were comprifed in this vail hori-* 
S5on. The fight elevated his foul. In the poilure, there- 
fore, which he thought mod refpe^lful, and in the Sincerity 
of his heart, he worfhipped and prayed to the Author of all 
Things ; and never failed particularly to entreat that he 
would make his parents happy, whom, though he had for- 
iaken, he never forgot. He then returned to his cave, and 
milked his lamas, which were now encreafed in number to 
a little flock. He breakfafled on fome of the new milk, 
and the reft he put up in his cellar. Thefe were the cares^ 
that employed the firft hour of the day. 

Now, being provided with whatever was neceifary to his 
fecurity or his convenience in working, he went down, if it 
was low water, to the fea fide, where he gathered what 
t)yfters he could find for his dinner ; if not> he repaired im- 
mediately to the tree of which he intended to make acanoc. 
Bis lamas generally followed him> and grazed about while 
^ was at work. 

About ten o'clock the heat was^enerally fa excefiive that 
he was obligedtoquit his work. iG then went to the fea-fide 
to look for oyfters, if he had not found any . in the mornings 
and at the fame time to bathe, which he did regularly, twice 
*a day. Before noon he returned home with his flock.

of cheeC; from the milk which had curdled^ and then laid out 
his dimier, which, being tolerably frugal, was foon done. 
It confifted of new cheefe dipped in milk^ feme cyders^ and 
half a cocoa-nut. There was one circumftance of which 
he had no reafon to complain, and that \ias, that he had not 
by half fo great an appetite in this hot country as people 
generally have in cold climates ; yet, as he uas accuftomed 
m>m his childhood to eating meat> he longed for it, and^ in 
order to fatisfy his wifh as far as was poilible, had recourfe 
to his fcheme of drying it in the fun. At dinner time^ he . 
amufed himfelf with his parrot ; he (poke to it, and fre-^ 
quently repeated certain words, with the hope of hearing it 
pronounce fome of them one day or another. 

Henry, What did he feed it with ? 

Mr, Bill, Parrotf, when they are wild, generally keA 
upon cocoa-nuts, acorns, the feed of gourds, and other fuch 
matters.; when tame, they are fed with whatever is fit for a 
man to eat : fo that Robinfon was very well able to keep his 
wrh cheefe and cocoa-nuts. 

^ After dinner, he commonly repofed himfelf, for an hour, 
cither under the (hade in the open air, or elfe in his cave" fur- 
rounded by his lamas, and with his parrot at his fide. Sonrie- 
times, as he fat, he would fix his eyes upon thefe animnls^ 
^d fpeak to them (like a child that fpeakstoits doll), as ^ 
if he expeded them to underftand what he faid. So necef-- 
iary did he find it to communicate his ideas and his fenti- 
ments to living creatures, that he ofcen forgot the impofli- 
bility of his being underftood by the animals which fur-' 
rounded him. When his parrot, which he called Poll, repeat- 
ed a word diftindlly, in ffae height of his joy he would ima- 
gine that he had heard the voice of a man. He forgot ifland, 
lamas, parrot, and all ; his fancy made him fuppofe him- 
felf in the midfl of human creatures again. But foon reco- 
vering from this pleafing illufion, and finding himfelf in n 
, difmal folitude, he would figh heavily, and breathe forth this 
Ihort exprsffion of complaint, " Poor Robinfon !"— About 
two o'clock— — 

Eihv, How could he always tell what hour it was ? 
, Mr. BilL He did as hudlbanamen fbmetimesdn; heobfer^ 
ved the height of the fun, and judged from thence that it was 
fach or fuch an hour nearly. — About tv\o o'clock he re* 
turned to the tree to work at tus grand defign. He conti- 
Auedtwohourseach time at this laborious. tafk| andthea

retorned to the beach to bathe himfelf again, and toother 
inore pyilers. The reft of the day he fpent in working at 
Ins garden. Sometimes he fowed maize, or planted potatoes, 
hoping that, if he fhould ever have fire again, they might 
both be of great advantage to him. Sometimes he grafted 
fiom the bread- tree ; fometimes he watered the youfig grafts ; 
fbmetimes he would plant a quickfet hedge to enclofe his ear- 
den ; femetimes he cropped the willows which furrounded the 
ipace before his caVe ; he bent and fixed their branches in fuch a 
manner, that as they grew they might form.a kind of bower. 

Much to Robinfon's grief, the longefl day was, in his ifland» 
bat thirteen hours. In the middle of fummer it was night at 
feven o'clock. Whatever required daylight for the perform* 
ance of it, mnfl be finifhed before that time. Therefore, as 
night drew on, that is to fay, about fix o'clock, if he had no 
other more important bufinefs upon his hands, he went through 
his exercife. 
Jticb. What does that mean, papa ? 
Mr. Bill. It means that he exercifed himfelf at fhooting 
mth the bow, and throwing the ^ar , that he might be able 
to defend himfelf if lie fhould happen to meet with a favage 
or a ^d beafl ; for he was never perfedly free fh)m the dread 
of thefe. By degrees he acquired fuch great dexterity in 
both the exercifes above mentioned, that he feldom miff- 
ed a mark of the £ze of a crown, though at a pretty good 
diftance from him. When m|;h^ came on« he went home to 
jnilk his lamas for the third tune, and took a moderate fup« 
per by the light of the moon or ftars. 
. LaiUy,. he crowned the labours of the day by meditating 
at night upon his own conduA. Sometimes he went to fit 
vpon the top of the hillock, from whence he could behold the 
fJcKtrj vault of heaven at one view, and contemplate- it with 
admiration. Sometimes, alfo,. he took a walk upon the fea- 
fide, to breathe the air frefhehed by the evening breeze . Then 
lie would afk himfdf— '• How have yon fpent the day ?

Whenever to thefe or the like quelHons his confdenoe could 
return a good anfwer, and telHfy that the ftate of his foul was 
comfortable, he fung a hymn to the praife of tlie Supreme Be- 
ing who had affifted him in advancing one ftep in the road to 
virtue. When, on tlie contrary, he had reaion to be not fo 
well pleafed with hi^elf, the thoughts of having thus loft a 
day filled him with forrow ; for he counted tlie day loft when 
he had thouglit or done any thing which he could not apyrove 
at night. Whenever this was the cafe, then clofe by the notch 
that he made every day upon the tree which ferved him by 
wav of almanack, he made two notches croffing each other ; 
ana this ferved to put him in mi^ of his feult, that for the fa* 
tore he might be better on Ids guard, and not fall into the lame 
error. 

Thus, my dear children, Robinibn laboured to corred him- 
felf and to become better every day. Do you alfo fmcerely 
rcfolve to form your hearts to virtue ? I advife you to follow 
the example diat he now gives you. Like him, referve an 
liour privatelv every evening, to give an account to yourfelves 
in filence of the manner in which you have fpent the day ; andf 
if you find, either in your thoughts, words, or a^ons, any thing 
which your confciences dare not ^vow, keep a book wherein 
^ou may mark down the fame, to put you in mind of it from 
time to time, that, having hcfqre your eyes the fault of whidh 
you have once been guilty, you may ever afterwards take more 
care to avoid it. By thus labouring to improve yourfelvea 
everyday, you will alfo continpally encreafe your own fatis* 
ia£tion and happinefs. 

My dear children, I doubt not that you will afford me every 
proof of your attention and docility, and this very night begin 
to put in practice the good advice which I have juft now given 
you.

FOURTEENTH BVENINCf. 



Kf^' BILL. Yeilerday I gave you the particulars of Ro-. 
binfoa's manner of living. Three years pafled away, 
and it was ftill the fame. In all tha: time, and mth fucb 
perfevering conilancy in labour, how fav do ye think was he 
advanced in the making of his canoe ? Alas ! he had fcarcely 
cut through half the trunk of the tree, and it now feemed a 
matter of doubt to hira whether he could cut dsown the tree 
in Icfs^than three or four years more, though kewcre to wx^k 
with the fame conftant regularity as before. 

In the mean time he never Cackened the work. What effe, 
indeed, could he have undertaken? And, then, he was neither 
willing nor able to remain idle. One day the thoup^ht ftruclc 
!iim, that as long as he had lived in this id and, he had feen 
but a very fmall part of it. He was angry with himfelf for 
his own weaknefs, when he refledled that fear was the caufc 
which had prevented him fiom traverfing the whole of it. 
•• Perhaps," faid he, " had I been lefs afraid, I might have 
difcovered many things which would ^t prefent be very ufe- 
fultome." 

This coniideration determined him to fet out the very next 
.morning by day -break in order to take a view of the whole 
ifiand. 

Eii<w* How large might this ifland be ? 

Mr. Bill, Perhaps much about the extent of the county 
of Middlefex. The fame day he made every requifite pre- 
paration for his departure ; and the next morning, having 
loaded one of his lamas with prcvifions for four days, having 
armed and accoutred himfelf, and prayed for the divine pro- 
teftion,he fet cut on his journey with confidence. His deiign 
was to keep as much as poflible to the fea-fide, and to avoid 
forefls, that he might be lefs liable to meet with wild beafts. 

His firll day's journey was remarkable for no extraordinary 

accident. He travelled about twenty miles. The farther 

he went the plainer he could perceive that the fituation of his 

(dwelling-place was in the barreneft part of the ifland. In 

i^^MB^^ pasu hfi fi)i]a4 tttti, fuch as he had never feen before,

which appeared to bear fruits capable of furniftling him with 
a nourifhment as wholefome as it was agreeable. It was not 
until fomc time after that he knew the uiefokefs of them, and 
learned their names. 

Amongft thefe trees was one called the paper mulberry- 
tree, the bark of which is wrought into a fine fort of paper 
by the people of Japan, and makes a handfome fummer ftuff 
for the inhabitants of Otaheite. I will Ihew you a piece of 
it, which I received as a prelent from a gentleman who had 
been with Captain Cook, Robinfon ilept ihe^firll n^ght in a 
tree, that he might be the more fecure from wild bealts, and 
at the firfi dawn of day he fet out again. 

He had not travelled far before he found himfelf at the 
Southern extremity of the illand. In fome places the foil was 
fandy. He had a mind to walk out upon a neck of land 
whidi extended pretty far into the fea, but fuddenly ilarting 
back,»he grew as pale as death. He looked round him all in a 
tremble, and then, hanging his head, itood ftock.ftill and in- 
capable of motion, asifne had been Itruck by a tnunderbolt. 

Rh'/j, What was the matter with him ? 

Mr, Sill. His tyes difcovered what he never expefted to 
find there, the tracks of men's feet imprinted in the faiid. 

£</w. What ! does that frighten him ? 1 thmk he Ihould 
-rejoice at the fight, 

Mr. BilL I will explain to you the rcafon of his fright. 
Upon his firft beholding thefe tracks, he did not reprefent to 
himfelf the men, whofe fleps had left the impreflions he faw, 
as civilized, humane, companionate beings, ever ready to 
affift their fellow creatures according to their power ; but he 
imagined them to be barbarous, cruel, ferocious, ready, if 
they met him, to fall upon him, to kill him, and to devour 
him : in a word, he did not fuppofe that civilized Europeans 
had boen upon die fpot, but favages and cannibals ; that is, 
as I before explained it to you, and which you could not hear 
without being (hocked, men whofe horrible cuftom it was to 
feed upon human flelh. 

Rich. That idea is enough, indeed, to fhock one. 

Mr. BilL It would have been better for Robinfon, h^d he 
been accuftomcd from his childhood not to give way to the 
impulfe of terror, even in the greateft dangers, and had he, 
ac this moment, preferved more coolneis and prefence of 
jnixuL We can ail bring ourfelves to it, if we will but pa/ 



IjS THE NEW 

an early and conftant attention to the rendering of our bodies j 
as well as our minds, found and vigorous. 

Rich. But I do not rightly underfland how we can bring 
ourfelves to this temper. 

Mr. BilL By fortifying our bodies withfobriety, regularity, 
and exercife, conformably to the intent of nature, and by 
preferring our minds free from blemilh, by a fteady an^ 
enlightened piety. Thus fortified, we fhall be able^to bear 
every change of fortune, and look upon danger with an eye 
of indifference. Thus, my dear children, if you will always 
temperately confine yourfelves to thofe forts of food which 
are by fo much the more wholefome as they are more plaia 
and natural than others, and prepared with lefs luxurious 
nicety ; if you will abftain more and more every day from 
delicacies, thofe poifons in difguife, as pernicious to the 
health as they are agreeable to the tafte ; if you will avoid 
idlenefs, which Is equally deilrudive to the body as the foal; 
if, as far as lies in your power, you will accuilom your minds 
to a habit of attention and refiedtion, and fbengthen your 
bodies with a degree of exercife that inures you to motion 
without exhaujding you ; if fometimesy on purpofe, and of 
your own free choice, you will abftain from a thing which 
would be very agreeable to you, which you even deure, and 
which it is perfedlly in your own power to^rocure yourfelves; 
if, upon other occafions, you contentedly bear with things 
that feem difagreeable, though you could avoid doing fo* ; 
if, farther, you contract the habit of not having recourfe to 
others, but, on the contrary, of finding in yourfelves a rc- 
fource for all your wants, thus, as far as lies in your power, 
doing without the adiflance of odier hands, and ufingyour own 
judgments in order to receive from your own faculties advice 
and afiiflance in every trouble and difficulty ; if« laflly, yoa 
labour with care to acquire and preferve to yourfelves the 
precious treafure of a confcience free from reproach, which 
afiures you of the proteftion and favour of the Almighty : 
then, my dear children, you will gain, and you will feel your- 
felves poffefifed of, all the ftrengm of body and mind that you 
are capable of poifeffing* The moft whimiical and mQ&. un- 
deferved changes of fortune will not trouble nor difcompofe

ROBINSON CItUS<5E. I^^ 

Mthing can poffibly kappen which will not turn to yoiv 
greateft advantage. 

Robbfon, as you fee, had not yet reached, by his pro?rds 
in true piety, that degree of fortitude fo neceffary to his hap- 
innefs and repofe. This may be imputed to the life which 
he had led for fome years,, fo tranquil and fo unexpofed to 
dangers. In a date of conflant tranquillity, (mark well this 
truth, my dear children,) in a fituation of perfsft fecurity, 
man never acquires all the energy nor all the courage of 
which his mind is fufceptible. Does it fo happen that he is 
fuddenly placed in circumftances imufual and terrifying? 
He is weak, timid, and overpowered with terror. Nay, too 
mndi cafe fometimes ferves no other pufpofe than to render 
ft man vicious. We ought, therefore, to rieceive as bkjQing* 
thofe trials which Heaven fends us from time to time, be the/ 
ever fo fevere, fince they are the means of knowing, of exer«i> 
cifing, and ftrengthening our courage by experience. 

You remember into what a confternation the unexpefted 
fight of fome tracks of men's feet threw the poor affrighted 
Robinfon. He looks round to every quarter ; at the noife 
of every leaf he feels frefh terror. In the confuiion of hit 
fpirits, he knows not what to refolve on : at laft, muttering 
up all his fb-ength, he takes to flight, wiih the utmofl precipU 
tation, like a man who is purfued ; and fo great is his terror^ 
that he dares not, even once, looktback. But fuddenly he 
Hops ; his fear is changed into horror. What an objed ftnkes 
his eye ! Ah ! my dear children, prepare yourfelves for the 
mofl (hoddng (peftade in nature ; the horrible confequencet 
of man's depraved ilate when totally abandoned to himfelf^ 
and deprived of all education, lie faw a round hole, in th^ 
middle of which was a fpace whereon a fire feemed to hav^ 
been kindled, though it was then out. All round this hole. 

' 1 fiiudder while I relate it -he perceived hands and 

feet, fcuUs, and other human bones, fcattered about, which 
prefented the horrible remains of an unnatural feafl, where 
A human body had been devoured. 

The Children, How (hocking ! What, by men ? 

Mr, Bill, Can they be called men ? They have only the 
outfide ^ men: without education, degraded, rendered 
brutal, and like the molt ravenous animals, neither the . 
loathing which fuch an adion would naturally produce, nor 
the companionate feelings of humanity, prevent them from 
fpik^nng the abominable cuftomof murdering thek- fellow^

ipreacures to feed on them. Thefe were their prifoners of 
war> on whom, after they had killed and roailed thern^ 
they made .a horrible feaft, in which their iavage joy mani- 
feiled itfelf by dances and fongs, or gather the howiings o£ 
gorged cannibals^ 

Charlotte, Oh 1 the deteftable creatures i 

Mr\ Bill. Let us, my dear Charlotte, deteft theiF atro- 
cious manners* and not- their perfons : they have received 
po education^ no inltrudioa. Jf you had been fo unfortu- 
nate as to have received your birth amongfl thefe favage 
people, you would, like them, run about naked in the 
woods, without the kail fhame, flupid and fierce as a brute 
l)eaft : you would paint your body and your face with va^ 
jious colours^ particularly red : you would make holes in 
your nofe and earsi^ and be very proud to carry in them» 
ibr ornament, birds . feathers^ fea ihells, and other trifles : 
you would, then, make one at the abominable fealls of 
your depraved reiationa, and there take your (hare with as 
much pleafure as you do now at our beft dinners. Rejoice, 
therefore, all of you, and blefs God that you.belonjg to 
parents who were born and bred up in polifhed fociety^ 
iwhere they have learned, from their mfancy, to be humane^ 
civil, polite, and f^endly, and not to negledt any thi^g 
that weay render you alfo mild, agreeable, compafiionate^ 
and fufceptible of twtia virtue. Pity the unhappy lot of 
thofe men, who, being left to themfelves. Hill lead a favage 
life like that of wild beails in the woods. 

Henry, And are there any fuch ftill ? 

Rich, Far off, very far dff from hence, in an ifland call- 
ed New Zealand. Papa read us fomething' about it laft 
indnter in Captain Cook's Voyap;es. The natives of that 
ifland eat human flefh ; but, it is to be hoped, their inter- 
cdurfe with our people will, by degrees, bring them to 
leave off fo barbarous a cuAom. 

Henry, That would be well done. 

Mr, Bill, Robinfon turned his eyes away from the hideoiu 
fpedtacle ; it made him quite fick, and he would, in all likeli- 
hood, have fainted, if nature had not relieved herfelf, by^for- 
cing him to throw i^ whatever was upon his ilomach. As ibon 
as he was a little recovered, he fled awav again with fo much 
precipitation^at his lama could fcarcely Iceep up with him;fbf 
this faithful animal followed dofe at his heels wherever he 
m^M. fear had (6 taken poifeifion of Rohiafon'j faciikief, 

that 



It O B i K S O Kf C KV t Ot. I4 1 

tSSt he quite forgot his lama, and> hearing its ftepsclofeb^r 
him 9 as ke ran, hM. not the leaft doubt but there was a cannibal 
behind in clofe purfuit of him. Filled with this notion, he 
fied with redoubled ipeed, to efcape from the imaginary favage 
fit his heels> and, in order to be lefs encumbered and lighter in 
his flight, he threw away his fpear, his bow, his arrows, and 
his hatchet. This might have been the moment to make ufe 
6f them, but he never once thought of doing fo; in flight a- 
loae he placed all his dependence. But, in his flight, he for- 
gets whither he is running; he regards not which way he takesi 
the opened ground is that which he prefers, let it lead him 
where it will. Thus, after he had run for near an hour, it 
iiappened th^t he made a circuit, which brought hun back tt> 
the very (pot from whence he had fet out. 

Here was new terror ! new perplexity ! JEIe forgot the place j 
ie had no idea that it was the fame which he had feen before ; 
lie takes it for»a fecond proofof the horrible cruelty, the fight 
of which he was endeavouring to avoid. He turns away, there- 
ibre, from the fpot, and continues his flight as long as he ha9 
fh-ength to carry him. At length, quite exhaufled, he falk 
down without fenfe or motion. Here his lama> having over* 
takeft him, lies down beflde him, fpent witli fadgue. By mer« 
chance it was the very fpot where Robihfon had thrown away 
his 2Lrms ; and thefe were the firii: objeds that ftr uck his eyes 
the moment he opened them. Seeing his arms fcattered kbouc 
iOn the grafs, he imagined himfelf in a dream, and that wHat- 
iBver had pafTed was no more. He could not conceive by what 
means they were conveyed there, nor how he came there him- 
felf ; fo jnuch had his fright diibubed all the Acuities of his 
ciind. 

He rofe now to leave the plate, btit his confuflon bein* 
fomewhat abated, he was not fo imprudent as to forget h^ 
■ arms; he gathered them up, and firmly refolved to part 
no more with the only means of his defence. He was fa 
weakened, that it was impoffible for him now to make fo much 
liaftc as before, though equally urged by fear. He had no 
^^ appetite for the remainder of the day, and he never flopped but 
once« which was only for a moment, at a fpring to quench hi# 
thirft. 

He hoped to be able to get home that fame day> but found 
it impoffible. At night^faU he was within a couple of niles of 
his own dwelling, at a place which he called his country feat. 
. It wai a j>retQr large endofure, whichhe had chofei u a kind

of park for one part of his flock, becaufe the grafs was better 
there than in the neighbourhood of his cave. The year before, 
he had lain there feveral nights in the fummer time^ being 
grievoufly tormented with mufkitoesat his old dwelling-place. ' 
For this reafon he called the fpot his country fear. His 
ttrength being quite gone, he was not able to go any farther. 

Whatever danger there might be in paffing the night in fo 
un(afe a place, neceffity obliged him to ftop there. Quite 
worn out with fatigue, and ms mind IHll agitated with fear, 
he lay down to take feme repofe ; but fcarcely was he half 
afleep, when a frefh fubje^ of terror had nearly deprived him 
of his fenfes once more. 

Rich. Poor fellow ! to what alarms he is expofed 1 

Eiifw, What w as the matter, then ? 

Mr. BilL He h^ard a voice in the air, which very diftin^^ 
ly uttered thefe words, " Robinfon, poor Robinfon ! where 
have you been? How came you here?'* 

Rich. Blefs me ! what could it be ? 

7l/r. Bili* Robinfon ftarted up, all in a tremble, not know- 
ing what to think. He hears the- fa me words repeated ; he 
ventures to turn his eyes towards the quarter from which ihe 
voice came, and finds what think ye ? 

The Children, Nay, we can't tell. 

Ml-. BilL He found, what a co^vard,, if he Would take the 
pains to examine before he gave way to his fears, would almoft 
always find — that he had no reafon to, be alarmed ; he found 
that it was no voice in the air, but the voice of his own 
parrot, which was perched upon the branch of a tree clofe by. 
f ^he Children, Ha I ha ! ha ! that is droll enough. 

Mr. BilL No doubt the bird was tired of being left alone 
in the cave, and as it had many a time before followed its 
matter to the place where he now was, it came rhiiher tofeek 
him, and pronounced the fame words which Robinfon had re- 
peated to It hundreds of times. 

Hia fright was now turned to joy at having found out the 
caufe of the falfe alarm. Robinfon ttretches out his hand and 
calls ** Poll !'* Thjs Bird flies to him, and welcomes him with 
a hundred fond careflTes, all the while crying, *' Robinfon ! 
poor Robinfon ! where have you been ?'* 

Still reftlefs and apprehenfive, Robinfon fcarce clofed hb 
eyes the whole night. He had for ever, before him the hor- 
rid ipot which firft occafioned his fright. He ttrove, but in 
v£in, to banifh it from his imagination ; all his endeavours 

were 



ROBINSON. CatrSOE. I4} 

^were tp no purpofe. When once the imagination receiTes 
« violent (hock, to what extremities does it caufe a man's 
thoughts to wander ? What a cloud of darknefs doc% paf- 
lion ipread oyer his rear9n ? Robinfoa thought of a thou* 
fand plans for his future fecurity, every one more extrava- 
gant than the other. Amongft the reft— would you be- 
lieve it?— he had formed the refolution of deftroying, as 
foon as it was day4ight> all the works that he had made* 
and not to leave a trace remaining of all that had cod him 
fo much labour. The copfe in which he now lay, and 
the hedge enclofing the whole park, were to be deftroyed; 
his lamas turned loofe ; his dwelling-place at the cave» and 
the willow row« to be all demoliihed ; his garden and trees 
to be grubbed up; in (hort, every thing was to be facri* 
ficed to his &fet^. He would not have the fmalleft ap^ 
);>earance remaining of any thing that might ieem to be the 
work of man*8 hands. 

J2/VA. For what reafon ? 

Mr, Bill. That, if the favages ihould chance to pay a 
vifit to this fide of the ifland, they might not perceive, nor 
even fufpedi* that there was a man. there.

I^Y dear chHdrcn, it is a good proverb which advifes mr 
/Jj f (?»/4// aur pilltrui before we take any. important re* 
fclution. Robinfon found the advantage of conforming to 
this advice. 

You remeipber the ftrange refolutions which hiJs excef- 
ive fear made him form. He was very happy that ht 
put off the performance -of them until the next day. Scarce 
jbad the mild light or morning difperfed the fhades of night,, 
when he faw doings in q^uite a oifFerent view. What be 
before judged prudent and neccflary, appears to him a 
^nfelefs and extravagant projed. In a word, he rejefts alJ 
the haHy fchemes that fear had put in his^ hekd, and 1^ 
forms other plans which his fober judgment approves. 

Let his example teaqh you, that^ in afeirs which x»&y 
be pat off,^ you ihould not pafs from refolving immediately 
Xp performing ;; defer this latter till the next day, as ofteni 
as yoa conveniently can.. 

Robinfon now f^w and acknowledged that his fiieht, the* 
day before, had been carried to an extravagant pitch. ** I 
have been here," faid "he, *^ a long time, and no favage- 
has ever yet come near^ my habitauon, which is^ proof 
enough that they are not fettled in this iHand^, It is moil 
fikely that they are inhabitants of another ''ifland, fronv 
whence fome of them come here now and then, to celebrate- 
their vidlories by a horrible feaft ; and probably they never 
land but at the Southern point of the ifl^d, and return tp, 
their own country without having the curiofity to come any 
farther. It is„ therefore, by the particular diredion of 
Heaven that I have been thrown on this part of the coafl, 
the lead fertile in the whole ifland. This very difadvan-su 
tage is now the caufe of my fecurity. 
. *« Why fliould I not hope that the fame good Providence 
will continue to prote<5t me againft all daiigers, fince I have 
hitherto been fo remarkably preferved from the greateA ?*' 
He then reproached himfdf bitterly for having the night 

before 



R O V I N S OK C K U S aS. §45 

before fhewn fo little confidence in his hearenly Father. 
Filled with forrow and repentance, he threw hijnfelf prof- 
trat^ on the ground,' to implore pardon for this new fault* 
Having now recovered his ftrength, he walked towards his 
cave to put in execution the new defigns which he had juflt 
fbrmed* 

RicJ^» What did he propofe to do? 

Mr. BtlL He intended to take fome proper meafures for 
his greater fecurity, which was very reafonable : for ai«\ 
though it be our duty to depend on Providence, being per-r 
fiiadedy that, while we conform our lives to the divine pre- 
cepts, we (hall not be forfaken in time of need, yet, on our 
iide, we (hould negle^ nothing that may contribute to our 
ha^inefs or fecurity ; foi' we certainly were never endowed* 
with reafflfn, nor our minds, nor even our bodies, enriched 
with fuch various faculties an^ powers, for any other pur«> 
pofe, but that we (hould^as far as in us lies^ make them all< 
unite towards^ rendering us^more fecurely happy. 

The fltd thing that he did, warto pknt, without {i<k, ar 
a fmall difiance from the trees which enclofed the front 
^ace before his cave, a thick wood which might cover ir 
at a didance,. and hinder, it from being feen. 

With' this defign, he planted,^ one after another, fifar 
two thoufand ilips of that fort of willow which he had be- 
fore obferved to take root and grow up in To ihort a time* 
He took good care not to plant them in rows : on the con- 
trary, he avoided all regularity, on pUrpofe to give the 
whole the appearance of a natural growth rather than o^ 
artificial arrangement. He refolved dext to dig afubter-. 
raneous paifage from the bottom of his cave to the other 
fide of the hill, that, in a cafe of extremity, as,' for in- 
flance, when the enemy ihould have fcaled his barricade^ 
he might have a back-way to efcape by. This was alfo a 
troublefome and tedious talk; and you muft underfiand^ 
^at, in order to have leifure for it, he was obliged to give 
up the making of the canoe for a while. 

In opening this fub terraneous paifage, he began exafily^ 
as miners do, who firil dig a pit and then a gallery. 

Geo, What fort of a gallery ? 

Rich, Do you forget ? I can tell you. The miners, in 
inakine a jtnine, (ijS dig into the earth firaight down, as 
thofe ao who are digging a well ; and this perpendicular 
opening they call a pit. When thejr are eome to a certain *

4eD^li> thtj begin to holUfw it out horizontally $ and thi» 
paifage they call a gallery. Thus they go on from pits to 
galleries, and from galleries to pit8> until they come to the 
Teio or bed of metS which chey are feeking. 
» Mr. Bill. Very well explained. Obferve, that when 
they dig thus fideways^ or horizontally, the earth which it 
over their heads would foon crumble down, if they did 
not takecare^ as they went on, to keep it up : this they do 
by means of crofs planks^ which reach from one fide of the 
paflage to the other, and reft upon uprights. Robinfoa 
took the fame precaution. 

Whatever earth he cleared out of it, he carried dpie to 
the hedge, and took care to level it. Thus, by degrees^ 
Ite nuied a terrace^ about ten feet high, and almoft eight 
thick. As convenient diftances^ he had left openings, or 
port-holes, that he might fee the out-.country. He had^ 
beiides, made fteps to go up to the top of the terrace, ta 
cafe he (hould, one day or other, be obHged to defend fai$ 
little fort from the top of his rampart. 

He feeraed now fufliciently fecured againft a fudden or 
4tort attack. But, then» if the enemy (hould be obftinatei^ 
and block him up for feme time,, what are to be his re* 
iburcesB 

This blocking up was not a vain fancy: it was by na 
peans impoffible that fuch a thing might happen fome day 
or other. He thought it, therefore, neceifary to provide 
alio againft fach .an event, and to contrive means whereby 
be might avoid the neceffity of furrendering for want of 
provifions, or elfe dying of hunger. ' To prevent any fuch 
^tremity, he refolved to keep confiantly within the enclo- 
fure, at leaft, one of his lamas that gave milk, and to have* 
by way of referve for the fupport of this animaU ^ fmali 
rick of hay, which was not to be touched unlefs in cafe of 
neceftity. He was moreover refolved to lay up a ftock of 
cheefe^ fruits, and o^fters, and recruit it from day to day^ 
according as the one or the other became unfit to keep. 

He had thought of another defign, but was obliged to 
give it up, forefeeing that it would be too tedious in the 
execution. He was defirous that the water of the neigh- 
bouring fpring, which formed a fmall rivulet, might bc 
conveyed, if poffible, to the very door of his cave, that, la 
cafe of a fiege, he might not be deprived of fo necefiary a 
conveniency. To ^cft this, be would have been obliged 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

tQ cut through a fmall hill, which, however, was large 
enough to require a very confidcrable time before the la-- 
bour of a fingle man could complete fuch a cur. He 
thought it, therefore, better to give up the idea, and return* 
. to the making of his canoe. 

For forac years there happened nothing worth relating^ 
I haften now to an event which had more influence on the 
lot of Robinfon, than all that had happened to him in his* 
iiland as yet. 

One £ne clear morning,^ as he was working at his ca-^ 
Boe, he perceived a very thick fmoke rifing at a diflance.. 
The terror with which he was at firft feized upon fight of this^ 
javc way to curiolity. He haftened to the top of his little 
hillock to difcover the true caufe of the fmoke. Scared/ 
was he arrived there, when he was ibuck with: confterna— 
tion at the fight oFfive or fix canoes drawn up on the 
beach, and a fcore or two of favages dancing round a greats 
fire, with the mod fantaHic motions and horrid cries ima-^ 
ginable. 

Though Robinfon ought to have expeflied fUch a fight 
one time or other, yet here again he was near falling into a*. 
fwoon with terror. However, this time he quickly reco- 
vered his fpirits, by placing his confidence in his Maker,. 
He ran down the hill to put himfelf in apofture of defence^^ 
took his arms, implored the affiftance olP Heaven, and> 
firmly refolved to defend his life to the laft extremity, 
fortified in this refolution by his piety, he found himfelF 
matter of fufficient courage and prefence of mind to go up» 
again by his ladder of ropes to the top of the hill, from) 
whence he wa& defirous of viewing all (he enemy's mo^ 
t:ons. 

Prefently his indignation and horror was rai(ed to the* 
bigheft pitch, when he beheld them drag two unfortunate- 
wretches from the. canoes towards , the pkce where the fire 
was. He fufpec^ed, at firft fight; that they were goings 
to difpatch them; and he very (oon found that he was not 
miftakcn. Some of thefc monflfers kill'one of the capiives^i. 
and two othefSL fall upon him, no doubt, in order to cut him^ 
into pieces, and prepare their abominable feafh. During: 
this ihocking execution, the other prifoner fat a nrelancholy 
fpedator of what was doing,, in the expe^ation of very 
foon receiving the fame treatment in his turn. But while- 
ttitil; barbariant were bufily taken npwith the butchery of

h'u companion^ he watches a moment when nobody had aii;^ 
eye gpon him,. and, with the hope of efcaping death, he 
fuddeuly flarta away, and fiaes-wich aftoniftiiiig fwiftoeis^ 
diredlly towards Robinfon's dwelling-place.. 

Joy, hope, fear, and horror, alternately feized on Ro-^ 
binfon's heart ; they appeared fucceffively in his^ counte-> 
jiance, wJbich was pale and red by tiirns. He felt a joy; 
mingled with hope>. when be obferved the prifoner to gaia 
ground confiderably on his purfuers : he was filled witb* 
fear and horror wlien he faw both parties-coming as flraightr 
)k9 pofljble towards his habitation. They were feparated^ 
from it only by a fmall creek, which the favage, who fled,^ 
muft crofs by fwimming^ to avoid falling into the enemy^ 
hands. As foon as he came to the baiHc of it,^ he threvir 
Iximfelf in without hefitation^. and crofled it with the- 
fwiftnefs that he had exerted in running. Two of thofe: 
who were neareft to him threw themfelve» in after him». 
and all the refi returned to their abominable feaft*. Ro* 
binfon perceived, with much fatisfa^tioh^ that thefe two^ 
laft were not, by a great deal>, fuch expert fwimmers as he- 
whom they purfued. He was landed before they had half 
crolTed the creek. At this moment^ Robinfon was ani*^ 
mated with a courage and zeal, fuch as he had never feltv 
before : his eyes fparkled ;, his heart tli robbed j,,and feemed; 
lo urge him to the affiflance of the weaker party. He- 
takes his fpear, and^^ without hefitatiug, runs down from 
the jop of the hillock. In the twinkling of an eye he^ 
paiTes through the grove>. and>. coming out on the other 
£de> finds himfelf jufl between the purfuers and the pur- 
fued. He cries to the latter>.** Stop! flop!" but he turn* 
ing about, is terrified at the looks of Robinfon dreft up m* 
ikins; he takes him for fome fuperior being, and hefitates 
whether to fall at his feet or run away from him. Robin-^ 
foo, Hretching out his hand^ gives him to underftand, by 
£gns, that he was his^ friend, and then,, turning abouc^, 
marches towards the enemy. When within reach of the 
fbremoft favagr^ he throws his fpear at him,^ and ilrikea^ 
bim to the ground. The other favage, being about one 
hundred yards behind, flops, quite furprifed^. fixes an ar^ 
TOW to his bow, and difcharges it at RobinfoD>,who wat 
coming up to him. The arrow flruck him on tbe left 
breadj,, where the heart lies ;. but luckilyit came with np- 
great iorce, and the tkw kept it off as well at a coat of ar-

nour could have done. The arrovtr fell at Robinfon'^K 
feety and he felt not the fmallefL hurt from it. 

Our hero does not give his enemy time to (hoot a fe^ 
cond arrow ; he ruihes upon him, and, before the favage 
can draw the bowilring, Robinfoa lays him lifelefs in th6^ 
duft. 

He now turns towards him whom he had proteded« and^ 
fees him dill on the fame fpot motionlefs^ between hope 
and fear,, doubting, whether the adion that he nad jufl: 
beenwitnefs to».wa8 meant for his prefervation, or whether 
lie himfelf muiC fall, in hi^ turn, beneath (be mighty blows 
of this unknown being. The conqueror calls him ; makes 
. liim underfland, by figns, that he is to come nearer. He 
at ilril obeys, then flops, walks on a little way> fiops^ 
again, advances llowly with evident marks of fear, and ia- 
the attitude of a fuppliant. Robinfon makes him everjr 
lign of friendihip poflible^ and invites him to come clofc- 
tip to him. The favage approaches^ but at every ten fleps^ 
proftrates himfelf on the ground^ at the fame time to thank 
him and to teilify his fubmiilionlo him. 

Robinfon takes off his ma(k, and looks at him with a* 
hiild, humane, and friendly air. At this light the favage 
hefitates no more, but flies towards his deliverer, proftrates 
himfelf, kiifes the ground, takes one of Robinfon's feet and 
puts it OB his neck, to fignify that he was his (lave. But 
our hero, who knew that he had moreoccadon for a friend: 
than a ilaV^, quickly held out his hand to him in a friendly 
manner, raifed him up, and endeavoured, by all the mean^^ 
imaginable, to convince him tharhe (hould be well ufed.. 
However, there dill remained fomcthing to be done. 

The, firil favage was wounded, but not killed; Being 
now come to himfelf, he was gathering herbs and apply- 
ing (hem to his wound to flop the blood. Robinfon madei 
the favage, who flood near him, obferve this, who imme- 
diately fpoke fome words in return. Though Robinfoai 
did not underfland them^yer they pleafed his ear-by their 
novelty, being the firil found of the human voice that he. 
bad heard for many years. The IndTan, ^ing. his eyesD 
alternactly upon Robinfon. and his hatchet, pointing to it 
^with his finger, and then drawing his hand back again^ 
fhily, gave him to underfland that he d^fired this weapoi^ 
to difpatch the enemy* Our hero, though loth to (hed hu--

irounded favage, gWes his. hatchet, and turns hi« eyes fKonr 
feeing che bloody ufe that is going to be made of it. The 
Indiaii runs up to his adverfary, flrikes off his bead at a 
blow, and returns with the cruel fmile of gratified revenge. , 
Then making a thoufand wry faces, and throwing him*' 
felfinto a thoufand odd poftures^^he lays at Robinfon'i 
feet, by way of a trophy, ibe hatchet, together with the 
bleeding head of the lavage he had killed. 

Robiofon made figns to him to gather up the bows and 
Narrows of the ilain, and to follow him*. The Indian, iii' 
return, gave him to underhand, by figns, that, .before they 
went away, it. would be proper to bury the two dead fa- 
Teges in the fand, that, if their companions (hould after* 
wards come to feekvthetn, they might not find any remains 
of them, 

Robinfon having fignified that he approved this precau* 
tiqp, the Indian fell to work with the amfiance only of his 
bands, but with fo much^divity and difpatch, that in lefs 
than a quarter of an hour the two bodies were buried.. 
Tiiey then fet out together toward^ Robinfon's abode, and 
went up to the top of the. hillock; 

CburlotUi But, papa, was not Aobinfon guilty of muc«- 
dcr? 

Hewpy. Oh! thofe thsu he had killed were favages;. 
there was no harm in killing them^ 

Ci^tfr/flZ/r. Yet fliU they were men. ' \ 

Mr.BilL Certainly they were men, my dear Henry;.: 
itvages or civilized is not the point. The l|ueftioa is« 
Had Robinfon a right to take away their lives ? 

Rich. I think he did very right, 

Mr.JiUL And why? 

Rich. Becaufe they were inhuman creatures, and would 
bave murdered a ppOr wretch who perhaps had never done 
them, any harm. 

Mr. Bill. How did Robinfon know that? Might not 
the favage who was purfued have deferved death ? The 
others were, perhaps, .officers of juftice, aiSting under the 
authority of their fuperiors. Bcfides, who had made Ro» 
binfon judge between them ? 

EdtAj. If he had not killed them, they would have dif* 
Covered his retreat|^nd have told ail their companions of 
it..

Geo. And they would all have come in a body>>nd have: 
murdered our poor R^binfon. 

Henry. And devoured bis body. 

Mr Bill, Why that is» a pretty good reafon. You are 
oot far wronger he had a right to do it for his fecurity.. 
But, am, I excufable iti taking away another man's life • 
that I may preferve my own ? 

TJfe Children. yes,,certainlyi- 

Mr. Bill. Why fo ? 

Rich. Becaufe it is the will of'our: Maker tl^t we pre*, 
ferve our lives aS: long as it is in our power : whenever,, 
therefore>.any one. goes about to deprive us of life, it mufl: 
certainly be juft to prevent him by taking ^'ay his, if there^ 
be no other means. « 

Mr- 5///.. Without doiH>t,.my dear children* fuch a forced, 
defence of ourfelves is allowable by all laws divine and ha* 
man ; provided,, however, that we. have abfdutely no other

without doing fe, either by flight, or bv the proteftion 9f, 
others, or,, laftly,, by putting it out o£ hi^ power to hurt. 
OS, ,we are then guiltv of murder, .and amenable to the law, . 

Remember, my dear children, to thank God that yoi^i

^$% THE W E W 



SIXTEENTH E V E N I N C. 



KfR. BILL. What fBall I read to you this evening ? 

•* "^ ne ChiUren. The New Robinfon Crufoe ! 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon's lot, my dear children, in which we 
are all fo deeply concerned, is ftill very uncertain. He 
went up, as I told you yefterday evening, along with the 
lavage whom he had juft delivered, to the top of the luH 
Behind his dwellings being BoA of them exceedingly un- 
cafy as to what might ftill befell them. The pofture of 
their affairs was dangerous and critical; for, was it not 
very likely, that the favages, after their horrible feaft, 
would fet out to feek their two companions who were miiT. 
ing, as well as the vidtim that had elcaped from them ? In. 
iuch a cafe, it could not be doubted but they would difcover 
Robinfon's habitation, and, uniting all their forces, have 
broken into it, and maffacred him, together with his new 
companion. 

All thefe thoughts came into his^ mind, while from the 
top of a hiHock and fheltered by a tree he took a view of 
the favages, who, by their extravagant dances and horrid 
howlings, expreiTed the joy that they felt after their barbae 
rous feaft. He deliberated how he ihould aft ; whether to 
fly,^ or fhuf himfelf up in his fort. His thoughts rifing to 
the Almighty Proteftor of Innocence, he found in himfelf 
courage and refolution enough to choofe the latter deternm. 
nation. In order not to be perceived, he flipped behind 
the bu(hes> crept to his ladder of ropes, made a flgn to his. 
companion to follow him and do a3 he did,, and v«ry foons 
they were both at the bottom. 

The Indian^ feeing the commodious arrangementof every^ 
thing in his deliverer's dwelling-place, was feized with fur* 
prife. His eyes had never beheld any thing fo well laid^ 
out. He felt the fame fort of admiration which a hu/band«-^ 
man would, who. from the wildeft part of the country^ 
flipuld find himfelf all of a fadden in the midft of i pa^ 



ItOBINSO N CRI7S0E. I53 

Robmfon endeavoared by figns to make him urxderftand 
what they had to fear from the favages> if united* and that^ 
in cafe they fhould come to attack him> he was refolved tp 
defend himfelf to the laft extremity, and even to death. The 
Indian underwood him> and immediately, with a refolute air> 
brandifhes tlie hatchet, which he ftill held, feveral times oyer 
his head, lodes with a threatening countenance towards the 
enemy as if challenging them to combat, and thus en<ieavours. 
to afTure his deliverer that he was ready to defend himfelf 
courageoufly. Robihfon applauded thefe marld ox intrepidity, 
armed the Indian with a ipear, a bow and arrows, and placed, 
him fentinel at a kind of port-hole which he had made in his 
terrace, that he nnght have a view of whatever p^ed in the 
empty fpace between that and the wood which he had planted. 

About an hour afterwards, they heard^ all at once, Grange 
and dreadful cries at a diftance, which &emcd. to come from^ 
many favages together* Thj?y both prepared for combat,^ 
and, by thetr kxMcr, mutually encouraged each other to make 
the moft vigorous defence. The cries ceafed— prefently 
they began again, louder and nearer—- tliey are fucceeded by 
a de«p filence— Quite near at hand— •

their bows, were bent : the fir ft favage that (hewed himfelf

SEVENTH £NTH EVENING. 



]\jfk. BILL. We kft night left Robinfon and his compa-i 
nion on the watch, to obferve whatever might be gomg 
forward on tlie outilde of the barricade. They, continued oa 
guard dll it was almoft night ; but having perceived no ene- 
my, nor heard any voice for fome houra, it feemed very 
probable, that the favagcs, difappointcd in their fearch> had 
returned to their canoes, and were gone back to their own 
ifland. They laid down their arms, therefore, and Robin^ 
fon brought out fometlung for fupper. 

As this day, fb particularly remarkable in the adventurea 
of our hero,^ happened to be a Friday, he refolved, in fome 
meafure, to perpetuate the remembrance both of the day and 
the events which dilHnguifhed it, by giving to the favage> 
wJiofe life he had faved, the name of Friday. 

, Till now, Robinfon had fcarce time to look at him witk 
attention. He was a well-made young man, about twe^tv 
years of age ; his complexion was fwarthy, his hair black 
and long, not woolly like that of the negroes ; his nofe was 
fhort, though not very flat, his lips fmall, and his teeth as white 
v^ ivory. In his ears he wore various featherai and ihells, an 

ornament 



ROBINSON C R U S O 2. I^J 

ornament on which he feemed to lay no fmall value ; ia 
(fther refpeds he was naked. 

Rol)infon, who had a'proper regard for decency, would 
not go to fupper, though hunger called him preffingly, until

^y of apron. He then made figns to him to fit down be- 
fide him and eat his fupper 1 Friday ^ as we fhall now call 
him, approaches Robinfon with all the tokens imaginable of . 
refpedt and gratitude ; he falls down on his face before him, 
and places the foot of his deliverer on his own neck, as ho 
had done before. 

Robinfon, whofe heart could fcarce contain his joy on 
having found at length a companion and a friend, which he 
had fo long and earneftly wifhed for, would have been glad 
to exprefs it by a thoufand marks of kindnefs ; but, not 
knowing the character of his newgueft, he thought it prudent^ 
for his own fecurity, to keep him in a flate of refpedful fub* 
je6tion, to receive his homage as due to him, and, in a word^ 
to aft as his fovereign for fome time. He made him, there- 
fore, under Hand by figns that he would talce him under liis 
protedion, but on condition of perfed obedience ; that he 
ihould perform whatever he was ordered, and abllajn from 
every thing which he, his lord and mafter, (hould, of his 
good will and pleafare, forbid him. While he inibuded 
nim thus by figns, he pronounced the word C act que » For- 
tunately he remembered to have once heard that the favages 
of South America call their chiefs and princes by that name. 
By this word Friday underflood, much better than by the 
figns which accompanied it, what his mafler meant ; and, to 
(hew that he accepted the condidon of obeying, he repeated 
the word Cacique feveral times with a loud voice, intimating 
that he applied it to Robinfon, and fell down proftrate at his 
feet dnce more. To fignify what refped he bore to the royal 
authority, he put a fpear into Robinfon's hands, and fixed 
the point againft his own breafl, fhewing and acknowledging 
thereby that his mafter had the power of life and death over 
him. Robinfon, with the dignity of a monarch, held out 
hb hand to him, affuring him of his protedion, and ordered 
him again to fit down befide hifti and eat his fupper. Friday, 
out of refped, fat down on the ground, while Robinfon was 
placed on a feat of turf.

Weak men implored the prdtedion and heI|>of the ftronger» 
either to defend them frdm the danger of wild beafts, which 
were, in early times, more numerous than at prefent, or to 
iecure themfehres againft the injolHce of violent men. In 
return, they promifed to fubmit entirely to them, and to p^ 
them every year a certain part of their fruits and flocks, mat 
the protedlors, not having to provide for their own fubfiftence, 
might be wholly at leifure to defend their fubjedls. This 
yearly payment, which the fubjedh obliged themfelves to 
make good to their king, was called by the name oftrihutei 
impoft^ public taxes^ and the like. Such is the origin both 
of the power and riches which dl the dilFerent forts ofYuler* 
in the world enjoy, and of the duty and fubmiflion which their 
€ubje£ts pay them. 

' Robinfon was now, therefore, in effeft a king. The 
ifland was his kingdom, his lamas and his fruits were his 
treafure, and Friday his fubjed ; his only one, it is true, but « 
valuable one. His parrot was the only courtier that he had, 
and almoft ufelefs in that character. Neverthelefs, his majefty

figrprife you, and you would hardly believe it, if I did not 
affure you that it is found in clear and exprefs terms in the 
annals of Robinfon's reign, which have been made public to 
the whole world many years ago. Robinfon Crufoe, king of 
a whole ifland,abfolutemafter of the life and death of all his 
fubjefts, did not blufh, in the leail, to defcend, in the pre- 
fence of Friday, to a fervile office. He went to the lamas 
that were kept in his enclofure, and with his own kingly 
hands began to milk them. It was meant for the inrtrudion 
of his prime miniiler, and to Ihew him how to do the fame, 
as he intended, for the future, to commit the care of this 
builoefs to him. 

Friday, with all his atteation^ could not underftand what 
his mafler was doing ; for neither he nor his Hupid country- 
men had ever fufpeSled that the milk of animals might be 
proper food for man, and as wholefome as it was nourilhing. 
He had never tailed any, and was agreeably furprifcd at the 
fweetnets of it, when Robinfon perfuaded him toputfometo 
his lips for a trial, ^ 

After the fatigues which they had fufFered during the day, 
they both found themfelves in want of repofe. Robinfon^ 
therefore, ordered his flave to go to the place of reft which 
he had pointed out to him, and lay down himfelf, bleffing 
Heaven for having, in one day, preferved him from fo many 
dangers, and given him one of his fellow-creatures to be his 
companion, and, perhaps^ his friend.

JDICHARD, I am curious to know what Robinfon will un* 
xiertake now with his man Friday. 

Edtv. Now that he has alliftance, he will be able to per- 
form many things which he could not before.

engraven on our hearts the inclination tha,t leada m to ftek 
the company and fHend(hi{> of our fellow-creatures. 

Hie nril thing that Robinfon did the next mornin|;» was 
to go with Friday and examine the foot where the lavages 
had held their abominable feaft the day before. In their 
walk» thev came to the place where the two Indians were 
buried, whom they had then (lain. Friday pointed it out 
to his mafter, and plainly hinted that he was defirous of 
Egging up the dead bodies and fatisfyin^ his unnatural 
appetite upon them. Robinfon, with a look c^detefbition and 
horror, fhewed him how much he difliked fuch an inclination^ 
andf lifting up his fpear in a threatening manner, fignified 
to him that he would run it through his b^y if ever he touch- 
ed them. Friday underftood his matter's threatening, and 
fubmitted without hefitation to his orders ; yet he could 
not conceive why he was forbidden to tafte a fort of food, of 
which, from his earlieft youth, he had always been extremely 
fond. 

They foon arrived at the place of the ftaft. What a fight! 
The ground ftained with blood'! Bones fcattered about! 
Robinfon turns his eyes away from it, and ordered Friday 
immediately to make a hole, and bury thefe loathfome re- 
jnains of barbarous voracity. 

While Friday was at work, according to his orders, Ro- 
binfon was carefully ftirring the aihes backwards and for- 
wards, in the hopes of lindmg fome fire ftill amongfl them : 
but to no pturpofe ; the whole was extinguifhed, much to 
Robinfon's difiatis^Eidion, who, next to the valuable gift which 
Heaven had lately made him in his companion, had now 
fcarce any thing left to wiih for, except a fire. While he 
hung his head and looked forrowfnlly upon thefe aflies, the re« 
mains of fire totally extinguifhed, Friday feeinc" him fo me- 
lancholy, made feveral fiigns which Robinfon did not at all 
comprehend ; then he fnatches up the hatchet, flies off like 
lightning, darts into the wood, and leaves Ilobinfbn, who 
knew not his defign, in the ereatefi; aftonifhment pofiUde. 
Having followed him mSi his eyes as long as he cooU*

to take poiTeffion of my dwellmg-place, and keep me oat of

by ftratagem to his favage countrymen?" — Horrid thought !

in purfuit of the ungrateful traitor, at once to punilh an* 
prevent his bafe attempts. Already he was running full 
{peed, when, fuddenlpr> he perceived Friday returning as 
faft. Robinfon ftops in a fiirprife ; he {ees, to his no fmall 
afloniihmentj the imaginary traitor holding up in tlie air a 
fmall bundle of dried grafs, which firll appeared to fmoke, 
and then to be on fire. Friday thro»*s it down, and haflily 
gathers round it other grafs and dry branches, and kindlet 
a bright clear fire> which fills j^obinfon with joy andl 
aftonimment. He then underflood the reafon of Friday's 
fudden abfence. Not able to contain his joy, he flies, with 
tranfportj to Friday, embraces him with ardour and affec- 
tion, and, in his own mind, ^fks him pardon, a thoufand 
times, for the injurious fufpicions that he had entertained 
of him. 

EJw, But where could Friday have found fire ? 

Mr. Bill. He had haftened into the wood on purpofe ta 
cut two dry branches, Thefe he had rubbed together with 
fuch dexterity and difpatch, that they took fire quickly. He 
then wrapped them up in dry grsds, and, running fwiftl/ 
with this bundle held up in the air, the fire foonidndled the; 
grafs, and broke out in a blaze. 

Mr. Mered. Here,^ again, Robbfon appears to me to br 
very much to blame.' 

Rich, In what rcfpeft, pray? 

Mr, Mind. In this ; that, without having any fufficlent 
proof of Friday's treachery, he forms, in an inllant, the 
blackefl fufpidon of him. How is it poffible to be fo excei-

RUb. What he feared might very well be true ; fo that 
he had a right to be upon his guard againil Friday. 

Mr. Mired* Underftand me right, my dear little friend* 
I do xiot blame him either for thinking it pofEble that he 
was betrayed by Friday, or for running after him to prevent 
the fatal defigns that he might have foimed. This precau« 
tion was allowable, nay neceflary, with refpe^ to a perfo« 
totally unknown to him. But what I am angry with hiat 
for, is, that he never doubted a moment the trudi of his 
odious fofpicions ; that he fuffered himfelf to be tranfported 
with rage j that he was fo wholly maflered by this paffion, 
as never even once to think that Friday's intentions might

proofs of their treachery. In a doubtful cafe, let us fee the 
evil c^ another man — till then let us judge well of him. 

Mr, Bill. A good maxim. Attend to it, my dear chil- 
dren> that you may put it in pradlice hereafter. 

Robinfon, as I told you, was tranfported with joy to find 
his ill fufpicions groundlefs, and himfelf once more in pof- 
feffion of fire, of which he had been fo long deprived, and 
which he had fo long and fo earneftly wifhed for. He delights to 
behold the waving motion of the flame?. At lafthe fnatches 
up a burning branch, and haftens with Friday to the cave. 

He inilantly lights up a large fire, and places potatoes 
round it to roaft. He next runs to his flock, chufes out a 
young lama, kills it, and, having fkinned and cut it up, 
puts a quarter of it on the fpit, which he inflrufts Friday 
how to turn. 

While he is thus employed, Robinfon cuts off a piece from 
the breaft of the lama. He then peels a. few potatoes, brui- 
fes and grinds fome maize between two flat flones to make 
flour of it, and puts the whole into one of his pots, which, 
after he had poured inafuflicient quantity of water, not for- 
getting fait, he fets over the fire 

Geo. I know what he was going to make — fome brorh. 
Mr, Biil, The very thing. He had not tailed any for 
eight years pafl:. You may guefs how much he longed for 
fome. 

Friday looked on while all thefe preparations were mak- 
ing, but did not underfland to what purpofe they were made. 
He was acquainted, indeed, with the cuftom of roafting meat; 
but, as to all the reft of Robinfon's cookery, he was en- 
tirely in the dark. He knew not even the efFe6l which 
lire would produce on a veflfel full of water. The pot began 
to boil juft as Robinfon went into the cave upon fome occa- 
fion or other. Friday, furprifed at this odd appearance, had 
no idea what could thus put the water in motion. But when 
he faw it bubble up and boil over the fides, he imagined, 
in the fimplicity of his heart, that there mull be fome living 
creature at the bottom of the pot, which occafioned this tu- 
mult in the water; ?ind, therefore, left it fhould boil away 
entirely, he put his hand in to feize the creature, what- 
ever it was ; but, inftead of finding that, he felt fome- 
thing which made him roar loud enough to (hake the whole 
hillock. 

Robiiifon was ftartled, on hearing him crying out. His

firft notion was that the favages had furprifed them, and that 
Friday was already taken. Fear, and the patural inftin^l of 
fclf-prefervation, urged him to efcape, and favehis life by 
the facred pafTage under ground ; but he quickly rejedled 
this idea, coniidering how bafe it would be thus to abandon; 
his fubjeft, or rather friend. Without heiitating, therefore,. 
he fallied forth from the cave, firmly refolved to Ihed theJafl 
drop of bis blood, if necelTary, inrcfcuing Friday, onceniore^ 
from the hands of his barbarous enemies. 

Mr, Mered. Now I like you, iny friend Robinfon. 

Mr, Bill. He fprings out, with his -fpear in hia hand ? 
but, to his utter aflonilbment, finds Friday all alone, crying,, 
twi^g himfelf about, and making a thoufand wry faces. 
Robimon flood modonlefs, not knowing what to think ; at 
length he found, after a few figns, by way of eKplanation., 
that all this outcry was occafioned by poor Friday's fcalding 
his hand. 

Robinfon had no fmall difficulty in quieting him. But 
diat yon may know, what Robinfon did not learn until a year 
after, when they were both able to underftand each other ; 
that you may know, I fey, why Friday had madefuch a noife 
and 10 much ado, I muft firft inform you what notions igno- 
rant people, in fome countries, who have had no inflruflion in^ 
their childhood, commonly entertain when an accident hap* 
pens to them of which they know not the reafon. 

Thefo poor people ii^gine that fome invifible being, or 
(ome. fpint, is the caufe ofevery thing for which they cannot 
affign a reafon. According to them, 8iis fpirit never does any 
thing but by the orders of a perfon to whofe fervicc it is bound. 
They diftinguifh, by a particular name, thofe whom they fup- 
pofe to poffefs fuch a power over one or more fpirits ; if it be 
a man, they call him a conjurer ; if a woman, a witch. 

For inflance, in fome places, if an ignorant countryman 
has either of his cattle fallen fuddenly ill, and cannot guefs its 
diforder, he, perhaps, will be weak enough to think that fome 
old perfon in me neighbourhood has bewitched the beaft ; that 
is, made it fall fick by means of an evil fpirit.

^e poor girl of her error ; it will certainly be better for her

i6q, the new 

If, on the one hand, ignorant people give credit to thefe fifly 
notions, there are not wanting, on the other, impoftors who 
turn fuch credulity to their own advantage, and cunningly 
trick thole out of* their money who arc fo weak as to believe 
in witchcraft, or conjuring : ibr, by pretending to the art, 
they confirm the others in the notion that there is really fuch 
'a thing. Under the name of conjurers and fortune-tellers, 
they promife, wicii an air of confident gravity, to break the 
charrri, and force the evil fpirit to loofe irs hold; but they 
always demand, for their trouble, a certain reconapenfe, 
v/hich is to be paid them beforehand. In return for this, 
they amufe their employers with empty words, ridiculous 
grimacer, unmeaning geflures, and nonfenfical mumntery. 
If the bealVs illncfs ceafes of its own accord, the fortune-teller 
triumphs, and the credulous man, whom he has deceived, 
is difpofed, more than ever, to be the dupe of fuch impoflure. 
On the contrary, if the (icknefs gets the better, and the bea I 
dies, the conjurer will, by his evasions and unir.telliribic 
cant, impofe on the ignorant owner, who will afterwards be 
as ready as ever to confult a fortune-teller upon thq fame 
occafion. 

In proportion as men's underftandings nre narrowed by 
prejudice and darkened by ignorance, the more they are in- 
clined to this ridiculous fuperftition : you may imagine, there- 
fore, that it is pretty generally received amongil favage na- 
tions. Whatever crofs accidents happen to ihem, of which 
their weak reafon cannot point out the caufe, they attribute 
them to evil fpirits ; and this was exaftly Friday's cafe. 

He had never heard it faid, nor difcovered by his own ex-i 
perience, that water could be made to boil ; nor had he ever 
felt the effed of it in that ftate, by putting his hand into it ; 
fo that Jie could not conceive whence that acute and fudden 
pain proceeded, which he felt on touching the boiling water, 
and, therefore, firmly believed that there was enchantment in 
it, and that Robinfon was a conjurer. 

I am going to put you on your guard, my dear children, that 
you may not be deceived in thefe matters. You will often, 
in the courfe of your lives, have occafion to fee elFedb of which 
you will not be able to difcover the caufes. You will meet 
with jugglers, perfons who deal in flight of hand, who will

fhould be tempted to believe that there is witchcraft in the

fame error with him, and take that for fupernatural, which,, 
when explained, appears perfeSlly natural and eafy. But, to

venient opportunity, fhew you one or two of thefe tricks, and, 
at' the fame time, explain to you how they are -performed, 
that you may be able to form a judgment of all others of the 
fame nature. 

Robinfon, as I told you before, did not eailly fucceed in 
comforting Friday/ and perfuading him to take his place 
again at the fpit.. He confented to it, however, at laft, but 
could not help looking ftill at the pot with a mixture of cu- 
riofity and horror. As to Robinfon, whom he took for a fu- 
pernatural being, he could not lift his eyes towards him 
without Ihewing the moll timorous. refped. What confirm- 
ed him in his opinion was. his matter's ruddy complexion and 
long beard, which gave him an appe*ance fo different from^ 
^that of Friday and his tawny, beardlefs countrymen. 
. lEdnv, Have the favages of Sbuth America no lyard ? 

Mr, BilL ^k)^ and it has been long thought that they 
were beardlefs by nature. But fome pretend lately to hav« 
obferved that the reafon of their feeming to have no beard,, 
is their taking the greateft care imaginable to pluck it up as ' 
it grows. 

But the broth, the potatoes, and the roaft meat,- were 
now ready. As they had no fpoons, Robinfon poured' 
out the broth in tAo pipkins, hut nothing could induce Fri- 
day fo much as to tafte it j^ he had not the leaft doubt of its. 
being, an enchanted liquor, it made himfhudder to fee Ro-

NINETEENTH EVENING. 



]3 OBINSON had Bever been in fo happy a fituation fincc 
^ his arrival on the iiland as he was now. The only thing 
. that remained to trouble hinv, was his apprehenfion lell the 
favagts (hourd return to feek for their two countrymen. In 
which cafe he.mig^ht probably be expofed to the neceffity of 
ihedding blood. He (huddered at the thought of being re- 
duced, once more, to the dreadfulchoice of either deftroying. 
his fellow-creatures or perifhing cruelly himfelf. 

Things being,therefore, in this fituation, it was incumbent 
en him to labour for his fecurity, and put himfelf into a (late 
of defence. He had long been defirous of fortifying his ha- 
bitation Kill more ; bur, while he was alone, the executioc^ 
of this deOgn appeared impoflible. Now, with the afTiflance 
of a companion^ he thought himfelf capable of undertaking 
it. He mountsv therefore, to the top of his hillock, to form 
a plan of further fortification, which he very foon did, as his 
fituation enabled him to have the whole ground under his. 
eyes at one view. He sefolved, therefore, on the outfide^ 
of the barricade of trees which enclofed his habitation,, to 
dig a broad deep trench, the inner bank of which (hould be 
«[efended wiih a llrong row of paling.. 

He, moreover, conceived the defign of dividmg the neigh- 
bouring rivulet into two branches, one of which (hould run: 
in this trench, and the other through rhe middle of the en- 
clofed fpace before his cave', that,, in cafe of a fiege, he 
might not be in want of water. 

It was noteafy to make Fridlay comprehend, by figns, the 
whole of this plan ; but as fbon as he had fome idea of it, he 
fan to the fea fide, and came back loaded with great (hells, 
and with flat and (harp flones, fit to ferve for digging; They 
both, therefore, feM to work immediately. 

1 dare fay you can eafily imagine that this was no flight 
wnderraking. Tha trench, to be of any ufe, rauft be, at 
lead, £x hex deep and eight broad ; the length might be 
about fourfcore or one hundred yards. 



ROBINSON CHUSOE. 167 

To'exccute fuch an undertaking as this wirbout anyinftru- 
jnent of iron— no pickaxe— no (hovel— think what a difficul- 
ty it mud be. • Betides, it required little lefs than four hun- 
dred pales ; to cut ihefe and (hape ihcm with only one hat- 
chet of flone, was a laborious talk. Laftly, in order to turn 
the rivulet into this trench, there was a neceffiiyof digging 
a canal, which, in onfi place, muft crofs'a rifmg ground ; 
and this, to crown the difficulty of the work, ic was abfo- 
lutely neceflary to cut through. 

All thefe obftaclesdid not difcourage our friend Robinfon, 
who had taken a refolution that was not to be ihaken. By 
leading a life of temperance and continual labour, he was, in 
the execution of difficult undertakings, mafter of a degree of 
courage which is not poflefled by men brought up in idle- 
Bef8> ufed to delicate living, and enervated by effeminacy. 
With Go£s helpy and with perfe^erance^ was his motto> in bc^ 
ginning a work of labour and time ; and you know, when 
once he was determined on a matter^ he nevicr refied until he 
completely finifhed it. 

He was the ikme on this occafion. Friday and he work- 
ed every day with equal pleafure and earnellnefs, from funrifc 
to funfet ; fo that, iii ipite of the awkwardnefs of their in- 
Urumenis, they advanced the work every day furprifingly. 
Fortunately, during two whole months^ the favages never 
appeared;, a contrary wind hindered them from coming over 
to Robinfon's ifland. All this time be was able to work 
• without being obliged to take any precautions againil the fear 
of an attack. 

Robinfon, who wae earneHly defirousof being able to con* 
. verfe with Friday, took the opportunity to teach him a few . 
words of Englifti every day, while they were both employed 
at work ; and Friday^ on his parr, was fo attentive, that in 
a (hort tim« he made a confiderable progrefs. Robinfon 
took the rooH natural and eafy way to communicate the lan- 
guage to hi;n :. wJhenever it could conveniently be done, he 
pla.ed the object before his eyes, and then pronounced the 
Bame of it diilindly ; but when it was neceifary to commu- 
nicate the names of things which could not be made percep* 
tible in this manner^ Robinfod accompanied the name with 
gedures and figtis fo expreffive that Friday could not poffibly 
mifunderlland. And, by thefip means, in lefs than fix 
monthit he was able to explain bimfelf tolerably well in 
Eoglifh. 

This was a frcfh additkui to RobvaJwi'* V^^^xj.^^'^* 



i6$; T K E K t w 

Hitherto Friday had ^en no better than a dumb man to- 
him ; now they are able to communicate their thoughts to 
each other as friends. How frivolous did the pleafure feem 
which Robinton ufed to enjoy in the fenfele/^ chatter of hi« 
parrot, in comparifon to the real fatisfa^tion which be felt 
at pre fen t ! 

The more he knew Friday the ny re he liked him. The 
young man waa frank and good-natured, and had the greac^ 
eft affedion poffible for his mafter : fo that Robin/bn grev^ 
fonder of him every day, and m^de him take fhare of hi« 
cave, that rhey might pafs the nights together* 

In lefs than two months they fini(bed the trench ; and 
now they faw themielves capable of defying thefavagos, or 
even of beating them^olF (hould they venture to attack them ; . 
for before any one of them could crofs the trench and the 
paling^Jt was an eafy matter for the two befieged to fend an 
arrow or a fpear through his body. They looked upon-. 
tberofelves, therefore,,as fufficiently guarded againft all dan- 
ger of this fort.. 

Robiofon and Friday, being one day near the feti-fide upon > 
a rifuig ground, from whence they had an ext^nflve profpedi- 
all over the fea, perceived, at a di (lance, fome iflands-which^ 
appeared like fmall clouds. Fridlay fixed his eyes^ attentive* 
ly on that quarter. All of Z: fudden he ftarts up> falls^a 
dancing, and throws himfelf into fo many extravagant atti- 
tudes, that Robinfon thought he was fetxed with a fudden 
frenzy>. •* Gopdf good !** cried he, ftill continuing to Ikip. 
about. Robinfon aiked him the caufe of this extraordinary 
tranfport. ** Yonder is* my country ;''^ anfwered he^ almoft* 
breathlefs with joy ;. *^ that is where my people live !**^'Hii 
countenance, his cycst hit geflures^ all/expreffied the love 
which he bore his country, and hb defire to fee it once more* - 
Robinfon was not at all pleafed with .this difpofition of Fri-^ 
day*s : it was certainly a laudable one, as it iiiewed that he. 
loved his country^ his friends, and his relations ; neverthelefs» 
Robinfon feared left^ he (hould leave him fomc day.or otliet<>, 
and return to his own iilaod. In order to be certified otL 
this, head, Jherefolved to found his intentions, and».therefore», 
began the following conTerfation^ which will Aewyoa the: 
excellent difpofition of Friday. 

Rolinfoiu Would you be glad, then^ior return teyour 
countrymen, and live amongd them } 
Eridaji. Oh^ yes ;. I ihould be. very glad tafee them again 



RaBINSOK CRUSOE. 169 

Xoi* Perhaps you long to eat man's flefh with them a- 
gahi^ 

Frui. No, certainly^ I would teach tbem not to be fa- 
▼ages> bat to live on milk and the fleih of animals^ and^ abo?6 
all, to abftain from eating men. 

Roi. But» perhaps^ they would eat your/elf ? 
Fridm No, they will never do foi 
Rob. And yet they have deroured many men, and wiU 
many more flill. 
Frid. Ay, hut only their enemies.. 
Rob* Could you make a canoe that would carry you ta 
tfiem? 

Frid. Yes, certainly. 

Rob. We]l^ then, make one, and fet out when you 
pleafe— -How ! you look down ! What b the matter witE 
you ? Why de you look fo forrowful ? 

FriJ. Becauferay dear matter is aagry with me. 
Rfib. Angry V What makes you think fo h 
Frid^ Becaufe he wants to fend me aivay. 
Rclt, Well, but did not you wifii juffcnotv to be ra your 
own country I 

Frid. y es ; but if my matter does not go there«. I wUl 
not go— no— *>no more. 

Rot. Your people would take me for an* enemy and eat. 
sne> fo that you mutt go by yourfelf— Bur, what is the mean* 
log of this i Why do you draw the hatchet from my fidc^ 
and put it into my hand f Why do you lay down yourhead^ 
and ftretch out your neck ? What would you have me do ? 

Frid. Kill me v I would rather dio than be ient away from, 
you. 

Saying thefe words he (hod a fiood of tearf; 
Robinfon was melted with tendernefa, and embraced hnn.. 
ie comforted,, my dear Friday ; I love you too well to wifli 
a feparation £rom you: what I (aid was only to try you, and' 
to Know if your friendfhip was equal to mine,. Thefe tears 
of joy and attedion which you fee me (hed, are pledges of 
my fincerity* Come to my arms once m^re. Let us dry 
up our tears, and never part« 

To diifipate the forrowful idea« that he had excited in 
Friday 'a mind, he fpoke to him again of a canoe>.and aiked 
him feveral quettions upon that fubjed. Being fatisfied 
with his aafwersj^he tookhim by the hand> and led Mm to . 



170 THENEW 

fee the canoe that he had begun fomc years ago. Friday^ 
on examining it, laughed heartily to find the work fo little 
advanced for the time. The tree was fcarce cut into the 
third part of its thickneis. Robinfon afked him what fault 
he found in the work. Friday anfwcred, that he could fee .» 
vad deal of time had been lofl, and labour thrown away 9 which 
might have been fpared, for that a tree like this could be 
hollowed in a few d^ys with fir^ and that much better than 
by any other means whatfoever* At thefe words Robinfon 
was tranfporred with joy: he fancied the canoe already finilh - 
ed ; 'he fancied himfelf already failing, in it oa the oppn fea ; 
already, after a happy voyage, he fancied himfelf landed on 
the continent, and converAng with Europeans. I^ow de- 
lightful were all thefe ideas* I He refblved that the worlc 
ihould be begun the very next morning by break of day. 

Geo, Ah ! then, our amulement wUl foon be at an end. 

Mr. Bill. Howfo? 

Geo. When he has a boat he will foon fet fail, and then^ 
when he comes home,, papa will have nothing more to tell 
us about Robinibn. 

Mr. Bill. And would you not give up that amufement 
for Robinfon' S' fake ? Would you not freely procure him, at. 
that fmall price, relief from the hardihips he labours tinder 
iii his defert ifle ? . 

Geo. Why, yes— ^very true — I did not think of that. 

Mr. Bill. Beiides, who knows what may happen ? Whether 
he may not be obliged to put ofE the working at the canoe j: 
or his own. departure ? The future is v-ery upcertain ; it 
brings with it, lb many changes, that,^, for the moft part, it 
deceives our expectations. We often fee our beft founded 
hopes difappointed, and it is the part, of wifdom to expert 
and be prepared for thefe viciffitudes. 

Robinfon, who had experienced themieveral times already jt 
returned home, perfefUy reiigned to whatever a. good and 
wife Providence (hould. order with refpedi: to the accomplifh- 
ment of his wifh, being perfuaded that his heavenly Father, 
knew better than he what was for his real intereft ; and fuch^ 
I hope, would be our way of thiiddng in fimilar circumstances*.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. I7I 



TWENTIETH EVENING. 



A/[^\ BILL* My dear children, I mentioned to you laft 
night, that, in the affairs of life, the bell founded hopes 
frequently vanifh and end iri difappointment. The adven- 
tures of Robinfon Crufje have fumifhed you with frequent 
inftances of this truth, and you have learned, J hope, from 
them, and thp inilrudlions that I have given you, to bear 
calmljf whatever events may happen contrary to your ex- 
pedlations. But I have foraelhing farther to propofe to you, 
while we are upon the fubjed of l?lf-denial, as proper to ac- 
company the practice of that virtue. It is an exerdfe of the 
greateft utility, and, with your confent, I will mention it, 
716/ Chil/ireri. Oh, yes, papa ! yes, papa I 
Mr, BilL If/ then, you delire m the future part of your 
lives to labour in ilrengthening your bodies, and exalting 
the powers of vour minds, to the end that you may be- 
come diflinguiified charadlers, and capable of contributing 
effectually to the happinefs of your fellow- creatures, and 
thereby to enhance your own, I offer to you, for that pur- 
pofe, the following plan. 

J will, on my fide, read to you, for your inftrudlion., the 
Writings of the ancient phllofop^ers who were preceptors to 
the illuftriou's perfons whom you fo much admired when I 
went over the ancient hiftory with you. Thefe writings con- 
tain the precepts which fiich philolophers gave to their fcho-v 
lars, and by the obfervance of which their fcholars became 
great men. Every week I will write down one of thefe 
precepts upon a table covered with white paper ; I will ex- 
plain it to you, and (hew you how, in the coune of the week,^ 
you may acquire, in aneanr and agreeable manner, the prac- 
tice of it. Yet, you muft not expeft that this can be done 
without fometimes cofting you a facrifice ; you m.uftj ^t one 
time,refolve to deprive yourfelves of a favourite amufement ; 
at another, to bear with things very difagree.able.. ^ This is 
the true way to acquire that mafculine courage which is to 
^i&& us in conquering our irregular ipcUnatipns, and in pre<^ 

ferving^ 



17a T H E N E W 

ferving a prudent equanimity upon all occafions of lofs, dif- 
appointment, and danger. As to us who arc advanced in 
life, we fliall not be contented with merely pointing out the 
path to you; we will walk in it ourfelves, and be your guides: 
in fhort, we (hall advife you to nothing of which we (hall not 
at the fame time fhew you the example. What fay you, my 
dear children, to this propofal ? 

The Children, We agree to it j we agree to it. 

Mr. BilLV cry well, then we (hall begin the firil convenient 
day. It is now time to return to Robinfon. What I hinted 
to you yefterday merely as pofTibie, did, however, happen 
in reality. ' . * . 

The Children, What was that, papa? 

Mr, Bill. 1 faid, that, whatever reafon Robinfon might 
have to hcipe for a probable and fpeedy depart uie JFrom hi» 
ifland, there might, neverthelefs, happen fome unforeieen 
obftacle which would caufe him to retrain on it longer. 
This obftacle appeared the very next day. 

O n that day the rains began, and fet in with great violence. 
Robinfon, during his ftay on the ifland, had remarked that 
they take place regularly twice a year, and always about 
the time of the equinoxes. During this rainy feafon, which 
generally lifted a month or two, it was impoflible to do any 
work in the open air, it rained io hard and fo incelTantly.. 
He had alfo experienced, that nothing was more prejudicial to 
the health than to go much out of doors, or to get wet during 
this feafon. What was he to do now ? He found it abfo- 
luccly neceflary to put oiFthc boilding of the bdat, and tor 
iind fome employment without going out of his cave. 

What a happinefs for Robinfon, during thefe wet days and 
the long dark evenings of this feafon, to have fire and light, 
befides the company of a friend, with whom, while the/ 
were both at work together ^i he mighty converfe familiarly, 
and fill up the wearifome hours with agreeable" employment! 
Formerly, he ufed to pafs thefe dull evenings all alone, ia 
the dark, and without ahy thing to do ; whereas, now, fit- 
ting with Friday before a good fire, and cheered with the 
light of a lamp, he converfes with a fellow creature, and ia 
not afraid of time hanging heavy upon his hands. 

He learned from Fnday all the methods vdiich the favages 
have for procuring themfelves any conveniency, and Robin- 
fon, in his turn, taught him a thoufand things of which 
favages have npt the leaft idea. Hios they both enlarged 

th« 



ROBINSON CR U S O E. IJj 

the extent of their knowledge and induftry. By. mutual 
affillance, each exerting his paxtitular. talent, they fuccepded 
in making feveral fmall pieces of work wfiicli would; have 
been impoffible to' either of them lirigly : and this convinced 
them how infinitely advantageous it is for men to be United 
by fociety, and held together, as it were, by^the bonds of 
focial aifeftion and- love of their fellow- creatures, in com- 
parifon to being difperfed, and -wandering on the earth, each 
byhimfelf, like brute beafts. 

Of the bark of trees Friday could make mat* bf a texture 
fufficiently fine and firm at the fame time to make a fort of* 
Ibaif proper for cloathing. Robinfon, having learned the 
manner of this work, made, in conjunction with Friday, a 
ftock fufficient for cloathing them both. Audit was no fmall 
fatisfaftion to him that he was now able to quit thofe incon- 
venient garments made of hard raw hides, which he had hi- 
therto been obliged to wear. 

Friday had alfo the art of "making ', cordage out of the 
ftringy covering of the cocoa-nut and the bark of plants re-' 
fembhng flax ; and this cordage was far fuperior to any that 
Robinfon could make. He had, alfb, a particular method 
of making nets with thread ; an occupation which' feemed to 
render many an evening fhort that would other wife have 
been infupportably tedious. 

During^thefefedentary employments, Robinfon took pains 
to clear up the darknefs of his friend's under (landing. He 
endeavoured, particularly, to give him juft ideas of the Su- 
preme Being. You will eafily judge how great was Fri- 
day's ignorance and how grofs his errors upon the article of 
religion, from the following dialogue between Robinfon 
and him. 

Robin/on, Tell me, Friday, do you know who made the 
fca, the land, yourfelf, and all living creatures ? 

Friday, Oh, yes, very well. Toupan made every thing. 
Rob. Who is Toupan f 
Frid, He that makes the thunder. 
Rob, Well, then, who is he that makes the thunder ? 
Frid. It Js a very, very old man, that lived before any 
thing elfe in the world, and he makes the thunder. He is 
older than the fun, moon, or /lars ; and all the creatures in 
the world fay O to him (that is, according to Friday's mean- 
ing, worlhip him) . 

Rob. Where do your countrymen go when they die ? 



174 t H f w e w 

Frid. They go to Toupan. 

Rgb. And where is Toupan f 

Frid. He lives upon the high moimt^ns. 

R»b. Has any man eter feen him upon thefe high moun- 
tains ? 

Frid. None but the Owokakeys (that is« the priefts) are 
allowed to go up to him. They fay O to him, and then 
they bring us word what he fays to them. 

Rob. Do thofe enjoy any happinefs who go to him after 
they die ? 

Frid, Oh, certainly^ if diey have killed and eaten a great 
many of their enemies. 

Robinfon fhuddered at this difcovery of an opinion aa 
erroneous as it was barbarous, and from that moment he la- 
boured feriouily to give him juHer notions both of the Su- 
preme Being and of a future ftate. He taught him that God 
is an invifible being, almighty, infinitely wife and good; that 
he created all things, governs and upholds a.11 things ; that 
he himfelf is ^thout beginning, is every where prefent, 
knows all our thoughts, hears our words, and fees all our 
anions ; that he delights in eood and abhors evil, and that 
he will make happy in this life, and in that which is to come» 
thofe who endeavour, with all their heart, and with all their 
ib-ength, to become better and better tvtry day. 

Friday heard thefe fublime and comforting doftrines 
with a refpedlful attention, and lodged them deeply in his 
memory. As the zeal of the mafter to inib*ud was equal to 
the fcholar's defu-e to learn, theJatter was very foon clearly 
convinced of the principal truths of religion, at leaft as far as 
the former was capable of explaining them to him. From 
that moment Friday efleem^ him^lf infinitely happy in 
having been tranfported from his own country to thisifland; 
nor did the refle£lion efcape him, that the intentions of Pro- 
vidence towards him were favouraWein fufferinghim to fall 
into the hands of bis enemies, iince, had it not been for that 
event, he fhould never have known Robinfon. *' Thus,'^ 
added he, '^ I fhould always have lived in ignorance of the 
Being who is all -good and all-powerful." 

Ever afterwards Robinfon accuftomed himfelf to pray hi 
Friday's prefence ; and it would have been an aflTeding flight 
to fee with what joy and devotion mixed the poor Indian re- 
peated the words of his mailer's prayers. They were now 
both of them as happy, in their way of life, as two men can 

be

be who are totally feparated from' the reft of the human 
ipecies. . 

The dull, raitiy feafon pafled away without appearing 
heavy to them. The (ky now cleared ^p, the winds abated, 
the ftormy clouds were difperfed ; Robinfon and his com- 
panion once more breathed the mild and temperate air of 
ipring, and felt their fpirits enlivened afreih : they now, 
therefore, joyfully fet about the important work which they 
had defigned before the r^ns came on. 

Friday, as being head carpenter in this bufinefs, hollowed 
the trunk of the tree by means of fire. This method wa4 
£0 etfctftual and expeditious, that Robinfon could not help 
blaming his own ftupidity for never haying thought of it; 
B^t he fatisfied himfelf by faying,* ** Yet, if I had thought- 
of it, I could not have made.ufe of it, as I had no fire.'* 

You will excufe me from defcribing to you the daily progre(« 
that they made in this work, as an account fo particular would 
have nothing in it cither entertaining or inftru£kive. 1 (hall 
only tell you, that the boat, which Robinfon alone would 
fcarce have finilhed in feveral years, was entirely completed^ 
with the affiftance of Friday, in two months. Nothing was 
3Vanting now but a fail, which Friday undertook to provide, 
and oars, which Robinibn promifed to fumiih* 

Ricif* Ay I how could he make a fail ? He fhould have 
cbth for that. 

, Mr. BilL He certainly did not' know how to make doth ^ 
nor had he a loom ; but, as 1 told yoo before, ho could make 
mats of the bark of trees, and this matting the favages ufe 
for fails. 

Thev both finiihed their tafics nearly at the fame time^ 
Robinfon the oars, and Friday the fail." But now, though 
the canoe was finiihed, it was.fiill to be launched. 

Henry. What is that, papa ? 

Mr. Bill, Were not you with your uncle onc>i to fee a 
(hip launched at Deptford ? 

Htniy. Oh ! yes ; I remember* 

Mr Bill. Then you muft have obferved, that the fhip re&g 
VLpon a hollow frame oT wood-work, which is called the liocks, 
when they ftrike away the fide flays that keep the vefTel 
from moving, it Hides along the frame (which is now called 
the llanchioRs) lAto the water, and this is termed launching 
aihip. 

K ^Uafbnunately, 



17^ T H Z NEW 

Unfortunately > the place where they had made the boat 
was more than half a mile from the lea-fide. How were 
they to get it thither ? Mufl they carry it, or drag it» er 
roll it along.? £ach of thefe v^ys feemed equally impradi«. 
cable ; the canoe was too heavy to be fo managed. What 
are they to do ? Here they were at a full flop : how were 
they to get over it ? 

Eiiw. Why, Robinfon need onlv have made a couple of 
levers^ like that with Which he rolled two great pieces of 
rock out of his cave when he was. all alone* 

Mr> Bill.. He had not forgot the ufe that- might be mader 
of fo fimple an inilrument ; in fad, he had recourfe to it up- . 
on this occafion ; but the method was fo tedious^ that Ro* 
binfon expeded' to be a month before he fhould convey the 
canoe to the fea-fide. Fortunately, he thought of another 
method, to the full as fimple> which is ttf<^ by carpenters 
and other tradefme|i in Europe, for carrying the heavieit 
burthens. They ufe rollers for the purpofe, 

Henry. What are rollers ? 

Mr, BilL They are pieces of wood made long and round^^ 
fometiujbg like a roUing-ilone. They are placed under the 
loads which are to be conveyed fix)m one place to anothen 
A man puilhes the load atone end> which yields without much' 
refinance, and moves on towards the place whither it is to be 
conveyed, the rollers turning under it all die while, as if 
of themfdves. 

Robinfon no fooner made trial of this method, but he wat 
highly pleafed to fee with what eafe and difpatch the boat 
could be moved along, and in two days time it was launched 
in the fea. His joy was doubled when he U\w that it failed 
with the greateil fieadinefs. 

It only remained now to make preparations for thein de«, 
parlure ; that is, to lay in a flock of provifions, as much as

and when he recolIe£ted the fingidar care with which Provi- 
tdence had fupported him in a moft extraordinary manner, 
his heart was moved with gratitude. He (hed tears of joy» 
and, lifting up his hands and eyti to Heaven, he addreffed 
the Almighty with the moil fervent devotion. 

** Oh! heavenly Father, how ihall 1 fufiiciently thank 
thee for all that thou haft hidierto done for me I Unable 
as I am to exprefs in words the whole ardour of my thoughts^ 
fttffer me to manifeft themolfe by the lowly pofture of ado- 
ration. On my knees, or proftrate with my face to the ground, 
or rolling in the duft, let me, as it were, fink into nothing 
before thee. But every thing is open to thy eyes ; thoa 
readefl my heart ; thou feed it filled with inexpreflible /en* 
timents of the ]i¥elicfi; gratitude. This4ieart, which thou 
hail vouchfafed to amend, and which breathes but for thee ; 
this heart, fo often filled with forrow, and fo often Cam** 
forted by thee ; this heart. Oh Lord ! is all that I can offer 
thee in return for tiy innumerable kindnefles : accept it, 
therefore, accept it whole, and finifh the work which thou» 
hail begun in it. Oh ! heavenly Father, receive me in thy 
arms, tg which I commit myfelf vi ith confideace, and diu 
pofe of me according to thy fatherly mercy. May I never 
fbrfake the road of virtue in which thy goodnefs has placed 
me ! Suffer me not. Oh Lord ! to abandon it. In this hope 
I yield inyfelf up to thee ; govern me according to thy wife 
and good pleafure ; I will go wherever thou fhalt condud me. 
I go» with equal tranquillity and confidence in thee, to ex- 
p<% myfelf, perhaps, to frefh dangers. Vouchfafe flill to 
accompany me, and grant me thy invifible, but effe^ual 
fafeguard ! Watch over my immortal foul, and fh-engthen 
it in the trials to which it may be e:q)ofed ! Preferve my 
iieart from weaknefs, impatience, ana ingratitude towards 
thee ! Oh, heavenly and eternal objefl of my foul's love, 
my Creator, my Preferver, my all, my God !" 

Here the* power of utterance yielded in Robinfon to the 
force of his feelings : with his fiice to the ground, he had 
only flrength to weep. Encouraged, however, at length, 
by fecret confolations from above, he rofe up and caft his 
^yes once fnor^ upon the country which he was going to leave, 
and whidb feemed, on that account, to become more dear to 
him. Like a, man who is quitting his native land without

It was the ^oth of November, at eight o^clock in th# 
dBOfiTing, the^hitidityaar of Rdbiitfbn's day upon ^this defer t , 
iiknd, that they fet fail, widi clebr weather and a':&e(h and. . 
^votirable bre&ze. They had 'hardly got a few miles out 
• "Coiiea before'they met with a refef of rock«, 

Marrki. Oh ! dear,, let us know firft whw u reef of rogks 

!lfr. £ili. Seamen give this name to a number of rock» 
Ruined together, and whiter entirely oovered with water, or^ 
tn%)me {3aces, rifing above it. This recff or chain of rocka. 
!Mtadied from avproraiontory of the ifland more than foul^ 
'leagues out into the^fea. It feemed dangerous to fail ovev 
thefe rocks : they, therefore, tacked ; that is, placed theijr 
fail in another portion, that, by taking afweep roundy they 
might.geton the oiitfide of the reef. 

Edw. But if the water covered this reef, how could the/ 
know how far it reached into the fea ? 

Air. BiU^ They couU judge of that b; the waves whi«h 



l80 T H K N 1 W 

tliev faw break over it ; for in places where there arc hiddeit 
rocks under the water, the waves rife higher, and appear 
whiter with foam, becaofe thefe rocks/ in flopping them, 
make them ri(e and break them* 

Scarce had they gained the outmoft point of the reef, 
when, all at once, their canoe was carried away with as 
much rapidity as if they had many fails fei and went before 
a ftrong gale of wind. They were both terrified, and made 
hafte to furl their fail, becaufe they thought they had been 
furprifed by a fmart breeze. But this was in vain.; for 
the canoe was carried over the billows^ no lefs rapidly than 
t>efbre ; and from thence they concluded that -they were in 

. Ae middle of a ilrong current, which forced them along. * 
Hinty, What ! arc there currents in the fea ? 
Mn BiiL The bottom of the fea is no lefs rugged and 
imeven than the furface of the land t and under t& water 
there are mountains, hills, and vallies, as well as upon land. 

^ New, the water naturally runs with more fwiftnels towards 
the parts that are lower ; whence it comes to pais, that there 
are currents in the fea as large as the Thames, and often 

^ exceedingly rapid. It is very dangerous for fmaU boats to 
fall intouefe currents, becaufe they find it difficult, not to 

., fay impoffible, to get out of them again ; fo that Uiey arc 
frequently carried a hundred leagues out of their courfe. 
Rich. Ah ! poor Robinfon, what is to become of you 

. now ? 

Harriet. Why did he not flay in his ifland? I dioogfat 
foxAething would happen to him. 

Mr. BilL In undertaking this voyage, he cannot be ac- 
dufed either of levity or raSinefs. He was moved to it by 
reafons of the greatefl prudence, and moft maturely weighed. 
Whatever happens to him now, he may look upon as a de- 
cree of Providence, and to that he refigns himfelf entirely. 
They tri^d, in vain, to force themfelves out of thexur- 

■ rent by rowing : an irrefiflible power carried them along 

. with the fwiftnefs of an arrow ; and they were now fo i^ 
out at fea as to have loft fight of the coail of their ifland. 
Their defbru£tion appeared inevitable ; for, in lefs than half 

. an hour more, they would lofe ftghtof the tops of the higheft 
hills upon the ifland : after that, let the impetuofity of the 
current ceafe fooncr or later, it was all over with them s for 
they could not poflibly recover the ifland,^ having no com- 

^|a^ 'i9 dire^ their coarfe.

briefly reminded him of .all dxat he had ahreadjr tai^Kt Mm 
upon this fubjca:. •« Is it only upon land," faidhe, " that 
we are in the hands of the Almighty ? Is he not alfo maf- 
ter of the ocean? If he thinks right, can 'he not order 
thcfe waves, which are now fo dangerous to us, to carry 
us to a place of fafety ? Do you thmk, that, by throwing 
yourfclf into the fea, you could efcSpe from the lot to which 
he has deftined you? Learn, indoniiderate yoi;mg man« 
that your immortal foul will, during eternity, be under 
the boundlefs empire of the Almighty, and that it cannot 
hope for happinefs, if, rebellious toits fovereign, it connterafb 
his orders, by confenting violently to break the bonds which 
luiite it to the body." 

Friday was fenfibly affefted with the troth of thefe whole- 
^me exhortations, and bkilhed for his own weakneTs. He 
immediately took upi his oar again, and they both condnued 
^ row, although they had not the fmalleft hope that all their 
efforts could fave them. Robinfon faid, ** We are but do- 
ing bur duty; for while we have a fpark of life remaining,^ 
we are bound to do every thing in otir power to iave it* 
vJf we fail, we die with the comfortable aflurance that fuch 
' is the will of the Supreme Being ; and his will, my dear 
hiend," ^ded he, raifing his voice to a tone of generous 
animation, " his will is ever wife, even when we» miferabi^ 
Vt'orms, c^not interpret it." 

The rapidity of the current continued ftill the fame : they 
could now fee no more of the iiland than the tops of the 
^ills ; ai}d now, even of them, they could difcover but one,, 
the very highcft, and that was lei&ning to their viewvcry 
h& I in ihort, all hope of being faved was vanifhed*^ 

But when all human aMance fails, when the diilrelk of 
Ahe unfortunate is at its height, then, my dear children^, 
then comes in aid the powerful hand of Hkn who governs aA 
things ; and the man who was on the point of periihiag, is 
placed wholly out of danger, by means which he never won^ 
have fbrefeen. This appeared in the prefent critical moment. 
Jtobinfon had loH ail hope of avoiding a ipeedy death ; bat» 
at die very moment when, exhauft^ with hvgat, he waa. 
obliged to ceafe rowing, he perceived, that the fwStnefs of the 
Iboat's motion abated all at once.; he ob(enred.|dib tliat the 
water did not ajmear fo mnddy as before; and> cafting hiS: 
eyes over the furface of the fea, he £uther reinarked that the

whidi ran violently towards the North, while the other, Icfa^ 
sapid, turned iOhort t6 the South; and in this latter the canoe 
fcagpened to take its courfe. 

Tranfportcd with joy, he addreffes himfelf to his compa- 
nion, who was half dead with feaiu '* Courage, Friday! 
It is the will of Heaven that we ihall ftill be prererved!'* Ani^ 
snmediately he pointed out to him the circumilances upon 
which he founded his hope. They both, therefore, took up* 
their oars a^^ain, which ^tigue hail made them let go. Re- 
animated with the fweet and unexpeAed hope of efcaping: 
firom death, they exerted their laft efforts to get out of the 
current, and.iaw,.with infinite fatisfadlion, that, for once, theic 
labour was not ineffedual. Robinfon> who, from a long feriet* 
of difappointmentSy was accuftomed to fot ntnhing flip his 
attention,; obierved,. at this moment,, that the wind would be 
.©f fervice to them; he, therefore, quickly unfurled the faiJv.» 
which, catching the breeze,. helped,^ together with their re- 
doubled exertions in rowing,, to carry them very foon out 
of the currant into> a finooth fea; 

Friday was ready to jump for joy } he rofe up to embrace- 
his mafter, who, however, begged him to fufpend his tranf-^ 
ports for a moment, as there remained a»good deal ftill to b^* 
done before they could think themfelves completely out Of' 
danger, in faft,, thcylbd been<carried out to fea fo far„ 
that they, couldbarely perceive their iHand^Jike a very fmatt

Robinfon made hade to feel all round the canse wfth h».

Mr, Bill. So true it is that God hzs engraven in. the 
hearts of all men principles of afiedion and gratitude to 
their parents. Alas ! what a horrible monikr muft that 
man be, if it were poffible for fuch to exift amongft us 
civilized beings, who fhould ftifle in his heart thefe firft 
workings of nature, who (hould feel no more than indiffer- 
ence for his parents, and who fhould knowingly give them 
caufe of forrow and vexation ! If ever you meet with 
fueh a monfter, my dear children, remain not with him un- 
der the fame roof; avoid him, he i^ the peft of fociety ; he 
is capable of the moft dreadful crimes> and will not ful to 
experience the terrible efFe6b of heavenly vengeance. 

When the tranfports of Friday's joy were a Utile calmed> 
Rdbinfon a(ked him if he knew the paiTage over to his fa- ^ 
ther's ifland fo. well as to be certain, that, if they under- 
. took it^ they fEould not be expofed to dangers Uke thofe 
which they had experienced the day before. Friday af- 
fured him that he knew the paiTage perfectly, and would 
undertake it with confidence even by night; Uiat he had 
failed it feveral times with his countrymen^ when they 
came to this ifland tafeail after their viaories. 

R06. Then you were amongftthem when they killed mea 
and ate them? 
Fru Certainly. 

Rolf. And vou^took your fliare with them too ? 
FrL Alas ! I knew not that there uas any harm in it; 
Roh. On which fide of the ifland did you generally 
land? 

Fri. Always on the South fide, as being neareft to our 
ifland, and alfo becaufe cocoa-nuts are to be found ther« 
in plenty. ■ 

This^ was an additional proof to RobinTon that he had 
^ood caufe to thank God for having fuffered him to be 
Siipwrecked rather upon the Northern coafl than ^e 
Southern, as, in this latter cafe> he would foon have fallen 
a prey to the favages. He then repeated his promiie to 
Friday that he wOuld flK>rtly crofs over with him to hia 
ifland, and endeavour to find his father.. He made him 
fenfible, however, that this was Qot to be done immediately* 
as the prefent feafon was predfely the fisaibn for working in 
the garden* and this important bufiaeft would by no me^ns 
permit them to be abfent. 
They* thefeforex.Xet about this work without delay. 



^Robmiba md Fridty ftrove to fiirpafs each other in the srt 
^f digging. During the kitervais of reft, they employed 
themfelves in finding oot means to improve their gardening 
tools. Robinibny wnofe patience and invention were eqnaHy 
inexhauftible, fucceeded in making a rake, thongh he hid 
tio more than a fharp-pointed fione to make the mles which 
vrere to receive the teeth : from the nature of -the xnflru- 
•ment that he ufed, one may guefs how long he was in 
making them. Friday, for lus pan, contrived with a (harp 
ftone to make two fpades of fo very hard a wood, that they 
> Were nearly of the fame ilrength and efFefl as if they hflfl 
been made cf iron. 

Robmfon was not content with providing merely for his 
^wants ; he thonght of making fome improvements abdut 
"hk habitation, and, by degrees, of ornamenting it. Sndi, 
my deaf children, has ever been the natural confeqt»nceX)f 
2dlie projfrefs ef the arts. Wiiile men weneobli^ed to think 
6f nothing; but the meant of providing lor their fdbfiftente

arts which ferve merely to adorn the objeifts that furrouad 
them, or to proovre them tpleafures more rdined dmn t^e 
Iddieh they enjoy in common with other animals ; but no 
fooner were they aiTured of their fubfillence and iafety, than 
they fought to unite the agreeable with the Tieceffary, th» 
beautiful with the lifeftil. Hence arafe, and. Were |;xadu«

pretty broad walks, which he marked out with a line. He 
■planted hedge*rows, and made fumm^4u>ufes and dark 
wifclks. One quarter was deiigned for & flower garden, 
>4nother for a kitchen garden, and the third for an orchard » 
l^his lafl he enriched with all the befl of die young lemon

which he ufed very dexterouily in carving wood, the work 

. of which feemed almoft as well executed as if it hid been 

cut with iron« For indance, having found a long bone, hie 

made a chifel of it ; of a branch of coral he nu^e a rafp ; 

a knife he made out of a fliell, and a file of a.fiih's ikin. 

With thefe tools he provided for their apartment many .little 

, pieces of furniture, which contnbuted to render tiieir fitu- 

ation much more commodious. 

^ The art of reducing; the fruit of the bread-tree into a 

. kind of paile or dough, was of the greateft importance. 

This pafte was as nouiiihing as our bread, and had neatly 

the fame tade. The favages ufe this pafte raw, but Ro- 

binfon gave it a little toamng on the fire, which made it 

. eat almoft as agreeable as an^ bread. 

He lesuned, alfo, from Friday, the ufe of the chocolate- 
nuts, which having formerly found in one of his excuriions, . 
he had brought home a fmall ftock of them for trial. When 
they were roafted before the fire, they afforded a food very 
agreeable to die tafte> and as wholefome as it was nqu- 
rifliing. 

Robinfon, who was fond of making experiments, pounded 

a few handfuls of thefe nuts between two flat (lones, and^ 

baving reduced them to powder, he boiled them with milk*

From this time they began to undertake longer and more 
frequent excurfions all over the ifland, particularly whea 
they obferved that the wind was unfavourable for the &* 
vages to come over. In thefe excurfions they made feve« 
raldiicoTeries which they eafily turned to their advan-

henfions to his fiiend. Friday protefted to him, hy every- 
thing the moft facredj that thefe fears were ill-founded ; 
that he knew his countrymen well etiough to aflure him 
Hsat they were incapable of ufing thofe ill who were not 
their enemies. Robinfon was convinced that Friday would 
by no means fpeak fo poiliiveIy» if there was the fmallefl:' 
room for doubt. He» therefore, baniihed all fear and fuf- 
picion> depended upon Friday's good faith, and refolved to 
fet fail the very next day. 

With this intention they again floated their canoCf which 
had been drawn up on the beach, and moored it to a ftake' 
fixed in the ground. The fame evening they roalled a 
quantity of potatoes, and prepared other provifions, in- 
tending to lay in a Hock for at leaft eight. days. Friday 
ihewed upon this occadon that he was not ignorant in the' . 
art of cookery. As they had jud killed a young lama, he 
propofedto his mafter a method of roading it whole in lefa 
time than they could on the fpir, and he engaged that its 
flefli (hould eat more tender and juicy when drelt after this 
manner. He went to work thus : 

He dug a hole in the ground about two feet deep ; this 
he filled with feveral layers alternately of dry wood and 
flat fiones. Here he made the fire, over which he held 
the lama, to (inge it, or burn its hair entirely off : he then 
fcraped it with a (hell, and made it as clean as if it had 
been-fcalded in boiling water. With the fame (hell be cut 
it open, and then took out the bowels. In the mean time 
the wood was burnt to charcoal, the hole was completely 
heated, and the ftones rtd hot. He took out the wood and 
tbe ftones as faft as pofiible, only leaving as many of the 
latter as were fufficient to cover the bottom of the hole» 
On th^fe fiones he fpread a layer of leaves of the cocoa- 
nut-tree, and on thefe leaves placed the lama> which he 
covered again with other leaves; and, laftly, over thefe he 
laid what remained of the hot ftones. The whole was co- 
vered with earth. .

they would fiod^a fiife refuge upon that ifland; for he had. 
not the leafi doubt that there was fome ilup in difbefs near

was a iigDal of their danger, fiat fcarce had the fire htgxm, 
to blaze up before there came fuch a ihower of rain as putr 
itiOut in a moment. Robinfon aod Friday were obliged cp. 
baften to the cavcj for fear of being-carried away 1^ the 
water, which ran in floods*. The whiftling of the wind> 
the roaring of the waves» the loud burfts of thunder, all 
found with redoubled tumult ; and though « in the midft of'

be could diftinguiih.now and then fome reports of cannon» 
yet he doubted whether tfaey might not be the burfting of: 
thunder ac a diftance. However, notwithftanding his. 
doubts, he indnlged himfelf with the flattering thought that 
there might be a ihip near at hand, the captain of whicb» 
if he efcaped the danger of this dreadful fiorm, might take 
bim and his faithful' Friday, on board/ and carry them to 
Europe. Ten times he attempted to light the fire, and tea*

pended between bope and fear, went to the fea-lidey ac* 
companied by Friday, to afcertain whether his coojedures 
were well or ill founded* But the firft difcoTery that they 
made filled Robinibn with grief, and almoft plunged Friday 
into defpair. The wind had driven their boat 6ut to fea. 
It would have melted any one with'compaffion to be wit- 
oefa of Friday's exceffive grief, when he faw bimfelf dif^ 
appointed in the pleaGng hope of foon returning to hia 
father. His natural complexion forfook his face, and was 
fucceeded by a ghaftly palenefs : he coul^ not utter a (ingle 
word; his eyes were mournfully fixed upon the ground; 
his whole body was agit«ited as if bis foul were firivtng to 
part from it, and to break the bonds which held them 
united. Suddenly bis grief burfts forth in a fiood of tears, 
nnd he beats his breaft and tears his hair, fobbing all the 
while as if his heart would break. 

^obinfon had learned, from his own misfortunes, to feel 
lor thofe of others, and particularly to calm and footh the 
ibrrows of the afilifted. He was touched with Friday's - 
excefs of grief; he felt for his fittiation, and endeavoured 
to comfort him by exhortations full of rendernefs and cood 
ienfe. *• Who knows/' faid he, *' whether the lofsof our 
canoe may not be for our advantage ? Or who can tell of 
what fervice this florm, which has carried away our boat, 
may be in its cooiecjuences either to us or to others ?'* 
•* What fervice !" faid Friday tartly ; ** it has deprived us 
of our canoe, that is all." 

*' Then becaufe neither you nor I, narrow-minded, 
{faort-fighted beings as we are, can perceive any other ef* 
te£l of the fiorm than the \ofs of our canoe, do you fup- 
pofe that God, whofe wifdom is unbounded, had no other 
purpoie in view when he ftirr^d up this tempeft^ How

. Friday, recovering his compofure, was afham^d of his er- 
ror, repented of his murmurs, and fubmitted to the decree of 
Providence. In the m6an time, Robinfon did nqt ceafe 
to caft his eyes round to every part of the vaft ocean that was 
open to his view ; he could not help looking out for fbme 
vciFel; but there was not the fmalleil appearance of one.. 
He concluded, therefore, that he had been miilaken, sind 
that what he had fuppofed to be the report of guns had 
certainly been thunder. Grieved at the thought of giving 
up fb agreeable a hope, he returned forrswfully towards hm 
habitation. ^ x . 

fiut even here he was not at eafe : his fanpy (Hll ran upon 
a veifel at anchor near the ifland. He went up, therefore^ 
to the top of the hillock, from whence there was a full vieiv 
of all the Wcftem coaft, but he could difcern nothing that 
flattered his hopes. Still vexed and uneaiy, he went to a 
very high hill, from the top of which he could view th« 
Eaftern coaft, and cli0#)infi; with all ipeed up to the fummit, hft 
cafts hi< eves round the iea — But heavens ! what is his joy 
when he oiicovers that he has not been miftaken ! 

rAeCiuUrem. Oh dear! 

Mr. Bili.Heiecs a (hip, and, notwithftanding the didances 
he fees it fo diftindly as to l^e convinced that it is one^ 
and of pretty large burthen. You will excufe me, my deai-s, 
if I . forbear attempting to defcribe the exoefiive transports 
of his joy. He Hies like lightning to his cave, and arrives quite 
out of breath. He fnatcbes up his arms, without which he 
never went to any great diftance, and, unable to fay any 
more to Fridny, who- was aftoniQied to fee him in fuch a 
harryj than thde words ** There they are ! quick I quick !*•

taking up kis arms, iherefbre, he followed him with all 

They had at leall twelve miles to go before they came 
to that part of the ihore off which the vefTel ieemed to lie at 
anchor ; nor did Friday learn the caufe of hb mailer's hurry 
until he arrived at this fpot. Robinfon (hewed him the fliip 
9tL a difbince. Friday could not conceal his adoniihment ; 
for, notu ithltanding the diiiance, he guefled it mufl be at 
leaft a hundred times bigger than any thing which he had 
ever feen of the kind. 

Kobinibn exprefled his joy in a thodand different ways j 
ibmetimes he danced, fometiines he halloo'd, and fometimes 
he embraced Friday with tears in his eyes, and congratulated 
the good fortune of both. Now, indeed, they fliould fet 
oiF/or Europe, and come to England i Now Friday fhould 
(ec how the people live in that country \ what houfes they 
inhabit, and how they pafs their time in peace, enjoying all 
Ae conveniencies and pleafures of life! Thus h^ ran on with- 
out Hopping, and would perhaps have talked for an hour, 
had he not recollected, that to lofe the precious time in ufe- 
lefs words wr.s now particulariy unreafonable, and that he 
ought, by every method in his power, to endeavour to make 
himfelf vifible to the people in the fhip. But how was this 
to be done ? Here was what puzzled him. 

He endeavoured to make them hear him, but to no pur- 
rofe, though the wind had changed during the florm, and 
bjew, at prefent, off the iiland towards the (hip. He then 
begged his friend to make a fire dire^ly, which might be 
ieen by the people on board. This was quickly done; and 
^ey iaiidled a blaze that rofe as high as the tops of the 
ftrtes. Ue had his eyes conibnxly fixed upon the fhip, ex- 
peeing every moment to fee them lower a boat, and fend it 
towards- the ihare» But his expedations uere all in vaia. 

At lad, as the ^re had been lighted now more than an 
ikmr without any appearance of a boat, Friday oSered to 
livim to the iiip# notwithftandinc^ its diftance^ and invite the 
crew to come on fhore. Robinfon jovfuUy confented to thfti» 
on condition, however, that he (bouid take care not to expole 
himfelf rafhly 9 nor aegle6t any thing for the prefervation 
of his life. Imme^tely Friday flrips off his doaths of 
matting, cuts a branch, and^ holding it between his teeth« 
fprings boldly into the waves. Robinfon accompanied him 
with his eyefi and moft fricadly wifiies.

Cbwlotte. But why the branch, papa ? 

Mr, Bill* A green branch is, among the favagcs, a Hg/i 
of peace. He who approaches them with a bough ui hk 
hand, has nothing to fear from them. It was for hii. fecu- 
rity, therefore, that Friday took this precaution. 

He arrived fafe at the veflel, and fwam round it twice or 
thrice, calling the peopk, bot nobody anfwercd. Perceiving 
the ladder at the (hip's fide, he went up by it, holding the 
branch in his hand. . 

When he was high enough to fee all over die deck, he was 
frightened at the fight of an animal, fuch as he had never 
fcen in his lifij ; it was covered with black woolly hair, and 
as foon as it faw Friday, it uttered fuch noiies as perfeftly 
furprifed him. However, it foon ceafiid crying out, and 
appeared fo mild and fo engaging, that Friday was now no- 
longer afraid of it : the creature approached in a manner 
fo humble, and, crept alcmg wagging its tail and whining fo 
plaintively, that Friday fuppoied it to be chtrcatiftp: his ht*Ip 
iind protcfUon. When it had crept clofc up to lu;i>, aid 
ftopped, Friday ventured to pat it, and the creature feemed 
tranfported with joy. Friday walked over the deck, calling 
the people, but nobody appeared. While he was loft in ad- 
mira'ion of the many furprifing objeds that he faw on the 
deck, and was ftanduie with his back to the hatch-way, he 
received, all of a fudden, fo violent a blow behind^ that he 
fell flat on his face. Getting up in a great fright, he looks 
round him, and ftands petrified with confternation, on be- 
llolding a creature of a pretty large (ize, with crooked horns^ 
and a long bufhy beard, rearing itfelf upon its hind legs, and 
preparing, with a threatening air, to make a fecond attack 
upon him. Friday roared out as loud as he was able, a^id 
jumped into the fea. 

The firA of tbcfe animals, which was black, and which I 
need not name, as, no doubt, you know what it is, from 
the defcription that 1 have given you^f it 

Ruh^ Oh ! it was a water fpaniel. 

Mr. BtU. You have guefTed it, Thefpanirf, in imitati<» 
of Friday, jumps alfo into the water,, and fwims after him. 
Friday, hearing the noifc of fbmethmg that fell into the water 
behind him, imagined the horned monfter to be purfuing 
him. He was fo terrified at the thought, that he was fcarce 
able to fwim, and ran great danger of drowning : a frefh 
. Inilance from. which we &e how hurtfUl the gaffion of fbar \s».

iince it harries as into dangers to which we ftoald never be 
expofedj if we did not fuffer oarfelves to be overpowered 
by it. 

, He did not even dare to loirff behind him : however, after 
he had a little recovered from his fright, he fwam fo faft that 
the fpaniel could fcarcely keep up with him. When he 
reached the fhore, being unable tofpeak^hq fell down quite 
fpent at Robinfon's feet. The fpaniel landed a few minutes 
after. 

Robinfon Iparedno pains to bring his faithful companion 
to himfelf. He rubbed his temples, fhook him> and called 
him aloud by his name. But it was fome tim^before Friday 
opened his eyes and fpoke. As foon as he was able, he be- 
•gan to relate the terrible adventure that had happened to 
him ; how the fhip appeared to him a great mountain of 
wood, on which flood up three large trees (meaning the 
mails); how the black creature had (hewn him a thoufand 
marks of fondnefs ; and how the monger with the beard aiid 
horns had attempted to kill him : laflly, he added, that he 
believed the monfler to be mailer of the floating mountam 
of wood, as he faw no man on it. * 

Robinfon liflened to him with a good deal of fnrprife. 
The horned moniler he fuppofed to be a goat. As to t)i^. 
ihip, he concluded that it was faft upon a rock or fknd bank> 
^nd that the crew, fearing to be wrecked, had quitted it, 
ai^i taken to their boats for fafety, but he could not con- 
ceive what was become of them. If they had reached the 
ifland, the fpot where he then flood with Friday was the moft 
likely place for their landing ; but he could perceive no traces 
of them. If they had periflied, yet either their bodies or 
their boats, or both, would, in all probability, have been 
thrown upon fome part of the fhore. However, at length, 
he recolledled that the wind had changed during the florm, 
and, from an Eaflerly gale, had fhifted fuddenlv to the Weft. 
This circumflance feemed to explain to him what he found 
fo much difficulty in comprehending at firfl. 

" Certainly," faid he to himfelf, " the people who took 
10 their boats maft have been driven back by the Wefterly 
gale from reaching this fhore ; the wind mufl have carried 
them Eaflward ; fo that, perhaps,^ they have perifhed in the 
open fea ; perhaps they were carried away by fome current; 
or, perhaps, before the fliiftinc; of the wind, they mig^ 
kave touched on one of the iOands to the Weftward. Heaven

thou^t it-notin^probable.

in either cafe we can 'do nothing better than unload the ihip 
of whatever ejFe£b we can move. But how are we to attempt 
this now that we have no canoe ?" At that moment he felt 
for the lofs of his canoe almoftas much as Friday had a few 
hours before ; he thought of every method poUible either to 
replace it, or to fubftiTute fomething clfe in its room, but 
he was a long time-without hitting upon any thing th^t would 
anfwer. To build another canoe, would take up too much 
time. To fwim to the fhip, was ah attempt that he durfl 
not undertake on account of the diltance. Befides, what 
could he expedt to fave by doing fo i" 

Rich, I know very well what I would have done.

Mr, BilL That was precifely die idea that flruck Robin -

Hi»ry. Now, vv4iat is a raft ? 

Rich, A raft is a number of beams tied clofe*together»'fo 
that one can walk upon them, and this will earsy you up^n 
the water as well as a boat.' 

Mr, Bill. You arc very right ; and juft foch a raft did 
Robinfon intend to make to carry him to -the fhip> that )ie 
might fave whatever goods he oould bring away. It was rc«- 
fblved that x)ne of them fliould go to the cave and bring back 
provifions for a day, as well as all the cordage and tools that 
he ihould find. As Friday was the more adive of the two, 
he was charged with this buiinefs ; and while he performed 
it, Robinfon cut doWn trees proper for the raft. 

Friday could not be back before nightfall : in the meiin 
time Robinfon was much delighted with thej[paniel| ibr whkh 
be felt a kind regard as coming 'from Europe. 

Thefpaniel, for its part, feemed perfeftly happy in meet>» 
ing with fo good a matter,, and played a number of amufoig 
tricks before Robinfon. At FricuCy's return, Robinfon gave 
the fpaniel part of his fupjper, though this was the firH food

TWENTY-FOITRTH SVEKING. 



Ji/fR' Bili Scarce had the ruddv inorning begun to appear 

in the Eaftern part of the horizon, when the wakeful 

Robinfen roofed his companion to go on with the work which 

' they had begun the day before. They worked fo ince&ntly 

the whde da}^, that the raft was finifhed that very evening. 

They had joined a double row of trunks oi trees together 
in fudi a manner with cords and willow twigs, that it fcurmed, 
as it were, a fblid floor, fit to lie. even On the water, and 
about twenty feet long, with nearly the fame breadth. They 
had alfo been careful to confb-ud this raft ujpon rollers cloie 
to the beach, that they might the more eauly fet it afloat 
without lofs of time. 

Fortunately, the tide was on the ebb about break of day. 
Hiey did not delay a moment in launching their raft, that 
xkey might have the advantage of the ebb, which, like a 
current, would carry them out towards the (hip. They pnfh 
oflr,are now upon the open fea, and in lefa than half an hour 
come alongiiae of the ihip. 

What were Robinfon's feelings when he approached this 
European veflel! He would have kifl!ed it, and glued his 
lips to every part of it if pofiible ! That it came from Europe,

wcrexircumfiances which could not fail to render it dear to 
him. But,.alas I thefe Europeans ihemfelves had difappeared 
—perhaps had been fwallowed up by the waves; anafflidliqg 
furmife to Robinfon, who would cheerfully have iacri .Iced 
half of the days that he had ftill lo live, on condition of find- 
ing the. crew, and fetting fail with them for Europe. But 
^s he was obliged to give up this hope, it only remained for 
him now to fave as much of the goods out of the Ihip as he 
could for his own ufe. 

Geo. But could he take EofTeflion of goods that did not be*, 
long to him ?. 

Mr^ BilL What think jr^«, Richard, could he do foP 

Rich. He might, to be fure, take them out of the (hip,, 
and carry them afhore ; but if the owners appeared,. he Was^ 
'obliged, to reftorcL them- 

Mr. 5///. Thus juilice decrees certainly. If he did not 
take out the goods, they would be fpoiled by degrees in. 
the fea-water ;. he had, therefore, fome right to tlie u& of. 
them ; he might, without any fcruple, take. to himfcif what- 
ever he found moft neceffary, and keep it,, looking upon it: 
as a recompenfe, which the owners, if ever th«;y appeared,, 
could not juilly refufe him for the trouble iba^.he had takeni 
in faving the remainder of the cargo. v

it has been regulated in fome countries^ that the third jpart 
of ihipwrecked goods (hould belong to the fovereign of the

When Robinfon was a Kttle recovered &om the excefs of jp7 
which he felt at the fi^t of an European Ihip, his firft wilh 
was that it might not prove to be damaged, but capable of 
beinjg fet afloat. In this cafe he was refolved to embark in 
it with Friday, and fet fail> if not for Europe, at leaf! for

^t he muft never expcdl: to fee it afloat again. 

The ilorm-had lodged it between two rocks, where it was 
jammed in fo faft, that there was not the leaft poflibility of 
novingitone way or the other, and it was likely to remain

him his ufual food> h« had received little or no nouiifhment. 
Kobinfon, who fufpefied this to be the cafe the moment he 
tsLW the animal's enfeebled flate, made it his fiiil care to feek. 
for fomething to apfjeafe its hunger. As he was very welt 
acqiudnted with the iniide of a fhip^ he was not long in find^ 
ing what he fottght* and had the pLsafure to fee the goat de« 
▼our with the greateft ea^ernefs what he broueht it ; while 
Friday, for Ms part, cou& never fufficiently admire the odd 
figure of the anmial, as he thought it^^ having never feen 
any thine like it before. 

Robii&n began next to take a (iirvey of the fhijp ; he went 
from deck to deck, and. from cabin to cabin^and round every 
where a thoufand things, which, in £urepe> one would fcarce 
think worth looking atj^ but which to him were of infinite 
importance* In one part was a flock of bifcuit> rice,, flour* 
com, wine,, gunpowder, balls, fhot; in another place 
were (hip cannon^ mufkets, piftols, fwords> hangers, and. 
catlafles; elfcwhere tliere were hatchets, faws, pincers>. 
gimlets^ rafps^ planes^ hammers, iron bafs, nails, knives, 
iaSaxs, needles^ and pins. Farther on, he fees pots, por- 
ringers, iJates> (boons, tongs^ bellows, fire-ihovels, and a> 
ther kitchen uteufils, fomeof wood, others of iron, tin, and 
copper* Lafily, he finds chefis full of cloaths, linen, dock- 
ings, fhoes, boots, and a number of other things, for any 
iingle one of whidi, if it had been offered to him for fale,. 
RobinfoD would freely have given his lump of gpld, which 
he had long fince forgotten* 

Friday was loik in amaze at the figfit of lb many Qbje!%; 
all equally unknown to him, and the u&s of which, he cotud 
not fo much as guefs.. Robinfon, on the other hand, could 
Bot contain himtelf ; he wept for joy : like a chird,shc touched 
every thing, fnatched up every thing, but laid it down as^. 
Ibon as he faw any thing elfe that he liked better. He was 
going, at laft, down to the hold, but found a confiderable 
quantity of water in it i a proof that there wa^ a leak uti

He confidered what he had' bed carryiathore in this Eis

Now he thought one thing moftindifpenfably neceflary, now

Mr, Bill. That is verjr true, Henrv ; but the goat couli 
not fo well have done widioot him. Robinfon was too com- 
jpaiEanate to leave the poor creature cxpofed to the Sanger, 
of periihing with the fhip, which mighc be funk before he 
came back. Befides, there was room, for her (for it was a. 
fliegoat) on the raft after it bad been loaded with every thing 
that feemedto claim his greateft regard. No! he did not. 
forget the poor goat — he carried her with Tiim. 

But he, difdained to take many articles n hich m Enhipe 
WiOuld have been eagerly feized the firH of all. A barrel of 
gold duft,. and aca&et of the moft valuable diamonds,, he 
found amongft the captain's efFedls, but was in no wife temptj 
€d to tak6 tiliem,away,, as they could not polTibly be of any 
fervice to him. 

He had employed fo much time in .examining the (hip, in 
opening and emptying the chefts, in indulging his joy and 
admiration, in. chufmg and placing upon the raft what he 
bad a mind to carry away,, that, when all was done, he had 
only an hour, to fpare before the tide would begin to (low 
a^n« They were obliged to take the advantage of it ;. for, 
without the flow of .the tide,, they would. hardly be able to 

§ain the fhore. Robinfon. fpent this hour in dining after

before. 

He brought out, therefore, ;a piece of hung beef, a few 
]ierrin|;s,. fome bifcuir,,butter, cheefe, and a bottle of wine, 
' and laid the whole upon a table in tlxe cabin. Friday and 
he fat down upon. chairs,. The very circura/bince of dining 
at SL table, fitting upon chairs, .having plates, helping tliem- 
&lves with knives and forks ; in (hort, of making a meal

>iot to mention the vKtuals* particulaxly the bread, which 
iad been fo often in vain the objed of hb wifhes. You can- 
not imagine how delicious they tailed to his palate. One 
ihould, like him, be deprived for nine years lucce^vely of 
all thofe forts of food, and all thofe conveniencies, in order 
10 conceive, in its full extent, the luxury that he enjoyed. 

Friday, who knewnotlungofthe European manner of eat- 
ing, was very much puzzled in handling his knife, and flQI 
•more his fork. Robmfon (hewed him how to ufe them ; but 
Friday, endeavouring to imitate him, and to put a bit of 
meat mto his mouth with the fork, from pure habit lifted up. 
Iiis hand witb the handle of the fork to his li^s, while the 
piece of meat went off towards his ear. Robinfon having 
snade Friday tafle the wine, he firmly refufed to drink soff 
of it : accuflomed, as he was, to fpring water, his palate 
could not bear the fiery ftrength of a fermented liquor. The 
l)ifcuit, on the other hand, was quite to his tafle. 
. The tide now beginning to flow., they get i^n the raft^ 
puih off, and are carried gently towards the ifland. In^a 
fiiort time they come to fhore, and haHen to land the goods 
with wluch the raft was loaded. 

Friday was very curious to know the meaning of all- thofe • 
tlmug^s and their ufes. To begin to fatisfy his cuxiofity, Ro- 
bin&n redres behind a buih, and dreffes himfelf in a ihict>. 
ftoc^gs, and (hoes, togedier with an officer's uniform 
complete ; then, putting a. laced hat upon his head, and a. 
fword by his fide, he comes, all at once, and ihews himfelf 
to Friday. Seized with aflxmifkment, Friday Harts, back .a 
few paces, doubting, at firfl fight, whether it were really his 
xnafter, or fome bem^ above the human fpeciea. Robinfon 
could not help laughmg at his amazement ; he held his hand 
out to him in a friendly manner, affuring him that he was 
ffiU the fame^ ftill Ms friend Robinfon, though he bad un- 
dergone a change of drefs, and, in fome meafure, offortunc. 
He gave him a fuit of failor's doaths, fhewed him the ufe^of 
each part, and defured him alio to retire behind the thicket 
and change his drefs. 

Friday went accordingly ; but, how long was he dreflingl 
and how many trials dicfhe make ! He ^ut on each, part o£ 
tiie drefs wrong : for inftance, he put ms two legs through

He jumped for joy, like a cnild, when he faw how wcB 
he was doathed, how convenient and eafy this drefs was C2> 
the body, and how proper to defend him from the flings of 
muikitoes. The fhoes alone were difagreeable to him ; He 
thought them inconvenient and ufelefs. He begged Ieave« 
t^erdfore^ to put them ofF^ and Robinfon gave him full per<- 
miflion to db m that refpe^ whatever he preafed. 

He alfo (hewed him the ufe of the hatchers anrT fevecal 
other tools, with which he was quite delighted. They Be* 
gan to make immediate ufe of them, in cutting a matt fo' 
their raft, that, with the help of a (ail, they might> for the 
future, be able to go to and from the (hip wiuiont being

he took hiis matter for Toupan. He raifed himfelf up on his

■ Things, for the bleflings that he had vouaifafed him ! ^ipr 
was he content with feeling thefe fentiments of gratitude 
hirofelf ; he endeavoured alio to communicate them to Fa- 
day. With this view, he taught him, before they went to 
reft, a prayer^ of thahkfgiviag, which they both repeated 
with {bftened and grateful hearts, to the praiie of the Su- 
preme Being, the Univerfal Father of Nature. 

The next moriDing they rofe pretty early, and carried all 
their goods into a coppice, where they covered them with 
boughs of trees to fecure them .from the rain if it fhould fall, 
and then fet 9S with the firil ebb to return to the u reck. 

I forgot to tell you that they hid provided themfelves 
with oars, fo that this trip was made in much Itfs time than 
the former, and to the full as fortunately. They took care, 
in the firil place, to lower dovi n upon their raft all the planks 
that they could find in the fhip, with which they might cover 
the raft as it were with another floor, and (6 keep the gooda 
much drier than thofe uhich they had carried away the day 
before. 

Robinfon examined the cargo afrefh, to ehufe Whatever h^ 
fliould think preferable in fo great a quantity of goods, which 
he could not carry away all at pnce. He was not, indeed, 
fo much puzzled this time, as h^ had already fecured the 
moft necefTary articles ; however, he chofe nodiing without 
>fully weighing the .vaiue^f.it. 

Amongft other things he refolved to carry away one of 
the fix fmall carriage guns that were in the fhip. 

Rub, A gun ! I think he might have carried away fome- 
thing more ufefal. 

Mr. Bill. Yes, fo we may think who fee things at a 
diflance. Robinfon, on the contrary, who judged of his 
fituation from a nearer view of it, thought this gun a very 
AeceiTary article, were it only for his eafe and fccurity. 

JiicJh. How fo ? 

Mr, Bill. The part of the fhore, where he was oblj^d 
for the prefent to lodge what goods he had bxDught out ofthe 
fhip, WHS open on every fide, and^ unfbrtnnitely, at no great 
difbjice from the fpot where the favages ufed to land. Jrfe

whenever he thought ef it. His deiign was> therefore, in 
having a piece of cannon on the itiore, to fire a ball over 
their heads when they approached the ifland in their canoes, 
and fo terrify them, ana make them perhaps fheer off and 
return to their own country. 

You fee now, my dear Richard, how liable we are to be 
millaken, when we take upon us to give an opinion con*- 
eernin^ the behaviour of other perfons. We very feldora 
kiiow all the motives that induce a man to a6l ; how can we, 
therefor?, be fo prefumptuous as to fet up for judges of his 
adlions ? A wife man thinks that he can never be too circum^ 
fpe^ in the judgment which he pafTes upon the condud of 
other peribns ; he even forbears to give an opinion unlefs h« 
be obliged ; he is fenfible that he has enough to do to look to 
himfelf and his own affairs ; and thus, my dear children, we 
will endeavour to a£i for the ftiture. 

Befides the piece of cannon, they placed alfo upon the raft 
the following articles : ift. three fmall bags, one of rye, 
another of barley, and the lail of peafe ; xd.Va cheft of nails 
'4md fcrews ; 3d. a dozen of hatchets ; 4th. a barrel of gun- 
.powder, with balls and ihot; .5th. a fail ; 6tk« agrindftone. 

HM. Why that} 

Mr. BilL To ihaipen the knives, bacchets, nvd othfir 
tools, when they requiredit. 

Rich. Were there no ftones crpon.the ifland ? 

Mr. BilL Yes, plenty ; bat none fit for iharpening dieir 
. xnftruments* Have not you obferved, that thofe ftbnes which 
are ufed for that purpofe are Of a paiticukir fort, and'nuic|i 
•fofterthonnibft others ? 

Rich. Yes, I have. 

Mr, Bill, Well, Robinfon had never yet found upon his 
'}fkad any of that fort of done, which has lefs hardnefs than 
. fione in general, and feems compofed of grains of fand. Bat 
a grindftone }S not only exceedingly uieful, but indifpenfably 
ncceilary to thofe who make ule of fharp^ iron tools., He 
preferred it, therefore, without hefitation, to the gold-duft 
and diamonds^ which he had valued fo little before^ and hod 
left behind him in his firit trip to the vefiel. 

Before he fet off to return, Robinfon examiaed the con- 
dition of the fhi]>. He found, the leak was gaining gronnid, 
and that the rubbing of her Mts againfl the rock, occafioncd 

Sthe motion of the waves, had already loofened and ftart- 
feveral planks. He foreiaw, therefore, that the firftgnil 
.«f wind would 4^ the ihip to pieces, ^d concUdAd. ^kAX

he muft be expeditioas if he wifiied to fave much more of tke 
cargo. 

As the wind blew then towards ftiore, they were able to 
reach it folely by the affiftance of their ikil and oars> though 
the ebby which had fcarce run half down, was againfl them* 
In their way to the (hore, Robinfon blamed himfelf much for 
one thing. His way of thinking here proves him to have 
teen a perfeft lover of juftice. 

Enliv. For what did he blame himfelf, papa ? 

Mr, Bill, For not carrying away the gold-dull and di- 
amonds. 

Eiltx), What would he have done w.tth them ? 

Mr, Bill. He had no view of ufing thefe things himfelf, 
but he reafoned thus : *' It is not abfolutely impolTible,*' faid 
he, *' that the captain of the velTel may be ttill alive, and 
come fome day or other to examine* whether he cannot fave 
part of the cargo. If a gale of wind were to rife and daih 
the (hip to pieces before yon could go back to it, and tbm 
the diamonds and gold-dufl were to be loil, how could you 
jttftify yourfelf to the owner and to your oa n confcience, fmr 
having thought merely of faving what might be of ofe to 
yourfelf, mdioat paying the leail attention to his intereft by 
laving the goods that would be moft valuable to him ? Per- 
haps his fortune,, and that of many other perfons, depend on 
this flight infbmce of attention which you have negleded to 
pay them. Robinfon ! Robinfon I" cried he, highly diflk- 
tia£ed with himfelf, '' how far art thou ftill from being as 
jail as thou oughteA to be !" 

He was on the point of pufhing back again before he land* 
ed, his confcience was fo touched at his negledling a duty 
which he with reafon looked upon as faored. 

In the mean time they approached the (hore, and, joft as' . 
they were about to land, they ran the rifk of feeing all their 
goods loft in the Tea ; for, as it continued itill to ebb, and 
the depth of the water leffeued every moment, the headmoiit 
part of the raft was foon upon the dry fand, and, confequcnt- 
ly, higher than the Hernmofl:, which was fupported by the 
water, that was falling every inftant. Luckily Robinibn and* 
Friday wf re both a&m, and> therefore, able to fiop the 
goods which werefli|:^ing off, and to keep than fit)m lolliDg: 
into the fea. 

After they had made all things fteady, they^were oblised

•ould get them afhore. By their care and precaa&m in diis 
bufmeis^ nothing was ntho* loft or damag«l> and they were 
ready to put to fea again before the return of the tide. 

Robinion was no fooner aboard the (hip than he haftened to 
oonvey upon the raft the barrel of gdd-duft and the cafket 
of jewels ; and, having thus relieved his con(cience of a load 
which lay upon it, he Sionght he had now a right to think of 
himfelf. 

In this trip he carried away, among other articles, fome 
wheel- barrows which happened to be aboard, I know not for 
what ufe ; a great quantity of cloaths and linen ; a number 
of tools and pieces of furniture ; a lantern, and all the papers 
that were in the captain's cabin. As the tide was now flow- 
ing up, they fet fail, and, having the advanuge of wind and 
tide, they were quickly afhore. 

RobinfoQ fpent the reft of the day in taking a precaution 
which he thought ihdifpenfably neceflary. He trembled at 
the idea, that, were a heavy fhower to come on, he.fhould be 
difabled from ufmg what he counted the moft valuable of all 
his efFedls, namely, his gunpowder. To prevent fuch an ac- 
cident, he refolved that very day to make a tent of a large 
fkikloth which he had faved, and to lodge his treafure under 
it, where it would be fafely ftieltered from the rain. 

As he was now provided with fciflars and with needle and 
thread, this work was foon finiftied, and Friday was not long 
before he knew enough of it to be able to affift him. lie 
could not fufticiently admire the admirable invention of the 
needle and fciifars ; and frequently declared, that, in com- 
parifoii of the induftnons Europeans, he and his countrymen 
were no better than poor idiots. 

They finifhed the tent before fun. fet, and Robinion had 
ftill time to ihew Friday the effcft of a great gun. He char- 
ged it with a ball, and pointed the muzzle towards the fea, 
that the ball might ikim the fur&ce of the water, and Friday 
might fee diftin&ly how far the gun would carry. Robinfon 
]^ut fire to die touch-hole, and WQUgh Friday was already in 
ibme meafure prepared for it by two ihots from the mufltet^ 
y£t the exploilon, being now much louder, terrified him fo 
greatly that he trembled fi'om head to foot. The ball marked 
its coiufe on thefuiface of the water by lightly dipping and re>* 
bounding until it was out of fight. Friday affirmed, that a fin- 
gle Ihot like this would be fufiicient to turn his whole nation of 
countrymen to fuddea flight, if they were f vea approaching

fbrttmately, all thefe papers, as well as the bo(^^ were writ-

fore, he had frefli occafion to be forry for havmg negleded 
the.fladyof foreign langoages when he might have learnt 
them. Bnt this forrow, coming too late, was of no u(e. 

Two circumftances, however, which he obferved> gave 
him fome information concerning the fhip's deftination, and 
the objeft of her voyage. He found, amongft others, fome 
letters for perfons in Barbadoes, an iflandinthe Wed Indies, 
where there is a great traffic for flaves, 
' Henry. Traffic for ilaves, ppa ? 

Mr. Bill. I will explain it to you. In Africa— you re- 
m^nber, I fuppofe, which way that quarter of the world 
Iks ? 

Htnry. Oh, yes ; towards the South. 

Mr. Bill. In Africa, which is the country of the negroes, 
nen, in ignorance and Aupidity> do not feem to differ much 
from the brutes. Their chiefs or kings, who are as favagc 
as themfelves, treat them accordingly. If any Europeans 
arrive- on their coaft, whole crowds of blacks are offered to 
them for fale, as we fell cattle here in a market. Even fa- 
thers bring their children, and exchange them for. trifles. 
Thus the Europeans every year purchafe a great number of 
negroes, and carry them to the Weft Indies, where they are 
forced to work at the hardeft labour, and are treated in every 
refpefl with a great deal of fevcrity. The lot of fuch ^.Jlaue 
(for fo thefe unfortunate people are called by their purcha- 
fers) is tinily wretched, nor can we wonder tliat many have 
even preferred death to \u 

• Rich, It is not well done to ufe human beings in that 
manner. 

Mr, Bill. Certainly it' is very unjuft j" and we have hopes 
that in time this iniqaitous traffic of ilaves will be abolifli- 
ed. 

• Robinfon found alfo^ among the papers, an account from 
which he gathered that the (hip was bound for Bnrbadoes, and 
had a hundred ilaves aboard. Having cojnmunicated this 
drcumiiincc to Friday, he added, <* Who know* if thefe poor

Friday agreed th&t this conjedare was not wholly xmj^robable. 
** Well then, my friend," replied Robinfon, with fome 
warmth, " could yotf now repeat the queftioa that you lately 
aflced me ?"

ticles ; they are fuch as render life coinftiodious and happy. 
WheAce ftiodd we have had them were it not for the ftorm .* 
It is, indeed, an unpleafant thing to owe one*s happinefs 
to the misfortunes of another j yet, the great eft number of 
thofe who were, in the ftiip are now, perhaps, better off" than 
"before (he ftruck. As this fuppofuion is not wholly void of 
J)robabilityJ what think you now of the power which govern^ 
the world ?" 

, •• I think,*' anfwered Friday, '« the wlfdom and goodnefs 
of that po\Ver are inexpreflible, and I was a ienfelefs idiot 
in faying what I did/* At the fame time, he lifted up his 
Irands and eves towards Heaven, and implored pardon for 
ijie'faulc which he had committed through ftupidity. 

Robinfon took a& much care of the papers which he had 
been looking over, as of the diamonds an4 gold-duft, that» 
Vever he returned to Europe, he might, by means of them, 
difcover the peribns to whom he ftiould reftore the trcafure 
that he had favtd out of the fhip. 

For fix days fucceflively they made ;two or three trips a day 
to the wreck, and brought to land every thing that they could 
poffibly convey away. A thoufand little matters which we 
would fcarcely think it worth while to pick wp, becaufe wc 
iiave never felt how difagreeable the lofs of them is, were of 
iniinite value to them, and, therefore, they 4id' not neglcvft 
to take them away. One part of the cargo confifted of cle- 



-214 THE MEW 

phants teeth ; thofe they did not touch, becaufe ihvy could 
make no ufe of them. They alfo left behind feveral hogiheads 
of coffee ; as Robinfon was detennined not to fall again into 
the habit of uiing pernicious fuperfluities though ever fo a- 
^reeable : but they tore up and carried away as many of the 
fhip's planks as they could, becaufe they feemed likely to bo 
ufeful, and, confequently, valuable. They took away eveR 
the remaining five pieces of cannon, together widi all the iron 
that they either found loofe or could loofen from the ihip's 
works* 

After they had made eighteen trips, aU with good fucceis^ 
they obferved, as they were on board the nineteenth time, that 
a ftorm was rifing very faft. They made hafte, therefore, to 
load the raft and pufh off, hoping to gain the fhoreb^ rowing 
before the florm (hould gather ttrength. fiut in vam; they 
were fdarce half way towards the fhore, when a violent eale of 
wind, accompanied with thunder, lightning, and rain, (welled 
and agitated the iea in fuch a manner, that the waves, rolling 
over the raft, carried off all the goods that were u^n it. A» 
to themfelves, they held pretty clofe for fome time to the 
mail, fo that the waves could not wa(h them away, though at 
dmes they went clean over their heads. 

At length, the flightnefs of the raft began, to give way to 
the fury of the waves. The cordage and ofier bindings, 
which held the j^ieces of it together, being loofened> all the 
beams of which it confifted quickly came suunder. 

Harriet, Heavens ! what will become of poor Robinfon t 

The Children. Softly ! have patience ! 

Mr, -ff/7/. Friday fought to fave himfelf by fvwmming, and 
Robinfon feized a piece of wood, with which he was fometimea 
plunged into the deep, and fometimes rode upon the ridge of 
the waves. But, being longer under water than above, he 
had loft his breath, and could neither fee nor hear. Hif 
ilrength now forfook him, and he was almoft infenfible ; he 
utters a weak cry, and fmksdown, oppreifed by a huge wave^ 
which carries away the beam that fupported him. . 

Happily his faithful Friday was not far from him, though 
he might have faved himfelf and gained the Ihorc fooner if he 
had chofen to do fo. When he faw him fink, he, without he- 
fitating a moment, dived down, feized him with his left hand# 
and by means of his right rofe with him again to the furfaoe 
of ^ water. He then exerted himfelf wiUi fo much^fuccefs,

' Sr^/ Ci^iV^fvW. Ah ! his body ! 

, Mn Bill. You allfeem to be alarmed. I ufe the word body, 
becaufe Robinfon ihewed no figns of life. 

Friday, who was diftrafted at his mailer's prefent condi- 
tion, carried him a little farther up on, the beacli, hung over 
him, called him witjh aloud voice, ihopk him, rubbed him," 
and joined his lips to his mouth to communicate breath to him 
if poffible. At length he had the inexpreffible fatisfadUon to 
perceive figns o^ life in him ; he, therefore, continued his ex-» 
ertions, and Robinfon quickly recovered the ufe of his fa* 
culties. 

Opening his eyes, he aikcd, in a weak and trembling 
toice, ** Where am I ? *' ** In my arms, my dear mailer I" 
anfwered Friday, with tears in his eyes. An afFedling fcene 
now took place bet wen them. Robinfon thanked Friday a 
thoufand times, and called him his faviour : Friday, for hi^ 
part, thro' joy at feeing him.reilored to himfelf, was almoft 
ready to run wild. ^

][/[^* BILL. Widl, my dear children, our friend Robinfim 
is redored to life onds more. A good night's deep in

vered him lb well, that he was up at day break ; he feU him* 
fell* poiTefTed of his ufual ilrength, and returned thanl^s to 
God for having preferved both his life and health. The 
ftorm had contUHied the whole night, and he waited, n ich

aiW T H, E T H E 

impatience, «A<il it was broad day-light, to fee what wae be<* 
come of the (hip. 

The fun was now above the horizon, and Robiiifim faw, to 
his grief, that the (hip had difappeared. Planks and timbers, 
fcattered here and there upon the beach, were fiifficient to^ 
kens that the ftorm^had d^ed it to jneces. This behig the 
cafe, he found ibmereafon to applaud his own foreiight in 
laving every part of the cargo that hecoold, Happy the man 
whofe prudence and caution always regulate his condud, and 
who, in al^e accidents which deprive him of any advantage, 
can fay to himfelf, with truth, as Robinfon could upon this 
occaiion, that it was not hi^ fault ! How much this inward 
fatisfadlion will lighten the misfortunes, which, without it, 
would be accompanied with the grcateft vexation ! 

Robittfon and Friday were particularly careful to gather all 
the remains of the wreck together on one fpot of the beach. 
They forefaw that every plank and every fplincer might be 
ofufe another time. When they had finiftied everything 
that concerned the wreck, they formed a regular plan of the 
employments which weie to take place next. 

The objcd was, at prefent, to convey all thefe goods to 
their dwelling-place ; but they thought it dangerous, while 
they airried one parcel, to be at fo great a dif^ce from the 
reft. Robinfon fettled it, therefore, that they (hould carry 
the goods and Hand guard alternately, the one in the morning, 
the other in the afternoon. He loaded the carriage guns, 
ranged them beiide each other, like a battery, and pointed 
them towards the fea. They kindled a fire, which he who 
fiood fentinel was to take care to keep up ; and they placed 
a match befide the guns, that they might be ready to fire 
whenever the cafe required it. 

Robinfon made the fi'H journey to carry the goods 
home. In order to fparehis befl cloaths, he had dreft 
himfelf like a failor; and, inftead of the weapons that he 
formerly wore, he had now a cutlafs by his fide, and two 
ioaded piftols in his girdle. He began by loading bis 
wheel-barrow with fome cafks of gunpowder and ocher ar- 
ticles which were mod in danger from the rain* The wa- 
ter-fpaniel, which had never quitted him, was, by no 
means, a ufelefs companion on this journey. Robinfon 
harnefled him to the wheel-barrow, and the dog was of 
confiderable fervice to him in conveying the burthen for- 
ir«rd. As thefe IpanieU are very docile, and capable of 

being 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 217 

being taught many tbingSi this dog was foon trained to 
his new employnienr, and acquitted himfelf In it as well 
as any bead accuftomed to the draught. He carried alfo a 
parcel in his mouth, which he had been taug|;it to do by 
thofe to whom he formerly belonged. 

At "his return, Robinfon brought all his lamas, ready 
harnefled for carrying burthens, in order to ufe them for 
that purpofe. As there were feven of ihcm, and each of 
them was able to carry one hundred and fifty pounds 
weight, you may eafily calculate the weight of goods which 
they> all together, conveyed home every journey. 

So many articles could not all be flowed in Robin font's 
Cellar. He haflened, therefore, to pitch another large tent 
in the enclofed ground before. his cave. This was meant 
as a flore.tenc for the prefent,^ until other means (houjd be 
contrived forfecuring the thing.*. In eight days the whole 
was carried home, except a number of boards andtimbe-.s 
which they (heltered as well a& they could with thickets and 
brufhwood. 

Harriet, Bur, papa, you have not told us any thing raoie 
about the goat. 

' Mr, Bill. Ah! very true; I had nearly forgot Tier. 
Well, the goar, as you may fuppofe, was brought hornb 
alfo, and p?t into a lictle park along with the tame Iamas» 
and ihe a]gfeed very well with them. 
' What agreeable employments have Robinfon and Friday 
now before theip ! They fcarce know where to begin. 
However, Robinfon, who had contrafted a tafte for regu- 
larity, as well as the habit of it, quickly diftinguifhed the 
more necelTary labours from, thofe which were tefs fo, and 
did not heiitate in giving the preference to the former* 
The mod important of all was the building of a fhed, or 
ilorehoufe, to (helter the goods, which could not be put 
into the cellar, more fecwrely than they were under the' 
tent. Here it was neceffary to do the bufinefs of a houfe- 
Carpenter, to which they had neither of them ferved ai& 
apprenticelhip. 

But what could be difficult to the induftrious and perfes- 
▼ering Robinfon now that he was provided with all forts of 
tools T The moft troublefome pieces of work, and thofe 
in which he had the leaft experience, were no more thaa 
a play to him who had happily fucceeded in fo many otheva 
]^f 4 wkhouc 



2]S T-H SKEW 

without jaffiflaDce or proper tools. The ctftting donrm and 
hewing out of the trees, the fquaring of the beams aod 
rafters, the joining and fitting of them, building of briclc 
walls^ making of a double roof, one of boards » and the 
oiher of the leaves of the cocoa-nut tree— were all executed 
with furprlflng difpatch. 

The little building, when fini(hed, was not much unlike 
€De of our country cottages. Robinfon had taken care 
to bring away with him the (hip's cabin windows ; they 
ferved to give light to th& building, without the incoove* 
niency of holes that would let in the wind. The glaft 
was an objedt of particular admiration to Friday ; he ba4 
never feen any before, and he learnt, by experience, the 
commodious purpofes that it ferves. 

When all was pur under cover and in proper order, Ro- 
binfon thought of contriving for himfelf a convenient way 
of entering his fprtrefs without weakening it. The moft 
fecure method for the purpofe was by means of a commoti 
gate and a drawbridge. Being provided with every ne* 
ccfl^ry for this undertaking, as nails, chains, hinges^ lockS|| 
and iron work of all forts, he irnmediately began uponjt. 
They firft made the gate and the drawbridge ; and^ after* 
wards, the^ made an opening in the terrace, and palifade 
fufHcient for the width of the gate, which they next rear* 
cd up in its place; then they laid down the bridge ia 
* fuch a manner, that, when raifed, it might lie againft the 
gate, and cover it. Lafily, they loaded the guns, ^and 
placed them upon the terrace, in fuch poGtions, that two 
of them (hould defend the right Rank, two the left, and 
two the front of their fortification ; fo that henceforward 
they might be quite at their cafe as to the attacks of the 
favages, and had, befides, the advantage of-aneafy and con^' 
Tenient way for going in and out* 

When harvefl tin^ was come, Robinfon made ufe of

There was one article that would have been exceed! ngt]^ 
lifeful to them, but, unfortunately, they could find nothing 
of the fort amongft the goods in the ihip ; and that waa 
an iron fpade. It is trur, Friday had made one of hard 
wood that might ferve upon occalion, but ill 11 they found 
room to wiih for a better ; for it is certain » that an iroa 
fpade 18, after alU more handy and efifedive for breaking 
up the ground, than a wooden one can poffibly be* Ro- 
bmfon, therefore, who determined, for the future, to make 
agriculture his principal employment, as being, of all 
forts of labour, the moil agreeable and moil ufeful, con* 
ceived the defign of fixine up a forge to make fpades him* 
felf, and poffibly other inftruroents befides. 

This deiign was. not fo extravagant as perhaps you maf 
think it ; for every thing neceflary for a forge was to be 
found in his florehoufe. There was a fmall anvil, feveral 
pair of pincers, a pretty large jpair of bellows, and Aich a 
ftock of iron, both wrought and in bars, as would probably 
be fufficicnt to keep him in work all his life- time. Thia 
plan was, therefore, immediately put in execution. 

By means of a large boarded roof, which they put over 
the kitchen, it was to extended that they were able to &x 
tip a forge in it, and to work at it even during the rainy 
feafon. Part of this feafon, therefore, they fpent in work* 
ing fmiths work ; and if they fucceeded upon the whole» 
it was not without fome difappointments and unfuccefsful 
trials. When the fpades were finifiied, Robinfon had a 
mind to go a little farther, and to tr]^ his abilities at ma- 
king a plough } and in this alfo, to hia inexpreffible joy, he 
perfcAly fucceeded. 

This plough was, you may fuppofe, very diflferent from 
ours. It confiiled of a (ingle branch of a tree ; one end 
ef which, bending down, reiled on the ground, and waa 
furniihed with a fock, and alio a handle, by means of 
which the perfon who ploughed might guide it at pleafure: 
at the other end they were to hamefs their oxen, or horfes; 
hut as they had none, they were obliged themielves to fup« 
ply their places* In a word, this plough waa ezadly like 
that in ufe a^nongft the antieat Greeks, at their firft un« 
dertaking thi^praSice of agricuUure. I can give you a 
iLctch of it here*

Mr. Bill. Nor you 'fee it had nor. AW inflrunKnta-

degrees men made additions for greater convenience : fo 
by altering and improving they eiK:reafed the utility and 
commodiouiiiers of the tools necel&ry for their different 
labours*. 

In the meaa time, Robin foft had every reafoir to be: 
proud of this imrention ; it was whoUy his own, for he 
had never feen apian of ir*. By all that we can learn froiUi 
hiftory, many ages of the world elapfed^ before men arrived 
at the invention even of fo funple a* machine as this plough ;^ 
aod the inventors of it were looked upon by polberity as. 
men of fuch exalted wifdoro, that, after their death, they 
were paid divine honours. * Richard^ you remember the? 
name of him to whom, the Egyptians attribute the in vc it— 
tton of the plough. 

Rich. Yes 5 it was Ofiris, whom, for thM. reafen,, they 
afterwards worfbipped as a god. 

Mr. Bill. The Phoenicians afcribed thi&ufeful invemiom 
to one Dagon, whom they alfo regarded as a being, of fu— 
perior order, and called the Son of Heaveo..

Mr, Bilh At firft he doubted whether they were fit for 
this work, as they feemed rather bcafts of bi|rthen than oiF 
draught ;- however, he determined con>ake atrial of them^ 
and the fuccefs of it exceeded his hopes. They became: 
gradually SKCuftoraed to. the work, which„at lengthy they 
per&rmed in evesy refpe^^as perfectly as.if Robinfon and 
Friday had been brought up ploughmen, and the lamas had) 
h«en trained like, our beads of draught.

wanted but one inftrumenr, which they could fcarcely do 
iiiittiottr, and which they had not found in the (hip. 

Ikmy, I can guefs what that was. 

Mr. Bill. What do you think I 

Henry, A harrow* * 

Mr, Bill. You ar« right. Without it tlttige W0l|ld be 
}n)})erf^6t. By meaps of h we ineak thie cl.ods, ihtow the 
grains of corn into the furrows,, and cover them, withoat 
which they ^ould never fprlng up, but be devoured by the 
birds. 

^ la (he firft place, Robinfon made as many iron teeth as 
lie thought would be necellary for 'the harrow. After Tome 
luafuccelsful attempts, he, at lengthy Aicceeded in making 
the wooden frame in wbigh thefe iron teeth were to bf 
fijted. Laflly, he made as many hpl^t in the frame at it 
was to contain teeth, and v^hen he had driven them io^ sm4 
clioched them, the ha^rrQw was finiihed. 
" The rainy fcafon being oYer» he fowcd two buflicU of 
rye, one of barley, and half a bufhel of peafe^ and, at the 
end oP five months, he had the farisfa^ion to gather sl 
' crop of twelve times as much feed as he had fown,. namely,, 
twenty-four bufliels of rye, twelve of barley, and fix of 
peafe; a dock more than fufiicient to lad them fix months.: 
JBut, like a prudent qecononiiii^, he was willing to have a. 
Superabundance of every thing, becaufe th^re might come 
on a feafon of Tcarcity ; befides, hail or other accident* 
jmight defiroy his crop?. He rcfolved,. therefore, to have 
a barn, which being filled every half ) ear, might alwaya. 
contain a fulHcient dock, in cafe a crop (hould happen to- 
fail. .... 

With this intention, when the weather was fettled faifji. 
they unroofed the dorehoufe, in «rder to add another 
i!cry to it, which might fervc as a granary.. The buildings 
of this required more (kill and labour than that of the 
ground floor; but their indefatigable perfeverance tri^ 
limphed over all difiicukies,. and the work was fooA hap« 
pily completed. 

Paring thefe tranfad^ionf ,, the goat yeaned two young 
ones I fo that the fpecies might now be multiplied and

interrupt you» fo that yoa will certainly be able to get 
^oughit. 

Mr. Bill* Well, I Ihall try ; but prepare yourfelves for 
a frefti fcene of horror, the event of which cannot be fore- 
men— By your motions I can nearly perceive what your 
cortjeftures are ; the fequel will fljew whether they are juft. 

If I were to go on now enumerating to you all that Ro- 
l>infon performed every day by the help of the tools with 
y^hich he was provided, the recital would not amufe yott 
very much. 

KicHf. It might be agreeable enough ; but we can eaiily 
imagine all that. 

Mr» Bill. 1 ihall only inform you, that they fucceffively 
attempted many different arts, and imitated moft forts oi 
tradeunen — the baker, the. bladdmith, the taylor, the fhoe- 
maker, the carpenter, the joiner, the wheelright, the pot- 
ter, the gardener, the butcher, the fifherman, and feveral 
others ; they imitated them, I fay, with fo much fuccefs, 
that they were foon able to make up a hundred things, for 
which we indolent Europeans require a& many different 
workmen. Their ftrengtii ihcreafec^ in proportion as they 
exerted it, and their minds, being in a fbte of conflant 
activity, and always in fearch of fome ufeful objefl, were 
improved every day more and more. May not this be re- 
garded as a proof that we were created for the fame adi- 
vity, iince health, virtue, and happinefs, are the neceflary 
confoquences of it ? 

Six months pafTed away in thefe agreeable employments,, 
during all which time Friday dudl not revive the fcheme 
of taking a voyage to his own country ; but frequently^ 
aifter finHhing his talk of work, he would go up the hUI 
from whence he could foe his native ifland, and there, l)u- 
ried in profound thoughtfulnefs, he lamented the misfor- 
tune of being foparated from his father,, perhaps for ever. 
Robinfon> for h» part, had avoided fpeakihg on the fub^ 
jedt, becaufe it was not in his power to comply with hts> 
friend's wiih while the neceifary arrangements^ 'which their 
new vf^y of living required, were itill unfiniihed. 

At prefent the moft indifoeniable ^parts of the bufinefs 
were compfeted, and Robinfon was the firft to propofe the 
building of another boat, to go and feek Friday's father^

fon appeared in the fame manner. The work was begun 
the very next day, and, with the help of good hatchets, 
was finifhed, as you may eafily imagine, much better and 
much fooner than the fir ft time. 

One morning that Robinfon was engaged in the ordi- 
nary cares of ms habitation, he fent Friday to the fea-lide 
for fome turtle, which was now become a rarity to them. 
After a fhort abfence, he came back running at full-fpe^ii ' 
Out of breath with running and with fright together, Kc 
could but juft ftammer out thefc words, *' Here they are ! 
here they are!** 

Robinfon, in a fright, afked him haftily whom he meant. 
'•Oh! mafter! matter!" anfwered Friday, "•one, two, 
three— fix canoes I" In his flurry he could fcarcely bring 
out the number ^x. 

Robinfon ran haftily up to the top of the hillock, and 
faw, not without fhuddermg, that Friday had counted right. 
He pNerceived fix canoes full of favages, jull ready to land. 
Coming down immediately, he bid Friday be of good cou- 
rage, who ttood trembKn? all the while ; and he a&ed 
him, >^ether, if they ftomd come to an engagement with 
the eneoQ^, he would ftand by him fkithfuUy^ to the bed of 
vjiia "power. 

*• Yes," anfwcrcd he, •« to the laft drop of my blood;** 
ibf, having had time to recover himfelf, he felt his cou<i 
rage mount by degrees to its ufual pitch. ** Well," faid 
Robinfon, «Met us endeavour to prevent thefe monilerc 
^om executing their horrible defigns., I will explain my 
intention to you as we go along ; this is not the time to 
talk^we muft aft." 

With thefe words he wheeled down one of the carriage 

funs, took fix mufkets, two brace of pifiols, and two 
angers. Kach of them put a brace of piftols in his girdle^ 
a hanger by his fide, and three mufkets on his fhoulderj^ 
and wken they had taken a fufficiient quantity of powder and 
ball, they harneffed themfelves to the gun, and with a firm 
countenance took the field under all that formidable and 
warlike apparatus. 

Havine palTed the drawbridge, they halted. Friday 
went back into die fort to raife the bridge and fhut the gate, 
and then, by means of the ladder of ropes, which always 
hung to the rock, he came out. again, and joined his gene^ 
Xfll* Rofainfoa thou^t this precaution neceflary, that, in 



cafe their undertaking (hoold not fucceed> the enemy might 
not be able to get polTeflion of his fortrefs. 

Here Robinfon explained to Friday the plan that he haS 
formed. ** We will go round the hillock," faidhe, ** and 
walk through the thickeft part of the wood, that we may 
not be perceived by the enemy ; and, then, croffing amongn 
the thickets, which extend almoft to the fea-fide, we (hall 
a|^roach the favages without being perceived by them, 
wlen within reach of them, we will fire the great gun, 
and the ball pailing over their heads, no doubt, will terrify 
the barbarians, m^e them abandon their prey, and teke to 
flight in their canoes." 

Friday thought the plan not impra^icable. " Thus,'* 
continued Robinfon, ^« we fhall have the fatisfadiion of 
laving the unfortunate wretches whom they intend to de- 
vour, without fhedding a drop of blood. But if, contrary 
to our expeditions, they ihould be encouraged by their 
numbers, and not take to flight, then, "my dear Friday, we 
muft fhew that we are men, by bravely facing the daneer 
to which we ihall expofe ourielves from the moft laudable 
intentions. He, from wl^om nodung is hid, fees what in* 
duces us to endanger our lives ; he will prefervc thpm if it" 
6e for our advantage ; therefore, his will be done/* 

And {6 faying, he gave his haQd to his companion, and 
they mutually promifed to afiifl each other to the la& drop 
of their blood. 

Having arrived without noife almoft at the laft of the 
thickets, they thiere made a halt. Robinfcm, in a low 
voice, delired Friday to fteal with all poflible circumfpec- 
tion behind a large tree which he fliewed him, and then 
to come back and inform him whether he could difcover 
the enemy from that fpot. He brought back word that 
they were eafily to be feen fitting round a large fire, and 
picking the bones of one prifoner whom they nad already 
difpatched ; that, not far from them, he faw another lying 
on the ground, and tied hand and foot, who feemed to b« 
a white., man, and had the appearance of a beard ; and 
that, in all probability, he was going foon to fhare the 
fame fate. 

Robinfon was flartled at this report, efpecially when he 
heard mention of a white man. Having a prolpedi glafs 
about him which he had found aboard the fliip, he went 
to the tree himfelf, and from thence^ by the help of thi^ 

inftra- 



ROBtNSONCkOSOI. ^LlJ 

fttftrument, could difcover that Friday's account was per- 
e&ly true. He faw about fifty favages fitting round a fireg 
and could clearly diitinguilh the prifoner to be an Euro- 
pean. 

He could fcarcely contain himfelf ; his heart throbbed, his 
Hood boiled. If he were, to yield to the fury of his firft 
paifion, and fall upon thefe barbarians at pnce» it would be 
the way to fhed much blood. But, as the blind inftinft of 
paflion (hould never get the better of reafon> he reftrains his 
tranfports in order to avoid that unpleafing neceffity. 

As there was a fpot farther on equally fheltered ^tk 
thickets, he went behind a bufh preity near the favagcff, 
arid which had ao opening in the middle of it large enough 
to fee through, though not to be remarked at a diftance ; 
there he points his cannon in fuch a manner that the ball 
would pals over the heads of the favages high enough not to 
hurt them. Then he told Friday, in a low voice, to imitate 
^-cxadtly what he ihould fee him do. 

' He lays down two of his mu&ets on the gromid, and 
holds the third in his hand ; Friday does the fame : he then 
applies a lighted match to the touch-hole of the cannon, and 
fires it off. 

At the noife of the report, the favages fell backwards on 
the grafs as if they had b«en all fhot at once. Robinfbn and 
Friday, on their fide, attentive to what paiTed, and uncertain 
•what might be the event, prepared for engaging if that 
ihould happen to be neceflary. In lefs than a minute the 
favages nfe off the ground, recovering from their aftoniih- 
ment ; the moil fearful run to their canoes, but the boldeft 
-take np their arms. 

They had been frightened merely by the noife of the can- 
-non J unfortunately, they did not perceive the fire, nor 
hear the whiftling of the ball. The fright was, therefore, 
not near fo ^reat as had been expedied. After looking round 
•on every fide without difcovering any thing that could terrify 
them again, they gathered courage, and thofe who were 
running away prefently returned. They all fet up a dread, 
ful yell, and began their war dance, fhaking their weapons 
with furious loc^s and geftures* 

Robinfbn was undetermined what to dq;-but obferving 
with furprife, that, when the dance was ended, the whole 
•company of die favages not only took their places again, but 
fent two of their number to feize the unfortunate European,

he could not contain himfelf any longer. He looks at Fri- 
day> and fays to him> in a low voice> ** You uke the lighr, 
I the left> and Heaven be our defence I'' So raying> he 
prefents and fires ; Friday does the fame. 

The man took much better aim than the mafter ; font on 
the enemy's left there fell ^v^^ and on the right only three : 
of thefe eight three were killed, the reft wounded: The 
conllernatiKHi with which thofe who were, not hurt took to 
flighty cannot be defcribed. Some ran one way» fome ano- 
ther» all of them yelling in the moH hideous manne -. Ilo* 
binibn was going to fally oat £rom behind the bufhes^ fword

liver the unfortunate European^ who lay bound hand and 
foot ; but he faw> with aftonifhment^ a party of the runaways^ 
rally all of a fudden, and. Hand upon their^ defence. He 
made hafte to take up a fecond muiket> ai^ Friday doing the 
fame, they both fired at once. 

At this difcharge there fell only two of the enemy ; bat 
feveral of them, being wounded, fome more, fome lefs dai%e« 
r^ttfly, began to run awav, howlin|; dreadfully : prefenUy, 
three of them fell down, but ftill with fome remains of li^* 

Robinfon> when he laid down the gun that he bad joft 
fired, to take up the third, which was flill loaded> faid to 
Friday in a loud voice, *' Now let us fhew ourfelves :" at 
the fame inftant, they both fiart from their concealment, and 
appear before the lavages. Robiniba flies to the unfortunate 
pnfoner, to (hew him that relief was at hand ; but as- \m 
approaches him, perceives that fome of the favages,'who be- 
fore were running away, now that they difcovered their 
enemy, flopped fhort, and rallied to prepare for combaK. 
He noticed this to Friday, who perfedlly under flood his 
xnafler's meaning, advanced a little way, fired, and faw on» 
of the Indians fall. 

In the mean time, Robinfon, with his knife, cut the 
bulnifhes with which the prifoner's hands and feet were tied, 
and afking him in Englifh and Latin who he was, the man 
anfwered in Latin, Cbriftianus, Hijpanus ; that is, a Chrif« 
tian and a Spaniard. His exceflive weaknefs hindered him 
from faying any more, fortunately, Robinfon had taken 
care to provide a bottle of wine, in cafe of being wounded. 
He gave the Spaniard a little, which revived him exceed- 
ingly, fo that he ifoon began to recover his firength. Rq- 
binfon then furnifhed him with a hanger and a piflol, that he 

might

might help them to complete tlK defeat of thd faTai;ea» and, 
meaa time» Friday was ordered to brmg all the mnfkpts, 
that they might be loaded afreih. 

The moment the Spaniard was armed with a hanger and 
a piftoU he fell fmionilv upon his enemies, and diipatched 
t^e of them -in the twinkling of an eye. Friday^ with the 
fixth mnfket, which had not been fired yet, sulvanced to 
fapport him» while Robinfon was haftening to load the other 
five. The two champions found fome refinance at firft, and 
flbre foon feparated ; for the Spaniard came to clofe engage^ 
ment with a very ftout Indian, and Friday, on the other 
hand, after firing his laft mufket, purfued, (word in hand, 
a whole party of runaways^ fome of whom fell beneath his 
arm, others jumped into the fea to fwim to their canoes, and 
the reft fled and iiid themfelves amongft the bufhes. 

\But the Spaniard was now hard put to it. He had, it is 
true, at firft, notwithftanding his weaknefs, attacked the 
Indian with great impetudfity, and given him two wounds 
11 the head with his hanger ; but this fo enraged the favage, 
that with his heavy flone falchion he was near cutting the 
Spaniard down, who found it as much as he could do to 
parry off his blows : nor, indeed, could he at length prevent 
the furious Indian from feizing him by the middle, throwing 
him to the ground, and twilling the hanger out of his hand; 
but in the very moment that he was going to cut off his head> 
Robinfon, perceiving the Spaniard's danger, fired at the 
favage, and killed him on the fpot. 

Scarce was the Spaniard raifed firom the ground before he 
feized a loaded mufket, and went with Friday in purfuit of 
the favages who had fled into the coppice. As they were 
few in number, and for the moft part wounded, Robinfon 
thought it befl to remain on the field of battle, and obferve 
the motions of thofe who had efcaped to their canoes. His ' 
two friends were not long before they joined him again, with 
the affurance that there were no more of the enemy in the 
wood. 

They were both about to enter one of the canoes which 
the favages had left, and to purfue thofe who were rowing 
off to fea ; but Robinfon flopped them. •* My friends," 
faid he, " it is enough ; we have, perhaps, fhed more blood 
than we ought. Let us fuffer thofe to live who have no 
longer the intemion «r the power to hart us.''

in a friendly manner, and pointing to the Spaniard, '< is 
mot our army alfo fhx>nger now by one-third than it was in- 
the morning ? Thus reinforced, we fliall be able at any time 
to cope wi£an army of thefe miferable enemies, eipecially 
if we flay for them behind our entrenchments." 

Harriet. That was well done of Robinfon, to {pare the 
remainder of the favages. . 

Mr. Bill. It was certainly a£dng with prudence and hu- 
manity. It would have been too cruel to kill, without necef- 
iity, a Angle one of thefe unfortunate wretches, who had, 
not the lead fufpicion that there was any harm in what they 
were doing, and who, on the contrary » embraced, as the 
cleareft truth, that deplorable error, winch taught then^ that 
to kill and eat a great number of tbsir enemies was a very 
meritorious action, • 

Ednv. Yet, I think, they ought to have known that it wa& 
not right to do fo. 

Mr. Bill. My dear friend, how could they have known it? 
Edw. Hey-day 1 Why any little child knows that it i$ 
not right to kill a man and then eat him. 

. Mr. Bill. But how does the little child know this? Is it 
not by being early fo inibruded i 
Ediv. Yes, certainly. 

Mr. Bill. And if he had never been inftrufted on the fob- 
je£i ; if his father, his mother, and all thofe whom he ought 
to love and refpe^, had always told him that it is a \trf 
laudable a6^ion to kill one's enemy, and eat his body ? 
Ednjo. Nay, why— to be fure — then . 

Mr. Bill. Why, then, a child would never fufped the 
contrary. He would rather partake, as foon as he was. of 
age, in the killing and the feaiting. This was the cafe with 
tiiofe poor favages. Let us thank God that we were not 
bom amongfl diem, but had civilized parents^ who early 
inftnidled us in the difference between good and evil, jofiice 
and injuilice. 

Our hero, the friend of human land, fhed tears of com- 
paflion when he traverfed the field of battle to aiTift thofe 
who were ftill alive. It was all over with the greateft part 
ef them, and the refl expired in his arms while he pouie4 
wine upon their wounds, and endeavoured to recover them.

Mr, BtlL Have a little patience, and you ihall hearw 
Some incidents happened in the mean time which I moft 
^ll relate to you. 

Rich. Indeed ! well, that roufes my curiofity* 

Mr. BllU Robinfon, having a mind to examine one of 
the two canoes which the favages had left behind them, went 
towards it, and, to his great aCloniftunent, he found in it ano» 
ther unfortunate creature, tied hand and foot as the Spaniard 
Jhad been, and looking more dead than alive« \ 

Robinfon made hafte to cut his cords, and would have 
lifted him up, but he was not able either to ftand or fpeak^ 
He lay groaning, no doubt, under th,e apprehenfion i^ 
they were going to put him to death. 

As he was an Indian, not ah European, Robinfon called 
Friday, who was then bufy in burying the dead bodiesj * to 
Ypeak to him in his native tongue. Scarce had he caft eye^ 
on the ptifoner before Robinfon and the Spaniard faw a fcen* 
take place which drew from them tears of benevolent fym- 
pathy« Friday, lU of a fudden, like a man befide hijnfel€>

cries, Ito^hs, jumps, daiiccsy iroars^ cla(^ hishands^ fbikes 
himfelf on the face and bfeaft> criies ont kgain, and, tn &ort» 
a£ls like one that is delirious. It was ibme. time before Ro« 
Innibn, who queftioned and urged him repeatedly, coold draw 
from him this fhort anfwer, " Jt is my father !" 

$t would be difficult to defcribe all the marks of filial love 
and alle6fion which this excellent young* man fhewed upon 
this occafion. Twenty times he jumj^ out of the canoe 
upon !land« and from the land into the canoe again. 
Some timesy fitting down, he opened his jacket, and prefled 
his ^Ether's head to his bofom to warm it ; at others, he 
nibbed the joints of his arms and legs, which were numbed 
by having been (o tightly bound ; and now he embraced him 
ag;un, and covered him with kifTes. Robinfon, who had 
fHU fome wine in his bottle, gave it to him to wa(h his fa- - 
ther*s limbs, which were grievoufly fwelled. He then flepped 
afide to let Friday indulge his joy with more freedom. 

Returning after fome time, he aiked him if he had made 
his father take any nourifliment. '* The glutton," anfwered 
he, pointing to hinrfelf, *' had before eaten up all," Ro- 
binfon gave him his breakfaft, which he had not touched,* 
and Friday gave it to his father. Scarce had he received it 
when his (on ilarted out of the canoe in a hurry, and went 
off fo quick, that before Robinfon had time to fay Where 
are you ^oing, Friday was already out of fight. 

He foon appeared again, but did not come back with 
•uite fuch expedition. When he was pretty near, they coxAd 
fee that he had a pitcher of water in oiie hand, and fome vic- 
tuals in the other. He gave the water to his father, and the 
viAuals to his mafler in return for the bre:dc^ which he had 
ftceived fiom him. The cold water afforded vifible re- 
firefhment to the old man, who was ready to faint with thirft. 

Bkobinfon then turned towards the Spaniard, who, esdaufted 
mth fatigue, was lying flretched upon the grafs. He made 
Fdday help hioi aUb to fome refrefmneht. The Spaniard, by 
his looks, endeavoured to exprefs his gratitttde. He (trore 
to rife, but was not able, being prevented by the pain that he 
fth in the joints of his hands and feet, which were fwelled 
from having been bound fo very tightly. Friday was or- 
dered to lit down befide him, to l»the Ms arms and le« 
with win^, and to take the &inecare of Mm as be had of his 
ftther.

It WIS truly moniig to behold thii affectionate £>ii» who* 
while he ttttemled the Spaniard,, tarned his head every mo-, 
aent towardi his fi^er to fee how he was. At one tiiiie» 
when the old man, in order to repofe himrelf> lay down at 
full length, Friday, quite nneafy, flew to him without fpeah* 
ing a word ; but when he (aw that hb &ther had oxUy lata 
down to be more at his eafe, he returned in a moment, ani 
oontinaed his attentba to the Spaniards Robinibn now had 
a mind to try whether he could not, with Friday's affiftance^ 
convey ^e Spaniard to the canoe ; but Friday, who was 
young and fbong> took that talk upon himfelf alone, and car* 
ried mm with esue upon his (houlders. When they had placed 
in the other canoe, not only the.cannon and the mufkets, but 
ftlfo all the arms of the cOiiquered Indians, Friday quickly en- 
tered the iirft, and, though the wind began to freihen, and 
was rather againft him, yet' he made fuch fpeed, by dint of 
rowing, that Robinibn, who ran on foot along the fea-fide^ 
could by no means equal the fwiftnefs of the canoe* He was 
fcarce half way home when he (aw Friday returning, who 
^ifed by him in his way to fetch the other canoe ; and before 
Kobinfon could get up to the firft, where the Spaniard and 
Friday's father were, Friday was diCTe with the fceond : 
with fuch remarkable fwiftnefs did he ^ow. 

They were now oppofite their dwelling-place. Robinfbn 
haflenod thither for fome planks and poles,' which he put 
together in the form of a litter or bier, to convey the difabled 
men to his habitation with more eafe. He and Friday carried 
them up, one after the other. What a treafure was here 
for Robinibn, who longed for nothing fo much as the happi- 
nefsof enlarging hk compamr ! His heart beat with joy when 
he. reflected, t)ut,.fi)r the f^uture, he need not apprehend 
being forced to lead a life of folitude again. His fausfadios 
was complete. As the- two invalids feemed to have occafioa 
for nothing fo much as reft, Robinfon prefently warmed fome 
wine to bathe their hruifed limbs, wmle Friday made them 
tip a. bed, on whicU wjj^en ready, the^ delayed not to re- 
pofe themfelves. 

Thetwo hods then prepared a ^oodfupper, Friday was 
ordered to go to the park, and bring home a yotng lama.; 
^LofainfaD tmdertook ^1 the reft* He could not help fmiling 
afeeqaently at the thought that he Should now refemble a king

acknowledged his will as iheit fupreme law^ and were bound 
to expofe tnexnfelves in his caufe eo the greateft dangers if 
Reteuary. One circumilance was remarkable, that he 
CO mted in his dominions as many different {t6is of religion 
as he had fubjefls. Friday had adopted his mafter's religion^ 
^ ch was the Protcftant ; the Spaniard was a Romaa 
Caiiolicy and Friday's father was an idolater. 
* '^ What is to be done in this matter ?" faid Robinfen to. 
Kimfslf : *« have I not a right to oblige them all to embrace 
the belief which 1 think beft?'* He was fome time refledine 
on this fubjed^ becaufe it was one that had never engaged 
his thoughts before. 

What anfwer think ye, my dear children, ihouid found 
reafon have given to this quellion i Ought he to force his 
fubje^ls to receive his particular religion, or ought he not ? 

ne CbiUren, He fhould not conilrain them in any re« 
fpca. 

Mr. Bill. Why not ? 

Rich. Becaufe a mane's belief, or way of thinking, is in- 
dependent of all the world, provided he behaves himfelf 
inofFen li vely in oth^ refpe^ls . 

Mr. Bill. But if a mafter fees clearly that his fubjefl is in 
an error, may he not lawfully force him to renounce it ? 

Rich. What would be the confequence ? When a man is 
forctd to believe, he becomes neither the hqnefler nor the 
wifer for it. 

Mr. Bill. That is true, for violence can never convince 
him that he was in an error before ; and of what ufe can 
profeiTmg be, when it does not proceed from conviction. 
Beiides, how is a man certain that. he whom he would force 
to embrace his belief, is really in an error ? May he not 
be miflaken himfelf? 

Henry. Certainly, that might be the cafer 

Mr. Bill. How foi 

Henry. Becaafe every man is liable to be deceived. 

Mr. Bill. Confeqqently, no man ban a right to advance 
kis opinions as inconteilable truths. 

In fine, m^ dear chikiren, it belongs to God alone to be 
Ae infallible judge of our belief: he alone can decide on the 
troth or falfehood of our opinions ; none bat he can know 
perfectly whether our fearcn after the truth has been eamcft 
and fincere, or flight and negligent ; nor in there ainr but he 
who can judge h^ far oar errors are to be imputed to as. 

RobinAa 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1^35 

Robinfonfaw this matter nearly in the fame li|ht. ** Far 
from me,'* faid he, " be the indifcreet zeal which endea^ 
vours to force men into its belief 1 Far from me be the blind 
frenzy of perfecuting and torturing fellow-creatures, merely 
becaufe they have the misfortune to be deceived, or »the 
virtue to refufe profeffing publicly that of which they arc 
not convinced inwardly. In my ifland, at leaft, fuch in- 
juftice (hall never find a place. I will do every thing in my 
power to enlighten my new fubjedls ; but if 1 am not happy 
enough to convince them of their errors, or of the truth of 
my religion, thcnJ (hall leave them to believe what they 
can believe, and to give an account of their faith, not to 
me, who am their equal, and liable to errOr, but to God 
alone, the unerring judge of all." . . . • 

.He, therefore, rciblved, that all, without diftiiftlon.^ 
fhould enjoy the free exercife of their religion, if it iho\44 
Co happen, that,^ notwithllanding previous inibudlion, they 
could not agree amongil themfelves upon one (ingle form of 
religious worlhip. T 

Friday being now returned, they forthwith prt)?eeded t^ 
get ready the fupper. *' let us celebrate this day," faid^ 
Kobinfpn, ** as a double feftival : on the one hand, we have 
refcu^d two fellow-prcatures from the voracity ef thofe mon^i^ 
fters in human (hapc; on the other hand, you have found 
your father.'* - -. 

. Friday had no occafion to be exhorted to rejoice ; indeed, 
his heart had never experienced fuch joy befbre, and he 
ihewed it continually, by fmging, jumping, and Inughingii 
all the while that be performed what he had to do with equal 
diligence and exadnefs. Chearfulnefs and gaiety, far from 
being a fault, is ever an amiable quality, ^hen, inllead of 
snaking us abfent and negledful, it chears us in our lubours. 

The two guefts now awoke. Although they Oill felt fomc 
pain, y^t they' foimd themfelves confiderably relieved, and 
able, with the afliftanceof Robinfon and Friday, to rife and 
£t at table. The old Indian feemed as much flruck and 
ailoijiiihed at ^very thtng that he beheld as his fon had 
formerly been on his firfl feeing the effects of European in* 
duflry. 

Friday a^ed as interpreter in the converfation that hit

Mr.BiU. No; bac the Spaniard^ Wlio kad been iix 
months amongft die favages, could 'fpcfaktke laagoa^ ef 
Friday's country tolerably well, fo that be could aSdetilaiid 
bim. The following is the fubflance of Ihs account r 

•* Our (hip was N)und to the Coaft of Africa for Arves. 
^We were returning from thence, having exchanged aM otir 
roods for gold duft, elephants teeth, and negroes. Wfe 
Sad taken a hundred flaves on board, and were cafryiiig 
them to Barbadoes to fell them : twenty of tiiem died on 
account of our flowing them too clofe one upon another. A 
violent gale of wind, whidi lafted fevcral days,'drove us out 
of our courfe, and carried us towards the COaft of BrafiK 
Our (hip fprung a leak, j(b that we durft not eruft onriel'ves 
put to fea again, but coafled along the main land* Suddenly 
we were attacked by another gale from the Weft, that carried 
us off the coaft, and, in the night, we ikuck upon ibme 
jocks not far from an )iland. We fired feveral gnna, and 
liade other Signals of diftreis, being vefelved hot toqmtdit 
ihip until the laft extremity. We fet the blacks freoi that 
they might aiGft us in pumping, as the ihip leaked m 
^Eiore places than one ; but the moment they faw themfelvet 
at liberty, they, w^th one accord, feized our boats, hemm 
determined, by means of them, to iave their Mves^ asid 
cfcape from theii* mafters. 

•* What could we do ? It was impoffible for us to have re* . 
eourfe to force ; we were but fifteen againft £[>ur*fcore, and, 
befides, the greateft part of them were armed. On the o« 
tber band, Iww could we think of remaining on board 8 
wreck without a fmgle boat ? This would hate been expofing 
ourfelves to certain death. We remonftrated with them, 
and even entreated tliem ; we endeavoured, by our fupplt- 
cations, to prevaiTon thofe, who had lately been our fiaves^ 
cither to remain with us or take us with them. Here I 
cannot help fpeaking in the higheft terms of ^ humanity 
and generofity of thefe blacks. Though they had received 
the moft rigorous treatment from us, yet they were mdvect 
with compaffion, and fufiered us to get into the boau, an 
condition that we gave up our arms. We jumped in, there* 
fore, difarmed, and the boau were fo overloaded that wft 
txpeAed to fmk every momeikt. 

<< However, we^id every thing in our power to retdi thr ^ 
iiUnd, butfnddenly the mud c£mged, aadeartiel mmk 
tQ fea in fpite of the Ubotioitt exertions of the rcMfccs* 

Our 



R O B I » S O H € fL V S O E. %i^ 

Our deftru^on naw appeared no longer a majtter of doubt : 
nevertheless, the boats, though wetloadcd a^d toft about by 
the moft violent waves, ftill had the ^ood fortune to hve ; 
and, contrary to all expedation, without loiing a Angle 
man, we were carried to an iiand perfcdlly unknown to u$* 
where the inhabitants, fimpleand humane, received us with 
the moft hofpitable benevolence. 

** We have lived with them eyer iince, in thcJbeft manner 
we could, but ftill very indifferently. Thefe poor lavages 
have nothing theWelves to fubfift on but fiftiing, and a Hsw 
fruits which the ifland produces fpontaneoufly. They fliarei 
their little ftock of provifions with us chearfilly, and ftiewed 
tts their manner of fiftiing, that we might ourfelves provide 
a part of our fubfiftence. The negroes were not fo ill off as 
we, both bccaufe they were accuftomed nearly to the £aaft 
way of living, and alfo becaafe they had recovered their 
freedpm. 

** Some days ago, this ifland was invaded by auction of 
neighbouring Indians. Every one took up ^arms^ and wt 
(hould have thought ourfelves wanting in the n^oft effential 
duty of (bciety if we had not affifted j^e^ple from whom we 
had received fuch friendly entertainment. I foufHt by li» 
fide of this brave old man, who, like an estag^ iien^ tiurcw 
himfelf into the hotteft of the combat, i iaw him fttrrbilA&^ 
ed, and uouldhave refcued 1dm, botlmd die Msfortone ti 
be made prifoner along with him* ! 

'* In this dreadful cajptivity we paffed tm Aays and tii% 
nights, bound hand and foot, without receiving ajay vouriih- 
ment. They now and then threw us pieces cil^ikii^ %^t 
fuch as the fea left dead on the beacii ; and thefe they daft to 
us with as much difdain as if we had been the viltft of aid^ 
mals. 

' < This monung, at break of day, we were dragjged to ^ 
canoes in order to be conveyed to the place where the|b1)air* 
barians were accuftomed to devour their victims. Providence 
brought you to our afliftance ; generous men ! you delivered 
US ; ft) that we have received more at your hands^ than ever 
we (hall be able to repay you.'' 

Here the Spaniard was filent; being penetrated with 
gratitude, he ftied abundance of tears. Robinfon, for Ids 
part, was deligJited to find that his former conjediures were 
aniply confirmed, and Friday joined him in admirkig the 
wiidom and goodnefs of Providence.

The Sp^mard* pa being aiked who owned tlie ihip's cargo> 
tn(Wered« that the veflcl had been fitted out by two merchants 
of Cadiz ; that one of them had given an order for the piir« . 
chafe of flaves, but tht other, detefting this traffic, deiired 
to have gold-dull in return for his goods. 
^ Upon this, Rohinfon took the Spaniard by the hand, led 
him to his cellar, then to the florehoufe, and ihewed him the 
>K>(1 valuable effe£^t of the wreck fafely ftowedin both places. 
Friday took upon him to recite the ptrtiortjtfs concerning 
them, and the Spaniard was fo ilruck;with aiionifhment that 
ke could fcarce utter a word. 

Robmfon enquired alfo in refpe£l to the owner of the 
Almonds and the officer's drefs. He was told that they 
J|l€ie both part of the efFe^s of an Englifh officer^ who, 
laving refided many years in the £afl Indies, was returning 
lb -Eneland, but, falling iick on his way*homei he defirea 
to be let aihore on the coaft of Africa^ where he died, and 
Ks eSe&s were put on board the Spanilh (hip to be conveyed 
to Barbadoes, whence they ivere afterwards to be fent to 
England. . 

Kobinfoa ihewed him alio the papers that he had taken

luune of the merchant to whom the gold-dud belonged, and 
idib that of the officer's widow to whom the diamonds and 
deaths ihould be reflored. From that moment Robinfon 
lo^ed upon the gold^duil, the diamonds^ and the papersj^

His heaid was fcarce withinHde of the hole, uhezr, by the ' 
feeble light of the lantern, he perceived aa objeA whicb 
really made him (hudder; nevenhelefs he dvd not riui away* 
Holding his lantern farther in, the better todifcover this^uiir 
kno^^nmonfter, he found it to be a lama that was dying of 
old age. Looking round, and perceiving no other anima) 
but this harmlefs lama;, he crept entirely into the cavern^ 
and bid Friday follow him. 

-The poor fellow was all o£ a tremble, yet he could not 
think of abandoning his mader ; he, therefore, made a no- 
ble effort to overcome his fear, and, in (hort, had the cou- 
rage to creep into the hole after him, where he faw with 
adoniihment how much his fright had deceived him with re- 
gard to the great fiery eyes ai^d huge throat of the inimaU ^ 

As he entered, Robinfon faid to him, foiiling, *• Well, 
Friday, you fee what fear can make us believe, Now^i 
where are the great blawng eyes ? Where is that prodigious 
throat ihat you faw ?** 

F^/J. And yet I really thought I faw them j nfiy I could 
have fwom jt. - ? . . 

Ro6. That you thought fo I have not the lead doubt ; but 
you ought to have 'kno>yn how deceitful fear is, and that its 
deluiions make us feem t6 fee a thoafand things which new 
verexifted. Believe me, Friday, it is the foundation of alT 
ftories concerning ghofts, and I know not ^liat idle fancies of 
the Jame fort. The firil tellers of thefe abfurd tales were 
fearful old women, or cowardly men of the fame ftamp. 
They imagined, like you, that they faw fomething which 
they did not fee ; and, like you too, juft now, they ^ould 
have fworn that ihey faw what they did not fee. Be H 
man, Friday f for the future always look twice ; and bani(h 
from your breaft this fearfuliiefs,, which would be fcarce 
e>ccufable in a girl. Friday promifed to do his bell. 

While they were talking^ the dd lama expired. Robin* 
fbn and Friday dragged itout of the hole, in order lo bury it. 
They next more attentively examined the fpol where dsey 
were, and found it to be a very fpacious and agreeable cave^ 
which they might in future turn to advantageous ufo. It 
Appeared as if hewn oiit by defign : it was cool widioot the

.At thefe agreeable tidings RobinTon took his profpefl glafs^ 
and hadened to the top of the hillock. With his aaked eye 
he could perceive at a diihuice a boat making fail Ntowaixk 
his ifland ; hut when he put the profpe(5^ glafs to his eve> 
the joy that wa* in his countenance difappeared* and he /aid 
to Friday, fhaking his head» " I doubt whether thofe are the . 
people that we wifh for." Friday at thefe words turned ; 
pale. 

Robinfon looked at the obje£l a fecend time, and his doubt 
was .now changed intouneafmefs. At laft, being convinced 
that they were not his friends who were in the boat, he com-, 
municated his alarms to .Friday, who was already much dlf- 
quieted. • 'M y friend, *'iaid he," they are neither the Spaniards: 
nor your father ; it is an £ngli(h boat, with Engliih failors ia 
it." . Friday began to tremble from head to foot;. ♦* Follow 
me," laid Robinfon, taking the road to an eminence from 
whence they could better difcover the Northern coaft. 
Scarce had they reached it and looked oat to fea, when they 
were fl^-uck motionlefs, and, as it were, petrified A\ith afloniih- 
me^nt. They perceived, at the diflance of about a couple of 
leagues, a large Engliih fhip lying at anchor. 

Surprife, fear, and joy, feized Robinfon's breaft by turns : 
joy, at the fight of a fhip which might perha)>s carry him to 
his own country ; furprife and fear, becaufe he could not con- 
ceive what had brought an Englifh (hip upon thefe coafts* 
It could not be ^ florm ; the weather had been quite calm 
for fome weeks. Nor could the fhip's courfe have occaiion- 
ed her to come that way. What reafon could the captain 
have for failing towards parts of the world where the Engliih 
have neither fettlements nor trade ? He apprehended^ tl^rc- 
fore, that they might be pirates. 
Henry, What are they ? 

Mr. Bill. There are men to be. found, who have been ib 
ill inflrudted in their earlier years as not even to know that 
theft IS a crime. Thefe wretches make no fcruple of taking 
away other people's property* either by fraud or violenc^t 
Jf they do this on land, they are called tbie'veu or rMers 5

Etl<w. But thefe were EngHihmen. 
Mr. BilL So they appeared to be, it is true ; but it wat

and they retired in order to oUenre, at a diftance> dioib who 
were coming in the boat> and endeavour to difcover tbdr

Robinfon and Friday pofted themfelves on a riling ground 
that was covered with trees and underwood, from vtS^ncCf 
without being perceived, they could have an eye upon what- 
ever paflTed. They faw the boat, with eleven men in it, 
come to land at a part of the (hore that wtLS fmooth and fandy 
and about a mile from the place where they were^ The 
ft-angers landed ; eight of them were armed, and the other 
three tied neck and heels. Thefe they unbound as foon as 
they were upon the beach. By the countenance and anions 
of one of them in particular, they judged that he was foli- 
citihg the compaffion of thofe who were armed : he fell at 
their feet in the pofture of a fuppliant. The other two now 
and then lifted up their hands to Heaven, as if to implore 
fuccour and deliverance. 

Robinfon, fhocked and grieved at diis fight, knew not what 
to refdive on : meantime, Friday approadied him with an 
air of triumph, and whifpered,** Well, I find, n»after, your 
countrymen eat their prifoners too.** *' Pfhaw I" faid Ro- 
binfon, a little out of humour, «* they will do no fuch thing :*• 
and he continued to obferve them with his profpe£l glais.

Mr. BilL Powder and balh RoUnfim thought proper t# 
ftay upon the fpot and obfenre what pafled. Friday kivitt|^ 
performed his errand, and ail the fire-arms being charged^ 
they observed with fatisfacHon that the faiiors, being fcattcred 
about, were lun down in the (hade, here and there, to fleq)^ 
during the violent heat of the noonday: Rolnnibn, having 
waited a Quarter of an hour, advanced confidently towards the 
three priloners, who ivere ftiU iittmg in the fame fpot with 
their backs to him. When Robinfbn, approaching them, 
called out fuddenly, *« Who are you ?" they were all three 
thunder-fticuck. 

They ftarted up, and were going to run away ; but Ro- 
.l>infon bade them fear nothing, for he was come to alii ft them« 
«' You are, then, fcnt from Heaven," faid one of them, ta- 
king off his hat refpedfully, and furveying him with the great- 
eft aftonifhment. '' AUafliftance comes from Heaven," re- 
plied Robihfon ; <* but, not to loie time, tell me in what con- 
fifts your diftrefs, and how I can relieve you." " I am cap- 
tain of that (hip," faid one of them; then pointing to his 
companions, ** this," continued he, ** was ray mate, and 
that gentleman a paftenger. My failors mutinied and feized 
the Slip ; their intention at firft was to kill me, and thele 
my two companions, for finding fault with their behaviottr : 
however, they have at length yielded to our entreaties> and 
fpared our lives ; but this boon is almoft as bad as death it* 
Icif, I'hey expofe us on this defert ifland, where, being in 
'Want of every thin^, we are fure to perith miferably." 

'' On two conmdons," faid Robinfon, *' 1 will rifk my

** Generous man ! let us but know wjxat ^y are, ** faid 
itBt captain. 

«* They arc thefe : While you remain upon this iiland, you

loid diTperfed one from die other: come, let us try and mafier^ 
them without fpilling any blood." 

They fet forvvard. Friday carried with him the cords which 
liad been taken off the three prifoiaer«. The firft Tailor that 
tkey came ud to lay . with hi« face to the ground, and 
flept Co foandly that they feized him by thib hands and feet« 
and crammed a handkerchief into his mouth, before he wm 
we]i awake. They tied his hands behind his back, and com- 
manded him to remain on the fpot without itirring an inch, or ^ 
making the leaft- noife, on pain of being put to death that 
moment. They m'4dc him turn his head towards the fea, 
that he might not obferve what was paifing amongCi his 
comrades. 

The fecond met with the fame treatment ; he was tied^ 
hand and foot, turned, and threatened in the fame manrfer. 
-Foriunc, or.'more properly fpcaking. Providence appeared 
-on this occafion the protestor of innocence and avenger of 
villainy. Six of them were now tied, but the two laft awoke, 
' ilarted up, and took their arms. *' Wretches 1" cried Ro- 
binfbn to diem, '* fee where your companions lie ; be aifured 
•we are fuperior to you in force ; lay down your arms this 
very inflant ; the leaft delay may coft you your lives !'* 

They threw down their arms, and, in their turn, fell 
fipon their knees to entreat their captain's pardon. Their 
hands being tied in the fame manner as thofe of the reH^ 
they werp all conduced to the cavern wiiich had been 
lately difcovered, there to be confined. They were then 
informed that the guard who was to have the care of them 
would fhoot the firil man through the head who fhould at- 
tempt to come out at the door. J t was alfo thought expedi* 
ent to take their knives away. 

After this, Robinfon and Friday, with their new friends^ 
went down to the boat ; they drew it up on the beach, and 
bored holes in its bottom to render it for the prefent unfit 

Htnry. Why did they do fo ? 

Mr. Bill. They forefaw, that, when the firfl boatdid not 

return, the people aboard would fend a fecond. They chofe, 

therefore, to put it out of their power to -take back the 

4rft. 

What they expedled happened accordingly. About three 

. o'clock in Ihe aAernoon, the ihip fired a gun for the Tailors 

who were on ihorcto returp. T^> fignai not being obeyed, 

« ^ though 



ROBINSON CRITSOE* 2^1 

though thrice repeated, they faw another boat put off from 
the ihip towards the Ufand. Robinfbii) with hifi companions, 
retired to ^ lifing graund, in order from thence to obferve 
v^at meafures circumftances might require them to purfue. 

The boat having come to land, the men jumped out and 
ran to the firft, but were not a little furprifed to fee it 
drawn up a good way on the beach, and with holes in its 
bottom. They looked all round, and called their compa- 
nions by their names, but nobody anfwered. They were 
ten in number, all well armed. 

Robinfon, being informed by the captain, that, smongft 
thofe whom they had made prifoners, there were three who 
from fear alone had joined m the mutiny, feot Friday and 
the mate for them immediately. On their appearance, the 
captain, to whom Robinfon had communicated his deiign, 
after reproach* ng them a little for their behaviour, a&ed 
them, whe'her, if he fhould pardon them, they would re- 
main faithful to him for the future, •* To the lail moment 
of our lives,'* they faid, trembling, and falling on their 
knees. ♦* Before this mutiny," continued the cajptain, *.* I 
always took you for honefl men, and am willing to believe 
that you were forced to take a part in it. 1 hope, how- 
ever, you will make amends for the paft by being Heady 
and faithful in future." The three failors, heartily repent- 
ing of their folly, (bed tears of joy on being forgiven. 
The captain gave them back their arms, and de fired them 
to yield a pundual obedience to their common chief. 

In the mean time, the people of the fecond boat were 
continually calling out, and now and then firing their guns, 
with the expe^sttion Uiat their fcattered comrades would 
Jiear and join them. At laft, finding all their refearches 
* ufelefs, and the day now drawing to a clofe, they began to 
fear for themfelves ; they put off, therefore, intending . to 
lie at anchor 'al)out a hundred yards from the ihore. The 
captain and Robinfon were apprchenfive left diey fhould go . 
back to the fhip, and the crew fhoulA take the rdbltition ^ 
of fetting fail and gpin^ off with- the veffel, and not wait i 
longer to /carchffar their ftrayed companions. This ap- > 
pl'ehenfitm^ filled Robinfon and the refl with much anxiety. 
: Luckily a thought ffrtick him, from which ihey promifed 
themfelvcs great fuccdfs. He order^ Friday and one of 
tMe failors to go behind the thickets, about a mile from^the 
boat, and anfwer the men wkes&ever they called ^ iheiu- a& (oc^w. 

O " — *r 



46 they |)epceived tliat tlie others heanl them^they were to gB^ 
fardief m by degrees aaiongft the imdrrwood, in order to 
4iraw the failors after them to as great t tliftance as poflible 
from fliore ; and^ having done t^ Friday and the failor . 
were to return as quick as chey could by another way^ 

This ftratagem fucceeded eompletely. No iboncur. cUd 
xhe Tailors in the boat hear a voice anA^r them, than they 
iiaftened to land again, aad^ taking their muikets, ran to- 
wards that quarter from whence they heard the voice. Twwit 
were left to euard the boat. 

Friday and his companion performed their part admira- 
bly. They drew the Tailors after them amongfl the Uiick- 
ets about three miles from the fhore> and then they hailened 
back with all (peed to join their commanders. In the 
mean time Robinfon had unfolded to the captain Ins whole 
plan for maflering theie people without bloodihed. 

Night now came on* and it grew hy degrees darker and 
darker. Rbbinfon and his companions advanced iilentiy 
towards the boat» till within about twenty yards of it, un- 
perceived by the two iaildrs who guarded it ; then 
they all (hewed themfelves at once, and, with much noife 
and clattering of their arms^ threatened the two men with 
inftant death if they dared to ftir a flep. They begged, 
fer quarter, upon which Robinfon^s party went up to them* 
and tied iheir hands. This done, they made hafte to draw 
up the boat to a confiderable diilance from the water, led 
away their two prifoners, aad concealed themfelves behind 
the bufhesj to wait for the return of the other failorjs. 
They came back ibaggling .one after another, and all ex- 
ceedingly ^tigued with their unfuccefsful expecUtion. Their 
aftonifhrnent and vexation at not finding the boat is impof- 
fible to be expreflfed. As fooa as there were five of them 
together, one /of thofe who had been pardoned was fent to 
them to aik whether they chofeto lay down their arms and 
furrender that moment without murmuring ; adding, that* 
in cafe of their refufal, the governor of the ifland had pofted 
a detachment of fifty men not thirty yards off, whole fire 
could not poffibly xRib them though it was dark ; that tlie 
governor's people had already taken their boats, and made 
all the reft .«f their compamons pnibners ; fb that there 
was :no ^ho»!» left them but either to furrender or die. 

At j^fi fame time Robinfon and his company made n 
latteri^ widi Am aoni* to confyrm Ar iaiior's accoonc 



KOBINS'OH CRUSOX. 253 

of Aeir tiamber. '* Can we hope for pardon ?^ (sad one 
of them. The captain, who was enieen» anfwered^ ** Tho- 
mas Smith, yoa laiow my toice^ lay down your arms in« 
ftantly, and yoa ihall all have your lives fpared, lex^pc At- 
kins/' He, itfeems, was the principal ringleader of the 
mutiny. 

Thev all immediately direw down their arms. Atkins 
begged for mercy, entreated the capuun's coin[mffiiHi> and 
repmented to him that he was not more guilty than' Ae reft. 
The captain anfwered him, that all he could do was to in- 
tercede for him with the governor^ and he muft wait the ef-^' 
fed of that interceffion. . Then Friday and the three failors 
were fent to tie their hands ; and the other three mutineers 
returning at the fame time from their' ramble among th^ 
thickets, they were informed of what had paiTed, and, drop- 
ping all thoughts of refiftance, fubmitted to be tied with the 
reft. 

Upon this, Robinfonj; as one of the govemor*s officers^ 
came forward to the prifoners. The captain, who accohipa- 
nied him, chofe out thoTe whom he thought capable of a iin- 
cere repentances thefe were fent to be lodged near the en- 
trance of the dwefling- place ; the others -were put into the 
cavern. Amongft thofe who had been put there before, 
there were two whom the captain thought to be equally diA. 
pofed to return faithfully to their duty, and thefe were or- 
dered to be brought to hioi. 

To-morrow evening, my dear children, you fhall have the 
lequel of this adventure. 



THIRTV»PIRST EVENING. 



/^R> BltL, My dear childreti, we now draw near th^ 

conclufion : Robinfon's \o\ will foon be decided : a few 

horns more and our friend will know whether he is fen- 

tenc^d to remain in hisifland without hopes of quitting it* 

O2 ^^ 



a54 THE *H E w 

m whether he ihall be able to gratify his moH «arneft wifk 
of again feeing his parents. 

. Tiiifi depends -on the captain's fuccefs. Will he, or will 
lie noty witb the afliilance of the failorfi who have returned to 
their duty, be able to make hixnfelf mafter of die ihip ? If 
he can, all our friend's anxiety will be at an end ; if not, 
things will remain as they are, and he muft not think of leav- 
ifig the ifland. 

Thofc whofe lives had been prpnufed theax, were lodged, 
afi before meiv^ioned^ near the entrance of the dwelling-place; 
ihey were ten in number. Robinfon informed thenu as 
from the governor^ that their offence being mutiny, they 
Siould not receive a full pardon, but on the condition of 
afliiHng their Jawful commander to recover pofTeflion of 
his ihip> Tliey all protefted that they would perform this 
condition wth the greatejd chearfulnefs and ficfelity. Ro- 
Jbinfon added, that, if diey acquitted themfelves properly of 
this iufl and reafonable duty, they would not only exempt 
themltlves from all manner of punifhment, but alfo fave the 
lives of their comrades in {N-ifon, who, if the ihip was not re- 
covered that very night, were all to be hanged the next 
morning at break of day. . 

This was alfo told to the prifoners : they were then left 
together for a while, that, in this interview, the criminals 
threatened with fpeedy death might confirm the others in 
their fidelity^ which was the only poflible means that could 
fave their lives. 

In the xpean time, the (hip's carpenter was ordered im- 
mediately to repair the boat that had been fcuttled ; and, as 
foon as this was done, they launched them both, t It was 
agreed, that the captain ihould command one, and the mate 
the other* the crew being equally divided between thenu 
Everyman was provided with arms and ammunition. Ro- 
binfon took the captain by the hand, and wilhed him good 
fuccefs. The two boats now fet fail. 

£ikv. I wonder that Robinfon did not go with them. 

Mr. J^iiL It was not for want of courage; but prudence 
did not permit him to go upon this expedition. The pri- 
fonjers in his abfej;\ce ^ight efcape, and make themfelves 
mafters of his dwelling-place^ ^ This, being his only retreat 
in cafe of danger^ and containing all his refources, was of 
too tnnch confequence to him that he fhould imprudently run 
the rifle of lofing it. The captain hinfelf faw the propriety 

of 



ROBINSON CRirSOE. 255 

of this confideration, and was of (pinion that Rcbinfon and 
Friday (hould ftay and guard their little fortrefs. 

Robinfon, whofc deltiny was now going to be decided, 
felt an anxiety and agitation of mirvd that did not futfcr hisfi 
to reft. 

Sometimes he (at down in the cave, fometimes he walked 
about upon'the terrace, and fometimes he went up the lad- 
der of ropes to the top of the hillock, to take advantage of 
the filence of the nigjit, and liften whether any thing was to 
be heard from that quarter ^*4ierc the (hip lav. Though he 
had fcarce taken any nourifhrnentthe Whde^day, he couli 
not prevail upon himfelf to do it ilOw. Hi»* anxiety wa» 
contmually encrealing, becaufe he e^tpefted the iignal thac 
had been agreed upon between them : Aree gtins. were tQ 
be the token of the capt^n's fucccfi, and it was* already mid- 
night. He at length reflefted, that he wa^ wrong to fluftui- 
ate between hope and fear,fo tfemhlhtglj atitK to both.; and 
he feafonably recotleded aiiiaxiin with which he had, not 
Ion? ago, endeavdured to fortify his nian Friday. '' In a 
doiXtful caie," faid he, *', always cxpcA the worft. If diis 
worft does not happen, fo much the better for you ; if it does, 
you are prepared tor it, and have already dcftroyed half it» 
power to hurt.'* 

. Confequently, Robinfon confldered as indubitable the iH 
fucceis of the expedition. He muftered up sdl his fortitude 
and refignation to Providence, to enable hun to fupport thii 
misfortune. He now gave up all hope — when, fuddenly, 
the deep and diftant found of a gun was heard. As if he had 
been roufed out of his fleep, he liftens— ^a fecond report 
-—then a third ! There is no longer any room for doubt i 
the capuin has recovered the (hip, and will very fpeedily fet 
fail for Europe. 

Intoxicated with joy, he flies, he Aides down the ladder, 
throws his hands round Friday's neck, who lay afleep upoa 
the graffy flope of the tert-ace ; he prcfTes him to his bofom, 
and bedews him with his tears, unable to utter a finglc 
word. *' What is the matter, my dear mafter ?" faid Friday, 
opening his eyesf and terrified at all this hurry and fudden 
overflow of afFedion. 

*' Ah ! Friday I" was all the anfwcr that Robinfon, in the 
fiilhefs of his j oy , could return, 

** Heaven have compaffion on my poor mailer's head !"

faid Friday to himfeU; imagining him to have loH hm' 
Ibifes. 

. *^ You muft ^0 to bed, my dear raafter/^and at the feme 
time he was takmg hiiti by the arm tb lead him to the cave^ 
Robinfon, in a tone of voice which expreiTed his tranfport, 
cried> •« Me ! me to bed I Friday, at the very moment 
when Heaven i^ crownbg the only wifti thatmy heart hlanK 
cheriihed fa long I Did yoa not hear the three guns ^ Know 
yon not that thty are htp^y matters of the ihip ? ' ' 

Friday » On Mng inioinned of this fbrta&ate evtnt^ rejoic- 
ed, it is trtie/biSt mdre on his matter's accoam thftn hin* 
own. The thoughts of ibon quitting his native climate (br 
cver> damped th6 fattaiodion which he wottkl- biit cn vife 
have enjoyed in going with RoUnfon and hts fathei m A. 
country from i^ence To many wonderfol thlngft^ad aireadjr 
been prefented to his view, and where he expeAed toiee- 
* odiers ilitl more marvellous. 

Robinibn was never fo afield wkh. the tran^bdrts-of J9f 
jbefore. Sotetimes he ^ent opto the top of thehiltodt^ 
.thre# hindfelf on his foce, lifted up hisefestowalds the ftairy: 
.vault, and returned God thanks ioir haviH|^ at length ptxK 
jcured him the means of departing from this defert ifland : 
prefently he would go down again, (hake his dear Friday by 
Vhe handr talk of nothing bmt Piynouth aiid Exeter, and-be^ 
ginto pack up the goods. In this agitation, he psi&d th^ 
night without once thinking of repofe^ 

At the irk peep of dawn his eyes wese turned towards, 
that quarter where the fiiip lay at anchor. He waited wiitk 
impatience for the moment when broad^^ay-light fhoulti 
ghre him a full view of the inftrument Of his delivefance. 
The moment comes— Heaven ! is it poffible ? — Dreadful, 
idea W He fees, without the fmallcft room far doubt— that 
^ .the fhip is no longer there.. He fhcieks, and falls cbwhin a^ 
^WQpn« 

Friday ran to him, but was a long time be^e he coufd 
comprehend what was the matter with his mafter. At 
length, Robinfon, ftretching his trembling hand towards the 
fea, ** Look there !" faid he, with a feeble and almpft inar-^ 
ticulate voice. Friday no fooner turned hi^ iiead that way 
titan he difcovered the cauie of his maker's grief.

inelaticliory fitnation moderates and regains thb livelinefs of 
your fatisfa6tioils, Yoa all matntaiii a profound filence ; I 
will take advantage of it, and g» on. 

Robinfim (hews us here» by bis example^ how careful 
tven the beft men fhould be not to fuKsr their paffibnt to j^t 
the better of them. If he had not at firil indultred an im- 
aioderate joy, he would not afterwards hure hllen into .an 
cxceffive degree of forrow, whichentirely darkened his reafon ; 
he would have been feniible that he ought to fim)ort the 
ihock withrefignation, though itdeftroyed his deareft hopes ; 
he would have refiefled that Providence has means to rdcue 
us from diftref*, even when we think it hnpoihbler This 
refle£l:onwouldhave contributed toe re/lore him to tranquiUit)'. 
Pnc$ more, my dear children, yovt fee how much remains 
to be amended even in perfonis the mbft forwaird in the path 
^virtue. 

While Robinfoa was defpondingi and Friday endeavour* 
ing to comfort him, diey fuddenly heard a noiie at die bacft 
ofthe hillock as of feveral people walking. . Thejr rife in a* 
Ikurry, and looking on that ude from whence tlie noife came, 
tdiey were agreeably ftirprifed to behold the cap^in coming 
Kp the hillock, accobipuiied by foine of his people. Ro« 
hiohn %nmg forward totaike hxmby the hand, and hapjpenulg 
to turn hitofelf that way he percdved the fliip at anchor in » 
creek on the Wefteim 4it of die ifland. faogp whether hiir. 
grief was baniflied in a moment. This lightlafbriiied him 
at once that the captain had chanfed his fbitimt before Ae 
break of day, aitd moored the ihip in that fafe and comolo-^ 
dious harbour. 

Rol»nfon was fo oveijoyed that he could not quit dire cq>» 
tain, who onliis iide wasno lefs deHrikted. Tk«y thaideed 
and congratulated each other a thbotend times. The cap-^ 
tain related the manner of his becoming mailer of the Ihip* 
without killing or wounding a fingleperfbn. The night was 
fo dark that die mutineers never faw hiap,^mdfo made not 
the leail difficuUy in receiving thofe on bosud ttrho accompa- 
nied him. The moft refractory were going, it is true, to^ 
fiand u^Non their defence, but their rtfift^mce would have 
been vain ; they would immediately have been tverpowefed 
and laid in irons. When he had £ni(hed his recital, he in- 
dulged his feelings of gradtude to kli dieliverer : *< It is 
you/'fiddhe, wkti tears in his eyes, <'itisydo,|^enerou8

and reflored way (hip. It is now yours ; yon ihall difpofe 
both ^f that ^id me at your jpleafnre." He then ordered 
the men to lay on the taole fome refrefbments that he had 
brought from the Mp, and the whole company, with hearts 
full of joy » fat down to an excellent breakfklh 

In the mean time, Robinfon related his ilrange adven- 
turest which more than once excited the captain^s higheft 
admiration. The latter entreated Rol^infon to tell him what 
he flibuld do for him. " Befides what 1 ftipula]ted yeftcr- 
day," anfwered he, *• in return for the aflift^ce that I' 
afforded you, I have three things nwre to defirc of you. In 
the £rll place, I reqiieft you to wait the return of the Spa- 
niards and my man Friday^s father : 2dly, to receive aboard 
your fhip, not only me and my peopl^, but alfo die. Spa- 
niards, whom you will^land in dieir own country, failing to 
Cadiz for that purpofe ; lallly, to pardon the principal muu- 
neers, and to puniih them no otherwife than by letting them 
remain here on my ifland, as I am perfuaded that it will Be 
the befti way ^o reform them ►" 

The captam, having aiTured him that thefe articles fhoold 
bepundually performed, fent for the priibners,. picked out 
the moil guilty, and told them their fentence> which they 
heard with a d!egree of fatisfadion, Very well knowing that 
by law they were liable to be put to death. Robinfon, ever 
full of humanity, gave them inftrudions concerning the 
manner of procuring themfelves fubfiftence, and promifed to 
leave them what was his beft treafure in the iftand, namely 
his tools, his furniture, and his cattle. At the fame time he 
recommended to them, over and over, to put their truft in 
Heaven, to agree together, and to be induftrious, afluring 
them that the practice of thefe virtues would not a little con- 
tribute towards rendering their confinement in this iiland 
agreeable. 

He was ftill fpeaking, when Friday, out of breath, brought 
. the. pleafine news that his father was coming with the Spa- 
niards, and that they were that moment landing. All the 
company prepared to go and meet them. Friday flew to 
the fea-fide, and embraced his father again and again, before 
the red came up. 

Robinfon faw with furprife, that, among (I thofe who came 
, in the boats, there were two women. He quefUoned Thurf- 
day concerning them, who told him that they w^re natives 
whom the two Spaniards had married. . As foon as thefe tawo 
Spaniards learned that Robi&ibxi was g^g away, and in- 
tended 



R 03 IN SON CRUSOE, 259 

tended to leave fomc failors behind him upon the jflajid, thef 
requefted penniflion to remain there alfo wfith their wives> 
alledging, that, ^fter the itccounts which they had .heard of 
this iuand, they could not defire a better eftablifhment. 

Robinfon, charmed at their requeft, moft readily confent- 
ed to it. He was well pteafed that two men fhould remain 
upon his ifland, of whoni all their comrades gave the'moft 
excellent charafter, as it was poffible that they might bring 
back the mutiiieeris, with whom they were left, to a regular 
and peaceable life. With this view he refblved, to give the 
Spaniards a degree of authority over them. 

Thofe who were to be left on the ifland were fix Engr 
liihmen, and two Spaniards with their wives. Uobinfpn 
called the whole together, and declared his will to them in 
the following words : 

'* I hope lione of you will difpute my right to do as t 
pleafe with the property of this ifland an'd_ all that belongs to 
It. I wifli equal happinefs to all of you. who remain here af- 
ter me. To fecure it, there muft: be a certain order and fub- 
Ordination amongft you, which it belorigs only to me to pre- 
fcribe., I declare, therefore, that I appoint the two Spaniards 
as fubflitutes in my place, and that they fliall foj the future 
be the lawful maimers of the ifland. You (hall all pay them 
the ftridleU obedience } (hey alone fliall have poflemon of the 
little fort and live there ; they alone fliall have under theit 
care all the arms, ammunitioii^ and tools, but which they 
will lend you, whenever you have occaiion for them, provided 
you be quiet knd peaceable. In all dangers you fnaU unite 
for the cbmmon defence. Your labours bot£k in die garden 
and the field fliall be performed in common, and every crpp-' 
be equally divided amjngft jon all. Perhaps one day or o- 
ther I may have an opportunity of hearing from you. Rer- 
kaps 1 inay even refblve to c6me and fimfli my days in this 
ifland, fuch an affedlion do I feel for it even at this moment. 
Then woe be to him who flia,U have infringed myregula* 
tions ! He fliall be fliewed'no compafrion,but fet adriti m a 
flight boat^ to take his chance upomhe open fea, let the wea- ^ 
ther be everibjmfavourable." ^u. . 

- They all agreed to thefe regulattq^s^ andprcuni&d the 
moft perfeft obedience. ... . 

' Rci)infon then took an inventory of the few goods that he 
intended to carry away with him, and which were to-be im. 
siediately put on board (he fliip. They were» ifl» the dre<^

IWAfon and Friday prep^ed a dinner,. \iy way of entertain, 
toedt before their departore,, for; the captain tvA> thofe whd^ 
were to compofe the future colony on the ifland. They 
lerved up the beft of every thing that was amortgft their pro- 
viiions, and the viduals were fo well prepared, » that the- 
taptain could not fufEciently admire Robmfon's {kill in entrr^- 
taining his company. The captain,; to imiute the g^nero- 
fity of his hofl, and to contribute in fome meaAire to the weU 
jfare of the new inhabitants oi^ the ifland, ordered a quantitjr 
cf provifions to be brought from the fhip, together with 
gunpowder, iron, and working tools» all wli^oh he befbwed 
as a prefent on the colony. 

Towards evening, kpbinfon made his excufes,.and b^ged'- 
permiffion to be alone for an hour, alledging diat there re- 
laained fome important buitnefs which he wifhedto fettlt* 
before his departure. Every one withdrawing, he went td 
' the top of the hillock; there he revolved in his mind the

the ifland^ and his heart, full of the livelidl filial gratitiKicr 
opened itfelf in thanki^vin^ to his Supreme Benefador. 
How fiiall I exnrefs his pious acknowledgments ? But

Rich. Pray, ' have patience ; who knows whether foipe 
obflacle may not yet happen to hinder his departure ? 

Mr. Bill, The wind was frefh, and blew fo favourably 
that the ifland ieemed to withdraw from them very faft. As 
• long as it was in fight, Robinfon, ftanding upon the deck 
in mournful filence, kept his eyes fixed upon the fpot, 
which, from his having lived upon *t for 12 years, and ex- 
perienced and furmounted many difh^fTes there, was become 
almoft as dear U) him as his own native country. *At ]en&;th, 
having lolt fight of the ifland, and the top of its highcflfih, 
he retired into the cabin with Thurfday and Friday, in order 
to relieve the oppreiHon of his thoughts in the amufement of 
friendly con verlation. 

They had a very fine voyage, and in twenty- four days 
caft anchdr in the harbour of Cadiz, where they landed ^1 
their Spaniih paifengers. Robinfon went into the town to 
enquire for the^ merchant to* whom the barrel of gold-duft 
belonged which he had faved from the wreck. He was 
fortunate enough to find him, and to learn that the honefl 
merchant, by recovering this eold, would be extricated 
front the greateft difficulties. The lofs of his (hip had been 
tbllowed by the moft difagreeable confequences : it had 
thrown his affairs into fuch confufion that htfi^ihd. 
Henry, Failed ? how ? 

Mr. BilL When a man owes njore than he can pay, he 
gives up whatever property he has remaining to be divided 
proportionably amongft his creditors, « ho \\ms Ipfe each' of 
them more or lefs ;. and in this cafe a man- is faid to be* 
come bankrupt, or to fail. 

The barrel of gold-duft was more than fufficient to pay 
off' the merchant's debts. Penetrated with gratitude, he 
wi(hed to beftow the remainder upon his benefador. Ro- 
• binibn, far from accepting it, declared that he was already 
too well rewarded in the latisfadlion of having prevented the 
ruin of an honeft merchant. 

From Cadiz they fet fail for England. In this part of 
the voyage a melancholy event happened. Thurfday fell 
fuddenly ill ; all the affiAance that coold be given him wa9 
of no fervice. You may imagine what Friday fufftred, and 
what was his excefs of grief on the death of a father whom

my father I" — " My dear fon I" — was all that they could 
fay. Throbbing and fpeechlefs, they remained fome time 
locked in each other's arms ; at length, a feafonable flood 
of tears relieved both their brealb., which were almofl fuffb- 
cated with joy. 

Friday, whom the multitude of different objedb that he 
faw filled with furprife, was ftari»g al^oiit in filence. His 

Ses could never have enough. The firft' day he faw no- 
Lng» 1 may fay : he was dazzled, confounded, and couGl 
£x pn ho obje^. 

In the mean time, the noife of Robihfon Crufbe's retura 
and his furprifmg adventures was fpread rapidly through the 
city of Exeter. He was the ible fubjed of converfetibn, and 
every body crouded to fee him, every body defired to hear 
jhim relate his adventures himfelf. . His father's houfe was 
for ever full of people, and Robinfon was employed m re- 
lating his Hory from mornine to evening ; in the courfe of 
which he never forgot to adoJ-efs to the fathers and niothers 
who heard him jthe following exhortation, '* If you love 
your children, I pray you, teach them, in their early years, 
to be godly, fober, and laborious :" and if there happened 
to be young perfons priefent, he was careful to give them 
this wholeiome advice, "My deaf children, obey your 
parents and your teachers ; learn diligently whatever you 
have a capacity to learn ; fear God, and be \:areful — oh, be 
careful to avoid idlenefs ! It is the mother of every vice.'* 

Robinfon's father was by profeflion a brewer > and he wifhei 
to fee his fon apply to bis own bufinefs, in ord^r t& take it 
up after his death ; but Robinfon, long accallomed to the 
pleafure of manual labour, begged his. permilTida-to learni 
the trade of a carpenter, and his father not oppofing hh 
inclination, he put himfelf, together with Friday, apprentice 
to thiit bufmefs, in which they made fuch proficiency, that, 
before the end of the year, they could work with as miicli 
S^atnefs and difpatch as any of the trade ia Exeter. 

After fbme time, they opened the bufinefs in partnerfhip^ 
and during .their whole iiv^ remained faithful friends and 
infeparable companions. Induftry and fobriety were- fo much 
afecond nature to them, that they could not have pafTed eveiv 
hsilf a day in idlenefs or loofe living. In remembrance of 
their former folitary way of Ufe^ they pitched upon one day

ifiand^ as far as that'conld be done. CoBCOrd'between them* 
ielves, indulgence for the faults oiF others, beneficence towards 
thofe whom they knew> and humanity to all men, were virtnes 
fo habitual to them, that they could not conceive how aiiy 
one who neglefted the pradice of them could be happy. 
They were particularly dxfHnguifhed by a p«re, fihcere, and 
aftive piety. Joy and love were feen tofparkle in their eyes, 
whenever they pronounced the name of die Supreme Being ; 
and they were in pain whenever they heard this facred name 
uttered in vain and from mere levity. Therefore, the blelT- 
ing of Heaven vifibly crowned all their endeavours. Be- 
ing always afdvely employed about foriiething ufeful,* they 
reached a very advanced age in health and pe^ce ; and the 
remote^ pofterity will refped thq, memory of two men, who, 
by their example, have fhewn to the wodd in what manner 
we may bel! work out our temporal welfare in this life, and 
our eternal hap|Hnefs in the next,
