LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I WAS born in York, in the year l632fof a
reputable family. My father was a native of
Bremen; who by merchandizing at Hull for
some time, gained a very plentiful fortune.
He married my mother at York, who received
her first breath in that country: and as her
maiden name was Robinson, I was called Ro-
binson Kreutznaer, which not being easily pro-
nounced in the English tongue, we are com-
monly known by the name of Crusoe. .
I was the youngest of three brothers. The
eldest was a lieutenant colonel in Lockhart's
regiment, but slain by the Spaniards; what
became of the other I could never learn.<<I

No charge nor pains were wanting in my
education. My father designed me for the
law, yet nothing could serve me but I must go
to sea, both against the will of my father, the
tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends.
One morning, my father expostulated very
warmly with me. What reason, says he, have
you to leave your native country, where there
must be a more certain prospect of content and
happiness, to enter into a wandering condition
' of uneasiness and uncertainty? He recom-
mended to me Agar's wish, Neither to desire
poverty nor riches; that a middle state of' life
was the most happy; and that the high tower.
ing thoughts of raising our condition by wan-
dering abroad, were surrounded with misery
and danger, and often ended with confusion
and disappointment. I entreat you, nay, I
command you (says he) to desist from these
intentions. If you will go, (added he,) my
- prayers shall, however, be offered for your pre-
servation; but a time may come, when deso-
late, oppressed, or" forsaken, you may wish
you had taken your poor deepised father's
counsel.----He pronounced these words with
such a moving and paternal eloquence, while
floods of tears ran downhis aged cheeks, that
it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions.
But this soon wore off; and a ltttle after, I in-
tbrmed my mother that I Could not settle at
.any business, my resolutions were so strong to
see. the world, and begged she would gain my
father's consent only to go one voyageSSwhich5

if it did not prove prosperous, I would never
attempt a second. But my desire was as vain
as my folly in asking. My mother passionately
expressed her dislike to this proposal, telling
me, That as she saw that I was bent on my or 'n
destruction, contrary to their will and my duty,
she would say no more, but leave me to myself
to do whatever I pleased.

I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when
one time being at Hull, I meta schoolfellow
of mine going along with his father, who was
master of a ship, to London; and acquainting
him with my wandering desires, he assured me
of-a free passage, and a plentiful share ofwhat
was necessary. Thus, without imploring. a
blessing, or taking farewell of my parents, I
took shipping on the lst of September, 1651. .

Upon'the 6th day, we came to an anchor-in
Harwich road, where we lay wind-bound with
some Newcastle ships; and there being a good.
anchorage, and our cables sound, the seamen
forgot their late toil and danger, and spent
the time as merrily as if they had been on
shore. But on the eighth day, there arose a
brisk gale of wind, which prevented our tiding
it up the river; and it still increasing, our ship
rode forecastle in, and shipped several large
seas.

it was not long before horror-g seized the
seamen themselves, and I heard the master-ex.
press this melancholy ejaculation, Lord have
mercy upu: '13, we shall all be, lost and undone:
For my part, siczk unto death,l kept my cabin,

A .6

till the universal and terribly dreadful appre-
hensions of our Speedy fate made me get upon
deck, and there I was afi'righted indeed. The
sea went mountains high : I could see nothing
but distress around us: two ships had cutaway
their masts, and another had thundered: two
more that had lost their anchors, were forced
out to the mercy of the ocean; and, to save
our lives, we were forced to cut our foremast
and mainmast quite away.

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge or
my dreadful condition? I was but a fresh
water sailor, and therefore seemed more terri-
fied. Our. ship was very good, but over-
loaded ; which made the sailors often cry out,
She will founder: words I then was ignorant
of. All this while, the storm continuing, and
rather increasing, the master and the more
sober part of the men went to prayers, ex-
pecting death every moment. In the 'middle
of the night one cried out, 'We had Sprung a
leak: another, That there was four feet water
in the hold. I was just ready to expire with
fear, when immediately all hands were called
to the pump; and the men forced me also in
that extremity to share with them in their la~
bour. While thus employed, the master espy-
ing some colliers, fired a gun as asignal of dis-
tress; and I not" understanding what it meant,
and thinking that either the ship broke, or
some dreadful thing happened, fell into a.
swoon. Even in that condition of woe, no-
oodt' minded me, excepting to thrust me asidel

with their feet, thinking me dead; and it was
3 ngeat while before it recovered.

Happy it was for us, when, upon the signal
given, they ventured out their boat to save our
lives. All our pumping had been 1n vain, and
vain had all our attempts been, had they" not
come to our ship's side, and our men cast them

.a rope over the stern. with a buoy to it, which
after great difficulty they got hold of, and we

hauling them to us, got into their boat, and.
left our ship, which we perceived sink within
less than a quarter 61' an hour; and thus I

learned what was meant by thundering at sea;
.And now the men incesSantly laboured to re--

cover their own ship , but the sea ran so high,-
and the wind blew so hard, that they, thought
it convenient to haul. in shore, which with

great difficulty and danger at last we happily

efi'ected, landing at a place called ,Crorner, not
far from Winterton light house; from whencB
we all walked to WYarmouth. where, as objects
of pity, many good people furnished us with
the necessaries to carry us either to Hull or
London.

Strange! that after all this, I did not, like
the prodigal son, return to my. father; who,
hearing of the ship's calamity, for a long time
thought me entombed in'the deep. No douht
but I should have shared in his fattejl calf, as
the Scripture expresseth it; but my wayward
disposition still pushed me on, in spite of the
powerful convictions of reason and conScientSS8

When we had been at Yarmouth three days
I met my old companion, who had given 'me
the invitation to go on board along with his
father. His behaviour and speech was altered,
and, in a melancholy manner he asked me how
I did? telling his father who I was, and how I
had made this voyage for a trial only to pro'.
ceed farther abroad. Upon which the old gen.
tleman turning to me, said, Young man, you
' ought never to go to sea arty more, but to take
this for a certain sign, that you will never pros.
per in a sea-faring condition. Sir, answered I,
will you take the same resolution? It is a dif.
ferent case, said he, itis my calling, and con.
Sequently my duty; but as you have made this
voyage for a trial, you see what ill luck heaven
has set before your eyes; and perhaps our mi-
series have been on *your account, like Jonah
in the'ship of Tarshish. But pray what are you,
and on what account did you go to sea? Upon
which, I very freely declared my whole story-';
'at the end of which-he made this exclamation,
Ye sacred poWers! what had I committed, that
such a wretch should enter into my ship, to
heap upon me such a deluge of miseries! But
soon recollecting himself, Young man, said he,
if you do not go back, depend upon It, wherever
you go, you will meet with disasters and disap-
pointments, till your father's words are fulfilled
upon you. And so we parted. -

I thought at first to return home ; but shame
opposed that good notion, as thinking I should9

he laughed at by my neighbours and acquaint-
ances. So strange is the nature of youth! They
are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to re-
pent; and so far from being sorry for thOSe
actions for which they may be accounted fools,
they think it folly to return to their duty, which
is the principal mark of wisdom. In short, I
travelled up to London, resolving upon a voy.
age, and a voyage I soon heard of, by my ac-
quaintance with a captain who took a fancy to
me, to go to the coast of Guinea. Having
some money, and appearing like a gentleman,
I went on board, not as a common sailor or
foremast-man; nay, the commander agreed I
should go that voyage with him without any
expense; that I should be his messmate and
companion, and that I was welcome to carry

anything with the, and make the best merchan- ..

disc I could. . - .
I blessed my happy'fortune, and humbly

thanked my captain for his offer, and acquaint-'-

ing my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were
sent me; the greatest part of which my dear
father and mother contributed, with which I
bought toys and trifles, as the captain directed
me. My captain also taught me navigation,
how to keep an account of the ship's course,
take an observation, and led me into the know.
ledge of several useful branches of the mathe-
matics. And indeed this voyage made me

bot-ha sailor and a merchant; for-I brought.

turn to London, almost three hundred pounds.
but in this voyage I was extremely sick, be.
ing thrown into a violent fever, through exces
sive heat, trading upon the coast from the lam.
tude of fifteen degrees north, even to the line
gttself.
: But, alas! my dear friend the captain soon
departed this life after his arrival. This was a
sensible grief to me , yet I resolved to go ano-
ther voyage with his mate, w ho had now got
command of the ship. This proved a very un-
successful one; for though I did not carry a
hundred pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so
that I had two hundred pounds left,' which I
reposed with the captain's widow, who was
an honest gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes
in this unhappy voyage were very great. For
our ship sailing towards the Canary Islands,
we were chased by a Salee rover; and in spite
of .all the haste we could make, by crowding as
much canvass as our yards could spread, or
our masts carry, the pirate gained upon us, so
that we prepared ourselves to fight. They
had eighteen guns, and we had but twelve
About three in the afternoon, there was a des-
perate engagement, whe1e1n many were killed
and wounded on both sides: but finding our
- selves overpowered with numbers, our ship dis.
abled, and ourselves too impotent to have the
least hopes of success, we were forced to sur-
render; and accordingly we were all carried
prisoners into the port of Salee. Our men
were sent to the Emperor's court to be sold11

there; but the pirate captain taking notice of
me, kept me to be his own slave.

In this condition, Ithought myself the most
miserable creature _on earth, and the prophecy
of my father came afresh into my thoughts.
However, my condition, was better than I
thonght it to be, as will soon appear. Some
hopes, indeed, I had that my new patron would
go to sea again, where he might be taken by a
Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and then
Ishould be set at liberty. But in this I was
mistaken; for he never took me with him, but
let} me to look after his little garden, and do
the drudgery of his house, and when he re.
turned from sea, would make me lie in the
cabin, and look after the ship. I had no one
that I could communicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my escape.
No Englishman, Irishman or Scotchman here
but myself; and for two years Icould see no;
thing practicable, but only pleased myself with
the imagination.

After some length of time, my patron, as I
found, grew so poor, that he could not fit out
his ship as usual ; and then he used constantly,
once or twice a week, if the weather was fair,
to go out a fishing, taking me' and a young
Moorish boy to row the boat; and so much
pleased was he with me for my dex'terity in __
catching the fish, that he would often send me"
with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and
the youth before-mentioned, to catch a dish of
fish for him.12

One morning, as we were at sport, there
arose such a thick fog, that we lost sight of the
shore; and rowing we knew not which way,
we laboured all thbe night, and 1n the morning
we found ourselves in the ocean, tho leagues
from land. How e1 er, we attained there at
length, and made the greatest haste, because
our stomachs 11 ere exceedinglv sharp and hun-
gry. In order to prevent such disasters for
the future, my patron ordered a carpenter to

of the long-boat; 111111 a ptacc behind it to

to. In short, being provided with all things
necessay, we sailed out.

When we had passed the castle, we fell to
fishing; but though I knew there was a bite, I
concealed the matter, in order to put farther
out to sea. Accordingly we ran a league far-
ther, when, giving the boy the helm, and pre-
tending to stoop for something, I seized Muley
by surprise, and threw him overbord. As he
was an excellent swimmer, he soon arose, and
made towards the boat; upon which I took
out a fusee, and presented it at him: " Muley,"
said I, "I never yet designed to do you. any
harm, and seek nothing now but my freedom.
I know you are able enough to swim to shore,
and save your life ; but if you are resolved to
follow me to the endangering of mine, the
very moment you proceed, I will shoot you
through the head." The harmless creature,
at these words, turned himself from me, and.
I make no doubt, got safe to land. Then
turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he trem-
bled at the action; but I put him out of all
fear telling him, that if he would be true and
faithful to me, I would do well by him and not
hurt him.

We then pursued our voyage: I kept to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast; but
in the dark of the evening, I changed my
course, that I might keep near the shore; and

having a fresh gale of wind, with a very plea.

Emperors of Morocco's dominions. Icon-
tinued sailing for five days successively, till
such time as the wind shifting to the southward,
made me conclude, that it".J any vessel was in
chase of me, they would proceed no farther.

After so much fatigue and thought, I an-
chored at the mouth of a little river, I knew
not what, or where, neither did I then see any
people. What I principally wanted was fresh
water; and I was resolved about the dusk of
the evening to swim ashore: but no sooner
the gloomy clouds of night begin to succeed
the declining day than we heard such barking,
roaring, and howling of wild creatures, that
one might have thought the very strongest
monsters of nature had their residence there.
P001 Xurv, who was almost dead with fear,
entreated me not to go on shore that night.
" Suppose I don't Xun," said I. "and in the
morning we should see men "he are worse
than those we fear, what then?" "0 den
we may give them the shoot gun," said he,
laughing, "and the gun make then all run

jars and bring me some. I asked him why he
would go and not I 'l The poor boy answered,
"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go
away." This, indeed, increased my affection
for the child. " 'Well, dear Xury," said I,
"we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans,
and they shall eat neither of us." I So giving
Xury a piece of bread to eat, we waded ashore,
carrying nothing with us but our arms, and two
jars for water. I did not go out of sight of the
boat, as dreading the savages coming down the
river in their canoes: but the boy seeing a low
descent or vale about a mile in the country, he
wandered to it; and then running back to me
with great precipitation, I thought he was pur-
sued by some savages or wild beasts ; upon
which I approached, resolving to perish, or
protect him from danger. As he came nearer
to me, I saw something hanging over his shoul.
ders, which was a creature he had shot, like
a hare, but different in colour, and with longer
legs ; however, we were glad of it for it proved
wholesome and nourishing meat; but what ad.
ded to our joy was, my boy assured me there
was plenty of water, and that he " saw no
wild mans."_ And greater stillwas our com.
fort when we found fresh water in the creek
where we were when the tide was out, without
going so far up into the country.

In this place, I began to hope that I should
meet some of the English trading vessels, who
would relieve and take us in.16

The place I was in, was no doubt, that Wilt:
country inhabited only by afew, that lies be.
tween the Emperor of Mo1occo's dominions
and the negroes. It 13 filled with wild beasts,
and the Moo1s use it for hunting chiefly From
this place, I thought I saw the top of the moun.
tain Tenerifi'e, in the Canaries, which made
me try twice to attain it, but as often was I
driven back, and so forced to pursue my for-
tune along shore.

Early one morning we came to an anchor
under a little point of land, but prettv high,
and the tide beginning to fiow, we lay ready
to go fu11her1n;butXury, whose youthful and
penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a
soft tone, desired me to keep far from land,
lest we should be dev;oured " For look yon-
der, mayster, and see de dreadful monster
fast asleep on de side of de hill." Accord.
ingly, looking where he pointed, I espied a
feartul monsterindeed. It was aterrible great
lion that lay on shore, covered as it were by a
. shade of a piece of the hill." Xury," said I,
"you shall go on shore and kill him." But
the boy looked amazed. " Me kill him!" says
he, " he eat me at one mouth," meaning one
mouthful. Upon 11 hich I bid him lie still, and
chat ging my biggest gun 11 ith two slugs, and a
good3 charge of powder, I took the best aim I
could to shoot him through the head; but his
leg lving 01 er his nose, the slug broke his
knee bone. The lion awaiting with the pain,
gotup, but soon fell down, giving the mostl7

hideous groan I ever heard; lint taking my
second piece, I shot him through the head,
and then he lay struggling for life. Upon this
Xury took heart, and desired my leave to go on
shore. " Go then," said I. Upon which, tak
ing a little gun in one hand, he swam to shore
with the other, and coming close to the [1011
put a period to his life, by shooting him again
through the head. _

But this was spending our ammunition in
vain, the flesh not being good to eat. Xury
was late a champion, and comes on board for
a hatchet. to cut off the head of his enemy;
but wanting strength to perform it, he cut off
and brought me a foot. Ibethought me, how.
ever, that this skin would be of use. This cost
Xury and me a whole day : when spreading it
on the top of our cabin, the hot beams of the
sun effectually dried it in two days time, and it
afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.

And now we sailed southerly, living s'par-
ingly on our provisions, and went no oftener
on shore than we were obliged for fresh water,
in hopes to meet some European ship. If Pro-
vidence did not favour me, my next course was
to seek for the islands, or lose my life among
the negroes; in a word, eitherI must meet with
some ship, or certainly perish.

One day as we were sailing along, we saw
people stand on the shore looking at us; we
could also perceive they were black, and stark
naked. I was inclined to go on shore; but
any cried, No, no; however, I approached

a 218

nearer, andI found they ran along the shore
by me a long 11 ay They had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who held along stick,
which Xury told me was alance, with which
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to
them by signs, and made them sensible I wan-
; ted something to eat; they beckoned to me to
' stop my boat, while two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than halfan hour came
back and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh, and some corn, which we kindly ac-
cepted; and to prevent any tears on either
side, they brought the food to the shore, laid
it down, then went and stood a great way 03',
till we fetched it on board, and then came close
to us again.

But while we were returning thanks to them,
being all we could afford, two Umighty creatures
came from the mountains, one as it were pur-
suing the other with great fury, which we
were the lather inclined to believe, as they
seldom appear but 1n the night, and both these
swiftly passing by the negroes, jumped into
the sea, wantonly s11imming about, as though
the diversion of the waters chad put a stop to
their fierceness. At last one of them coming
nearer to my boat than I expected, or desired,
I shot him directly through the head, Upon
which he sunk immediateh , yet rising again,
he would ham willingly made to the Shoore, but
between the wound and the struggling of the
water, he died before he could reach it.

It is impossible to express the consternation19

the poor negroes were in at the firing of my
gun; much less can I mention their surprise,
when they perceived the creature to be slain by
it. I made signs to them to draw near it with
a rope, and then gave it to them to haul on
shore. It was a beautiful leopard, which made
we desire its skin; and the negroes seeming
to covet the carcase, I freely gave it to them.
As for the other leapetrd, it made to shore,
and ran with a prodigious swit'tness out ot"
sight. The negroes having kindly furnished
me with water, and with what roots and grains
their country afforded, I took my leave, and,
after eleven days sail came in sight of the
Cape de Verd. But the great distance I was
lion) it, and tearing contrary winds would pre-

Vent me reaching them, I began to grow me-
lancholy and dejected, when upon a sudden
Xury cried out, "Master, master; ' looking as
affiighted as ifit u as his mastei's ship sent in
search of us. But I soon discovered she was
a Portuguese ship. Upon which I strove for
life to come up to them. But in vain had it
been, if through their perspective glasses, they

had not perceu ed us, and shortened their saii
to let us come in. Encouraged at this, I set
up my patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both,
as signals of distress; upon which they very
kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came

guese, Spanish, and French, but none of these
did I understand, till at length a Scots sailor20

called, and then I told him I was an English.

upon which they took me kindly on board.
with all my effects.

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or, All
Saints Bay, in twenty-two days after. And here
I cannot forget the generous treatment of the
captain. He would take nothing for my pas.
sage, gave me. twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and thirty for the lion's. Every thing
he Caused to be delivered, and what I would
sell, he bought. In short, I made 2'20 pieces
of my cargo, and with this stock I entered
once more, as I may say, into the scene of life.

To be brief, I bought a settlement next door
to an honest and kind neighbour, born at Lis.
ban, of English parents, whose plantation join.
ing to mine, we improved very amicably toge-
ther. Both our stocks were low: and for two
'years we planted only for food ; but the third
year we planted some tobacco, and each of us
dressed a large piece of ground the ensuing
year for planting sugar-canes.

I was in somemeasure settled, before the
captain who took me up departed from the Bra-
zils. One day I went to"him, and told him what
stock I had in London, desiring his assistance
on getting it sent out to me ; to which the good
gemlepian readily consented but would only
havomc send For. 155:; my money, lest it should
mist-tarry2 which, iii. did, I might still have the

V2i

remainder to support me; and so taking letters
of procuration from me, bid me trouble myself
no further about it.

And indeed, he not only procured the money
I had drawn for upon my captain's widow, but
sent me over a servant, with a cargo proper.
tionable to my condition. He also sent me
tools of all sorts, iron work and utensils neces-
sary for my plantation.

'Vealth now encreasing on me, and uncom-
mon success crowning my prosperous labours,
I might have rested happy in that middle state
of life my father so often recommended; yet
nothing would content me. Having lived four
years in Brazil, Ihad not only learned the
language, but contracted acquaintance with the
most eminent planters, and even with the
merchants of St. Salvadore, three of whom
came one morning to me, saying they had
a secret proposal to make. Alter enjoining
me to secrecy, they told me they had a mind
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to
stock the plantation with negroes, which, as
they could not be publicly sold, they would di
vide among them; and if I would go their su.
percargo in the ship, to manage the trading
part, I should have an equal share of the ne-
goes, without providing any stock. The thin
indeed was fair enough, had I been in anoth
condition : however, I could not resist the pro-
pose], but accepted the offer, upon condition
of their looking after my plantation. ,

The ship being fitted out, and all things22

ready, we set sail the first of September 1659.
'We sailed northward upon the coast, from
whence going farther into the ocean out of the
sight of land, we steered as though we were
bound for the island Fernand de N oremba, leav-

met with a terrible tempest, which continued-
for twelve days successively, so that the winds
carried us wheresover they pleased. In this
perplexity one of our men died, and a man
and a boy were washed overboard. When the
weather cleared up alittle, we found ourselves
upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this the cap.
tain gave reasons for returning; which I op-
posed, counselling him to stand away for Bar-
badoes, which, as I supposed, might be at-
tained'in fifteen days. So altering our course,
we sailed north-west and by west in order to
reach the Leeward Islands ; but a second storm
suceeding, drove us to the westward, so that
we were justly afraid of falling into the hands
of cruel savages, or the paws of the devouring
beasts of prey.

In this great distress, one of the men, early in
the morning, cried out, Land! Land! which
he had no sooner said, than our ship struck
upon a sand bank, and, in a moment, the sea
broke over her in such a manner that we ex.
pected we should perish immediately. We
knew not where we were, or upon what land
we were driven, whether it was an island or
the main, inhabited or not inhabited, and we
could not so much as hope that the ship23

mg in pieces, unless the wind by a miracle
should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expecting death
every moment, the mate lays hold ot'the boat,
and with the help of the rest got her flung over
the ship's side; into this we all got, being
eleven in number, and committed ourselves to
God's mercy, and the wild sea. And now we
saw that this last effort would not be a suffi.
cient protection from death; so high did the
sea rise, that it was impossible the boat. should
live. As to making a sail, we had none, nei-
ther if we had, could we make use of any. So
that when we had rowed, or rather were driven
about a league and a half, a raging wave, like
a lofty mountain came rolling astern of us,
and took us with such fury, that at once it
overset the boat. Thus being swallowed up
in a moment, we had only time to call upon
the awful name of God, and to implore, in
dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to receive
our departing souls.

Men are generally counted insensible, when
struggling in the pangs of death ; but while I
was overwhelmed with water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions imaginable, for the joys
of heaven, and the torments of hell, seemed
to present themselves before me in these dying.

unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to
behold my friends, nor the light of this world
any more! I strove however to the last extre-
mity, while all my Companions were over-
powered and entombed in the deep; and it was
with great difficulty I kept my breath till the
wave spent itself, and, retiring back, led me
on the shore, half dead. with the water I had
taken in. As soon as I got on my feet, I ran
as fast asI could, lest another wave should pur-
sue me, and carry me back again. But for all
the haste I made, I could not avoid it,'for the
sea came after me like a high mountain, or a
furious enemy; so that my business was to
hold my breath, and by raising myself on the.
water, to save myself by swimming. The next
dreadful wave buried me at once twenty or
thirty feet deep, but, at the same time, carried
me with a mighty force and swiftness towards
the shore, when raising mys if, I held out as
well as possible, till, at length, the water, hav-
ing spent itself, began to return, at which I
struck forward, and feeling ground again with
my feet, I took to my heels. Thus being
served twice more, I was at last dashed against
a piece of rock, in such a manner as left me
senseless, but recovering a little before the re-
turn of the wave, which no doubt would then
overwhelm me, I held fast by the rock till those
succeeding waves abated; and then fetching
another run, was overtaken by a small wave,
which was soon conquered. But before any////////?/ W / /

shore, tired and almost spent, Isat down on
the grass, free from the danger of the foaming
ocean.

No tongue can express the transports that
my soul felt at this happy deliverance. I was
wrapt up in contemplation, and often lifted up
my hands with the profoundest humility, to the
Divine Power for saving my life; when the
rest of my companions were all drowned. And
now I began to cast my eyes around, and to
behold what placeI was in, and whatI had,
next to do. I could see no house nor people ;-
I was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me;
hungry and thirsty, yet had nothing to eat or
drink, no weapon to destroy any creature for
my sustenance, nor defend myself against de.
roaring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a
knife, a tobacco pipe, anda box half filled with
tobacco. The darksome night coming upon
me, increased my fears of- heing devoured by
wild creatures, my mind was plunged in despair,
and having no prospect, as I thought, of life
before me,I prepared for anotherkind of death
than what I had lately escaped. I walkefl'
about a furlong, to see ifI could find any fresh
water, which I did, to my great joy; and taking
a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got
up into a thick bushy tree, and seating myself
so that I could not fall, a deep sleep overtook
me. and for that night. buried my Sorrows m a
quiet ropes:

It was broad day the next morning before I
awoke, when I not only perceived the tempest
was ceased, but saw the ship driven almost as
far as the rock betbrementioned, which was
about a mile from the place where I was---
VVhen I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles dis-
tent on mv right hand, lying on shore as the
u '11 es had cast her. I thought to have got to
her; but theze being an inlet of watei abou'

that I could come within a quarter ot'a mile of
her, it was to my griet'I perceived, that if we
had kept 011 hoard, all our lives would have
been saved. These thoughts and my solitude
drew tears from my eyes, though all in vain.

except a boat, which indeed was all, to carry
away what was needful for me.
Necessity occasions a quickness of thought.
We had several spare yards, a Spare topmast.

With these I fell to work, and slung as many
of them overboard as I could manage, tying
every one of them with a tope that they might
not drive away. This done,I went down the
ship's side and tied four of them fast together
at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two

considerable weight. Upon which I went to
work again, cuttinga Spare topr'nast into thtee
lengths, adding them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour band pains. I then, first laying
upon it all the planks and boards I could get,
next lowered down three of the seamen's chests
after I had filled them with bread, rice, three
Dutch cheese, five pieces ofdried goat's flesh,

and some European corn, what little the rats -

had spared; and for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles, in which were some cordial
waters, and four or five gallons of arrack. By
this time, the tide beginning to flow, I per.
ceived my coat, waistcoat, and shirt swim
away whichI had left on shore; as for my
linen breeches and stockings, I swam with them
to the ship ; but I soon found clothes enough,
thoughItook no more than I wanted for the
present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to

work with, and after a long search, I found out
the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down
on my raft. Ithen looked for arms and ammu-
nition, and in the, great cabin, found two good
fowling pieces, two pistols, several powder
horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two rusty
swords. I likewise found three barrels ol'pow-
der, two of which were good, but the third
had taken water, also two or three broken oars,

and ball, I ascended the mountain. ThereI
perceived I was in an island, encompassed by;
the sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scat.
tering rocks that lay to the west; that it seemed
to be a barren place, and, as I thought only
inhabited by wild beasts. I perceived abund.
anCe of fowls, but was ignorant of what kind,
or whether good for nourishment. I shot one
of them at my return, which occasioned a con.
fused screaming among the other birds, and I
found it, by its colour and beak, to be a kind '
of hawk, but its flesh was perfect carrion.

_ When I came to my raft, I brought my
. effects on share, which work spent that day en.
' tirely; and fearing that some cruel beasts might
' devour me in the night time while I slept, I
made a kind of hut, or barricade, with the
chests and boards I had brought on shore.
That night I slept very comfortably; and the
next morning my thoughts were employed to
make a further attempt to the ship, and bring
away what necessaries I could find, before ano.
_. ther storm should break her in pieces. Accord.
ingly, I got on board as before, and prepared
a second raft far betterrthan the first; upon

piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large
bag full of small shot. Besides these, I took
all the men's clothes I could find, a spare fore.

top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and
thus completing my second cargo, I made all y
the haste on shore I could, fearing some wild .
beast might destroy what I had there already.
But I only found alittle wild cat sitting on one 5"
of the chests, who not seeming to fear me, or. g,
the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a. :3
piece of biscuit, which she instantly ate and
departed.
When I had got theseefi'ects on shore, I v
went to work, in order to make me a little tent f
with the sail and some poles, which I had cut '3
for that purpose, and having finished it, what ,
things might be damaged by the weather,I j
brought it), piling all the empty chests and f
casks ma circle, the better to fortify it against ._.
any sudden attempt of man or beast. After -
this I blocked up the doors with some boards, ' _-
and an empty chest turned the long way out. i
I then charged my gun and pistol, and laying
my bed on the ground, slept as comfortably j
till the next morning asthough 1 had been in
a christian country. '
Now, though I had enough to subsist me a?
long time, yet despairing of a sudden deliver-i
ance, and fearing that both ammunition and pro .
vision mirrht be spent before such a thing hapu :'
pened, I saved as much as I could, and so long
as the ship remained in that condition, I daily
brought away one necessary or other; patticu
larlv, athe rigging, <<sails and cordage, some twine,
a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, abarrel
of meal, three casks of rum, and indeed wh31

was most welcome to me, a whole hogshead of
bread.

The next time I went, I cut the cables in
pieces, carried ofi'a hawser whole, with a great
deal of iron work, and made another raft; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy bur.
den upon it,'.and ,1 not being able so dexter.
ously to guide it as the former, both my cargo
and myself were overturned. For my part, all
the damage I sustained was a wet skin; and at
low water, after much labour in diving, I got
up most of the cables, and some pieces of iron..-_.-.

Thirteen days had I now been on the island,
and eleven days on board, bringing away all
that was possible. As I was going the twelfth
time, the wind. began to rise ;. however, I ven-
tured at low water, and rummaging the cabin,
in a locker, Ifound several razors, scissors and
some dozens of knives and forks, and in ano-
ther, thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight, silver.
and gold. I wrapt'the money up in apiece of
canvas, and began to think of making another
raft; but I soon perceived the wind beginning
to rise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore,
and the sky overcast Ewith'clouds and darkness.
So thinking 'a rail: to be. in vain, I let myself
mto the water with what things I had about me ;
and it was with great difficulty I got ashore
. when soonafier it blew a fearful storm, -

Thatnight I slept very contentedly in .my
little tent, surrounded with all my efl'ects; 'but '

the present: yet, when I considered that I had
lost no time, abated no pains, and had got
every thing useful out of her, I comforted my.
self in the best manner, and entirely submitted

to divine Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend

and secure myself from savages and wild
beasts, if any such were in the island.

'Vhen I considered the ground where I was,
that it was marshy, and had no fresh water
near it, my resolutions wet; to search for a soil
healthy and well watered, where I might not
only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat
but be more conveniently situated, as well to
be secured from wild men, and beasts of prey,
as more easily to discover any distant sail,
should it ever so happen.

And indeed it was not long before I had my
desire. I found a little plain near a rising hill;
the front towards which, being as steep as a
house-side, nothing could descend on me from

the top.
On the side of this rock was a little hollow

place, resembling the entrance or door of a
cave. Just before this place, on the circle of
the green, I resolved my tent should stand.
This plain did not much exceed a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, like a
delightful green before my door, with a pleas-
ing, though irregular descent every way to the
low grounds by the sea side, sheltered from the
excessive heat of sun. After this, I drew a
semicircle, twenty yards in diameter, driving33

down two rows of strong stakes not six inches
frrim each other. Then with the pieces of cable
which I had cut on board, Iregularly laid them
in a circle between the piles, up to their tops,
which were more than five feet out of the earth,
and then drove another row of piles, looking
within side against them, between two or three
feet high, which made me conclude it a lit;
tle castle impregnable by men and beasts.
And for my better securityI would have no
door, but entered in and came out by the help
of a ladder, which I also made.

Here was my fence and fortress, into which
I carried all my riches, ammunition, and stores.
After which, working on the rock, what with.
the dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised
my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house; and this cost me many days'
labour and pains. One day in particular, a
shower of rain falling, thunder and lightning
ensued, which put me in terror lest my powder
should take fire, and not only hinder my neces.
sary subsistence, by killing my food, but even
blow up me and my habitation. To prevent
which, I fell to making boxes and bags, in or.
der to separate it, having by me near 1501b.
weight. And thus being established as king of
the island, every day I went out with my gun
to see what I could kill that was fit to eat. I
soon perceived numbers of goats, but very shy ;
yet having watched them narrowly, and seeing
I could better shoot 05' the rocks than when in

O34

   
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
   

the lmt grounds, Ihappenedto shoot a she e-goat j.
suckling a }oung kid; which, not thinking its
dam slain, stood by her unconcerned; and
when I took the dead creature up, the young F;-
one followed me even to the enclosure. I lifted
the kid over the pales, and would willingly {-
have kept it alive, but finding it could not be '
brought to eat, I was forced to slay it also for -,
my subsistence.

Thus, entered into as strange a state as ever .
any man wasin,l had most melancholy appre- g
hensions concerning my deplorable condition ,
and many times the tears would plentifully run
donn my face, when I considered how I was "
debarred from all communication with human '
kind. Yet while these despondtng cogitations 5'
would seem to make me accuse Providence, '"
other good thoughts would interpose and re- ~'
prove me after this manner : " Well, supposing #f'
you are desolate, is it not better to be so than
totally perish? Why should you complain, 1';
when not only your life is preserved, but the j
ship driven into your reach, in order to take
what was necessaary out of her for a suhsis- .
tence?" But to proceed: It was, by the account ;
I kept, the thirtieth of September, when '
I first landed on this island. About twelve;
days after, fearing lest I should lose my reek. ,
oning ofttme, nay even forgetthe sabbath days
for n ant ot pen, ink, and paper, I carved with
. a knife upon a large post, in great letters, I
came on shore, Sep. 30, 16-59, and set it up in '1'35

the similitude of a cross, on the sea shore where
Handed. Every day I out a notch with my
knife on the sides of the square post, and that
on the sabbath was as longf again as the rest,
and every'first day of the month, as long again
as that long one. In this manner, I kept my
calendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning
of time. But had I made a more strict search
(as I did afterwards,) I need not have setup
this mark. For among the parcels belonging
'to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate,
Ifound those very things I wanted; particu.
"la'rly pens, ink, and paper; also I found two or
'_ three compasses, some mathematical instru.
mehts, dials, perspective glasses, books of
navigatibn, three English Bibles, and several
other good books, which I carefully put up.
'-.H'ere I cannot but call to mind our having a
.dog, and two cats on board, whom I made
"inhabitants with me in my castle. Though
' one might think' I had all the necessaries that
were desirable, yet still I found several things
wanting. My ink was daily wasting: I want.
ed needles, pins, and thread to mend or keep
my clothes together: and particularly a spade,
pick-axe, or shovel, to remove the earth. It
was a. year .before' I finished my- little bul-
wark; and having some intervalsof relaxation,
after my daily wandering abrottdfqr provision,

I must here add to the description I have
given of my habitation, that having raised a
turf wall against the outside of it, I thatched
it so close as might keep it from the inclemency
of the weather; I also improved it within, en.
larged my cave, and made a passage and a
door in the rock, which came out beyond the
pale of my fortification. I next proceeded to. .
make a chair and table, and so began to study-
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practi-
cable. When I wanted a plank or a board, I
hewed down a tree with my hatchet, making it
as thin with my axe as possible, and then
smooth enough with an adze, to answer my de-
signs; yet though I could make no more this
way than one board out of a tree, in length of
time I got boards enough to shelter all my
stores, every thing being regularly placed, and
my guns securly hanging against the side of
a rock. This made it a very pleasant sight to
me being the result of vast labour and great
diligence; which leaving for a while, and me
to the enjoyment of, I shall give the reader an

D38

account of some parts of my journal from the
day of my landing, till the settling of my habi-
. ration, as heretofore shown.

 

JOURNAL.

SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659, I unhappy Rabi...

son Crusoe, having suffered shipwreck, was
driven on this desolate island, which I named

the Desolate island of Despair, the rest of my
companions being swallowed up in the tempes.
tuous ocean. The next day Ispent in consider. :
ation of my unhappy circumstances, having no '

prospect but of death, either to be starved with

hunger, or devoured by wild beasts or merciless -

savages.

Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort 1, 3'.
beheld the ship drove ashore. Some hopes l '1
had, that when the storm was abated I might '
be able to get some food and necessaries out o! .
her; which I conceived were not damaged, ':
because the ship did stand upright. At this 3*:
time,I lamented the loss of my companions, and
our misfortune in leaving the vessel. .When I 1'

' perceived the ship, as it were, to lie dry, I waded 13'
through the sands, then swam aboard, the wea.

ther being very rainy, and with scarcely any
wind.

To the 14th of this month, my time was em.

ployed in making voyages every tide, getting
what I could out of the ship. The weather very
wet and uncertain.

_ -. ..:m--~.....--- .n--n-h-nr39

Oct. 25. My raft, and all the goods thereon
were overset; yet I recovered most again at
low water.

Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and
day, when the ship went in pieces, so that no-
thing was seen of her but the wreck at low
water. This day I secured my goods from the
inclemency of the weather.

Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I could
find a place convenient for my abode : I fixed
upon a rock in the evening, marked out a. half
moon, intending to erect a wall fortified with
piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.

N . 3. I shot two wild-fowl, resembling
ducks, which were good to eat, and in the af-
ternoon made me a table.

Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the
morning I allowed myself two or three hours
to walk out with my gun , I then worked till
near eleven o'clock; and afterwards refreshed
myself with what I had to eat. From twelve.
to two, I would lie down to sleep. Extreme
sultry weather. In the evening go to work
again.

l3N . 5. W'ent out with my gun and dog,
shot a wild cat with a soft skin, but her flesh
was good for nothing. The skins of those
killed I preserved. In my return I percieved
many wild birds, and was terrified by some
seals which made ofi' to sea.

Nov. 6. Completed my table.
N ~. 7. Fair weather [worked to the 12th40

but omitted the 11th, which according to my
calculation, I suppose ed to be Sunday.

Am). 1'" 1. I began to dig in the rock, vet was
obliged to desist for want of a picl:.axe, shot. el
andb n heel ban on. Iron crous I used to sup
ply the place of the first, but with all my art I
could not make a wheelbarrow.

Nov. 19. It was my fortune to find a tree
resembling what the Brazilians call an iron
tree. I had like to spoil my axe with cutting
it, it being very hard, and exceedingly heav *;
yet with much labour and industry I made a
sort of' Spade out of it.

No or. 23.'1hese tools being made, I daily

carried 011 mV business; eighteen day s I allou ed
for enlaiging mV care, that it might serve me,
not only fora a u are house, but kitchen, parlour
and cellal. I commonly 1:13,- 111 the tent, unless

dry. So wet would it be at certain seasons,
that I was obliged to cover all within the pale
with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and lead them with flags and
large lens as 111 trees resembling a thatch.

Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habita-
tion finished, but suddenly a great deal of the
top broke in, so that it was a mercy I was not
buried in the ruins. This occasioned a great
deal of pains and trouble to me before I could
make it firm and durable. =

Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place,
then made a sort of dresser, and aucther table.

Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats,
shot one, wounded another , E'I led it home In a
string, bound up its leg, and cured it in a little
time; at length, it became so tame and familiar
as to feed before the door, and follow me where
I pleased. This put me in mindto bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food
after my ammunition was spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exces-
sively hot, with little air, obliged me for the
most part to keep within doors.

Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time
was to finish the wall before described, and '_
search the island. I discovered a kind of pi-
geons, like our house.pigeons, in a nest among '
the rocks. I brought them home, nursed them.
till they could fly, and then they left me. At?"
ter this, I shot some, which proved excellent
food. Some time I spent vainly contriving to
make a cask, I may well say it was in vain, be.
cause I could neither joint the staves, nor fix
the hands, so as to make it tight: so leaving
that, I took some goats tallow I had by me,
and a little oakum for the wick, and pro'vided
myself with a. lamp, which served instead of
candles.

But now a very strange event happened. For
being in the height of my search, what should
come into my hand, but a bag which was used
to hold corn (as I supposed) for the fowls; so
immediately resolving to puta Gunpowder into it.

I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of
a rock, little expecting what the consequence
would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a
few days before; and about a month alter, to
my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when I
came to View it more nicely, every day as it
grew, I found about ten or twelve ears of green
barley of the very same shape and make as that
in England.

I can scarcely express the agitation of my
mind at this sight. Hitherto, I had looked
upon the actions of this life no otherwise than
only as the events of blind chance and fortune.
But now, the appearance of this barley, flour.
ishing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in
not conceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude, "that miracles were not yet ceas-
ed ;" nay, I even thought that God had appoint-
ed it to grow there without any seed, purely for
my sustenance in this miserable and desolate
island. And indeed such great effect had this
Upon me, that it often made me melt into tears
through a grateful sense of God's mercies; and
the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of barley, some
rice stalks, also wonderfully flourishing.

While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be some more com in the island;
and therefore made a diligent search narrowly
among the rocks; but not being able to find
any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I
had shaken the husks of corn out of the bag,mm-Iuaxuunn" - ..

and then my admiration ceased, with my grati.
tude to the Divine Being, as thinking it was but
natural, and not to be conceived a miracle;
though even the manner of its preservation
might have made me own has a wondeful
event of God's kind providence.

It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of the corn ripened, which I laid up very
carefully, together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice;
expecting one day I should reap the fruit of
my labour; yet four years were expired before
I could allow myself to eat any barley bread,
and much longer time before I had any rice.
After this, with indefatigable pains and indus.
try for three or four months, at last I finished
my house on the 14th of April, having no way
to go into it, but by a ladder against the wall.

April 16, I finished my ladder, and ascended
it; afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on
the other side, and descended into my new ha-
bitation, where I had space enough, and so for.
tified, that nothing could attack me without -
scaling the walls.

ButD what does all human art and industry
avail, if the blessing of God does not crown
our labours? Or who can stand before the Al.
mighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm. 7 For
one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake,
that not only the roof of the cave came tumbling
about my ears, but the posts seemed to crack
terribly at the same time. This put me in a.
great amaZcment , and running to the ladder44

and getting over the wall, I then plainly knew
it was an earthquake, the place I stood on sus-
taining three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw
the top of a great rock roll into the sea; I then
expected the island would be swallowed up
every moment : and what made the scene still
more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into
the most violent agitations and disorders by this
tremendous acciu.

For my part, I expected every moment to be
swallowed up. At the moving of the earth, I
was, as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid
lest the rock, under which was my fence and
habitation, should overwhelm me and it in a
lasting tomb.

It was not long after, when a horrible tem-
pest arose, at the same time attended with a
hurricane of wind. Three hours did this starm
continue, and in so violent a manner as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was suc-
ceeded by abundance of rain. When the tem.
pest was over, I went to my tent; but the rain
coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged
to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification, to
let the water out. It continued raining all that
night, and some time the next day. These ac.
cidents made me resolve, as soon as the wea-
ther cleared up, to build me a little hut in some
open place, walled round, to defend me from
wild creatures and savages; not doubting, but,
at the next earthquake, the mountain would45

fall on my habitation and me, and swallow up
all in its bowels.

April 16--20. These days I spent in con.
triving how and in what manner I should fix
my place of abode. All this while, I was ur'.
der the most dreadful apprehensions. 'When
Ilooked round my habitation, every thing I
found in its proper place. I had several de-
bates whether I should move or not; but at
length resolved to stay where I was, till I
found out a convenient place where I might
pitch my tent.

April 22. IVhen I began to put my resolu.
tions in practice, I was stopped for want of
tools and instruments to work with. Most of
my axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up a full week to make my
grindstone of use to me; and at last I found
out a way to turn it about with my foot, by help
of a wheel and a string.

April 30. My bread falling short, I allow.
ed myself but one biscuit a day.

'JIIay 1. As I walked along the sea-shore,
I found a barrel of gunpowder, and several
pieces of the wreck which the sea had flung up.
Having secured these,I made to the ship, wh0se
stern was torn off, and washed 2: great distance
ashore ; but the rest lay in the sands. 'This, I
suppose, was occasioned by the earthquake. I
now resolved to keep my old place of abode :
and also to get to the ship that day, but found
it impossible.46

Illa-y 3. This day I went on board, and with f
my saw sawed off one of the beams, which kept _'
her quarter-deck. I then cleared the sand till
flood. '

May 4. I caught some fish, but they were
not wholesome. The same day,I also caugh _ f
a young dolphin.

JlIayl-J 5. This day also I repaired to the f
wreck, and sawed another piece of timber- ; 3
and when the flood came, I made a float of
three great planks, which were driven ashore ,_
by the tide.

III ay 6--9. These dag. s, I brought ofl' the
iron bolts, opened the deck with the 1ron crow,
and carried two planks to land, having made a
way into the very middle of the wreck. "

May 10--13.All this time I spent in bring. 2;
ing ofi' great quantities of1ron and timber. "

JPIay 15. Took with me two hatchets on
purpose to cut off some lead from the roll, but
all in vain, for it lay too low under water. '.

Mag; 24. To this day, I worked on the ._
wreck, and with great difficulty loosened some "
things so much with the crow, that at the first ~"
blowing tide, several casks floated out, and se-
veral of the seamen's chests ; yet that dav no. .
thing came to land but pieces of timber, and a
hogshead which had some pork in it. I con.
tinued working to the 15th of June; (except
necessary times for food and rest,) and had I
known how to build a boat, I had timber and
planks enough; I had also near 100 w eight of
sheetlead.47

June 16. As I was wandering towards the
sea-side, I found a large tortoise or turtle, beg;
mg the first I had seen on the island, thongrh
as OI afterwards found, there were many on the
other side of it.

June 17. This day I spent in cookmg it,
found in her threescore eggs, and her flesh the
ianSt savory and pleasant I ever tasted in my

1 e.

June 18. I staid within this day, there be-
ing a continual rain; and it was somewhat
more chilly and cold than usual.

June 19. Exceedingly ill, taken with a
trembling and shivering.

June 20. Awake allU night, my head racked
with pain, and feverish.

Jame 21. Sick unto death, and terrified
with dismal apprehensions of my condition.
Prayed to God more frequently, but very con-
fusedly.

June 22. Something better, but still un-
easy in my mind.

June 23. Again relapsed much as before.

June 24. Mended a second time.

June 25. Aviolent ague for seven hours,
cold and hot fits, succeeded with faint sweats.

June 26. Better, but very weak , 'et I
scrambled out, shot a she goat, brought it
home, and broiled some of it: I would wil.
lingly haVe stewed. it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.

June 27. All this day I was afflicted with
an ague; thirsty, yet could not help myself to48

water: prayed to God in these words: " Lord,
in pity look upon me: Lord, have mercvupon
me, have emer' :1' upon me!" After this 1 'ell

s.eep, 1111ich,1111en I awaked, I fou" (1 had
much refreshed me.

I rose up, in a pensive manner, being so
thoughtful that Icould not go to sleep; Dand
fearing the. dieadful return 01 my distemper, it

caused me to remember. that the Brazilians
use tobnce o for almost all disee .sse I then
went to my chest, In order to find some, where
heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a cure,
both for soul and body; for there I found one
of the bibles, which, 1111 this time, Iliad neither
leisure nor inclination to look into ; I took
both the tobacco and 111 it out of my chest, and
laid them on 11101 hie. Sex oral experiments did
I try ' with the tobacco. I irst, I took 1101006 of
leaf and chened it; but it leing 101:; green
a11dstrong,ulmost stupificd me: next, I stoop.
ed it in some rum an hour or 1110, resolxing
when I 11 en? to bed to take a dose of it . and,
in the third place, I brunt some 01 or a pan of
fire, holding mv nose over it so long as Icould
endure it without suffocation.

In the intervals of this operation, though my
head 11 as giddv and disturbed hr the tobacco,
I took up t 113 Bible to 1ead.No sooner did I
open, but theie appeared to me these words,
" Call on me in the do '13' 01 trouble, and 1 11111
dehver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."

. At first, this sentence made. a very deep im.
pression on my heart: but it soon were 011'

again "hen I considerthc word "deliver" was
foreign to me. And as the children of' Israel
said, when they were promised flesh to eat,
" Can God spread a table in the wilderness?" In
the like manner I began to say, Can God him-
self deliver me from this desolate Island? How.
ever, the words would still return to my mind,
and afterwards made a greater impression upon
me. As it now was 1 ery late, and the tobacco
had dozed my head, Iwas inclined to sleep ,
but before I nould lie down, I tell on my
knees, and implored the promise that God had
made to me in the holy Scriptures, that "if I
called on him in the day of trouble, he would
deliver me." "'ith much difficultyl afterwards
drank the rum, wherein I had steeped the to-
bacco,whieh flying into my head, threw me into
such a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock
the next day before I an olte , or, rather, I be.
lime, I slept No (111315, having certainly lost a
day in my- account, and I could never tell any
other 11 ay. When I got up, my Spirits were
lixely and cheerful; mv stomach much better,
being veiy 1mm , and, in short, no fit return-
ed the next day, nhich was the 29th, but I
found m: self much altered for the better.

July 3. The fit quite left me, but very
weak. In this condition, I often thought of
these words, "I will deliver thee :" and while
at sometimes I would think of the impossibility
of it, other thoughts would reprehend me, for
disregarding the deliverances I had received
even from the most forlorn and distressed con'.

550

dition. I asked myself, what regard have I
had to God for his abundant mercies? Have I
done my part? " He has delivered me, but I
have not glorified him ;" as if I had said, I had
not owned and been thankful for these as de-
liverances, and how could I expect greater?
So much did this sensibly touch my heart, that
I gave God thanks for my recovery from sick-
ness in the most humble posture.

July 4. This morning I began seriously to
ponder on what is written in the New Testa-
ment, resolving to read a chapter every morn.
ing and night, as long as my thoughts would
engage me. As soon as Iset about this work
seriously, I found my heart deeply affected
with the impiety of my past life. After this, I
begged of God to assist me with his holy Spirit
in returning to my duty. One day, in pe-
rusing the Scriptures, I came to these words,
"He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to
give repentance, and to give reniiSSion :" Im- .-
mediately I laid down the book, and, with up. .
lifted hands to heaven, loudly cried, "O bless.
ed Jesus, thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalt-
ed Prince and Saviour, give me repentance :"
And, now indeed, I prayed with a true sense
of my condition, and a more certain hope,
Founded on the word of God. Now I had a
different sense of these words, " Call on me,
and I will deliver time," that is, from the dread-
ful load of guilt, which oppressed my sinful
soul, and not from a solitary life: in a word, I '
came to this conclusion, that a delive'ra'nc from

sin was amuch greater blessing than a deliver-
ance from affliction.

To the 14th of July, I walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been re.
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness.
The applications and experiments I used were
perfectly new : neither could I recommend
them to any one's practice. For though it
carried off the fit, it very much weakened me;
and I had frequently convulsions in my nerves
and limbs for some time. From hence I learn-
ed, that going abroad in rainy weather, espe-
cially when it was attended with storms and
hurricanes {of wind was most pernicious to
health. I had now been above ten months in
the island ; and as I never had seen any of the
human kind, I therefore accounted myself as
sole monarch; and as I grew better, having
secured my habitation to my mind, I resolved
to make a tour round my kingdom, in order to
make new discoveries.

The 15th of July,I began my journey. I
first went to the creek, where I had brought my
rafts on. shore; and travelling farther found
the tide went no higher than two miles up,
where there '35 a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant sa.
vannahs or m adows, smooth, plain and cover-

  
  

ed with gra Q11 the rising parts, where I
supposed th '.'ei"diSS' not reach, I perceived

a great deal . . " accogifiviflg to a very strong
stalk.' 'Severi other plants'flglilgewise found,
the virtue of which. Iti'did' not understand. I52

searched along time for the cassava root, which
I knew the Indians in that climate made their
bread of; but all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not
what they were: likewise I saw several sugar-
canes, but imperfect for want of cultivation.
W'ith these few discoveries, I came back that
night, and slept contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the 16th, going the
same way, but farther than the day before, I
found the country more adorned with woods
and trees. Here Iperceived difl'erent fruits in
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very
rich, spread over the trees. You may imagine
I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very. spara
ingly, lest I should throw myself into a'flux or
fever. The grapes I found .ot'Zexcelleifiuse;
for whenI dried them in the sun, whicli pre.
served them as dried raisins are kept,:they
proved very wholesome and nourishing, and
served me in those seasons when no E'gt-i'apes
were to be had. ' is.
The night drawing on apace, I. ascended
up a tree, and slept very comfggably, though
it was the first time I had slept oht'~degof_;ny ha-
bitation. And when the mornino cat'n'eJ pro.
needed with great pleasure on way, travel.
ling about four miles, as "I i 'ed, by the
length of the valley. At the en' this valley
I came to an Opening, where; the country
seemed to descend to the west; there I found
a Spring of fresh water, proceeding out of the53

side of the hill, with its crystal streams running
directly east. And indeed here my senses
were charmed with the most beautiful land-
scape nature could afi'ord ;. for the country ap-
peared so flourishing, green and delightful,
that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I
then descended on the side of that delicious
vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange,
lemon, and Citron trees, but very wild and
barren at that time. As for the limes, they
were delightful and wholesome, the juice of
which I afterwards used to mix in water, which '
made it very cool and refreshing. And now I
was resolved, to carry home and lay up a store
of grapes, limes and lemons, against the ap.
proaching wet season. So laying them up in
separate parcels, and then taking a few of each
with me, I returned to my little castle, after
having spent three days in this journey. Be.
fore I got home, the grapes were so bruised
that they were utterly spoiled; the limes in:
deed were good, but of those, I could bring -
only a few. -

July 19. Having prepared two bags, I re.
turned thither again, but to my great surpise,
found all the grapes spread about, trod to
pieces, and aWnndance eaten, which made me
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts.
To prevent this happening again, I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them
upon the out branches of the tree, both to
keep them unhurt, and that they might cure

and dry in the sun: and having well loaded
E2

054

myself with limes and lemons, I returned once
more to my old place of residence.

And now, reflecting on the fruitfulness of
this valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
security from storms, and the delightfulness of
the adjacent woods, I concluded I was setled in
'the worst part of the country, and therefore
Was thinking to remove my,>> habitation.

But 1111e11 I considered again, that though
it was pleasant, it was off from the sea sit! e,
where there was a possibility, some time or
other, a ship might either be driven or sail by ,
and that to 1nclosc myself among hills and
woods must certainly put an end to my hopes
of deliverance: I resolved to let my castle re-
main where Pro1idence had first placed it.
Yet so delighted 11 as I 111th this place, thatI
made me a little kind of b011"e1, surrounding it
with a double hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked and filled with bulrushes: and
having spent a great part of the month of July,
I think it 11 as the first of August before I be-
gan to enjoy my labour.

August 3. Percei1ing my grapes to be dry,
Itook them from the t1ees, and they proved
excellent good raisins of the sun. 1' the most ot
which I carried to my cave; and happy for me
I did so, by which I saved the best part of my
winter food.

August 14. This day it began to rain; and
though I had made me a tent like the other,
Vet having no shelter of a hill to keep me from
storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to, I55

was obliged to return to my old castle, the
rain continued more or less every day, till the
middle of October; and sometimes so violently,
that I could not stir out of my cave for severa'.
days. This season I found my family to inn
crease; for one of my cats that had run away
from me, and which I thought had been dead,
returned about August, with three kittens at.
her heels, like herself; from these cats pros -
ceeded such numbers, that I was forced to kill
and destroy them as I would do wild beasrs or
vermin.

To the 26th of this month, I could not stir
out, it raining incessantly; when beginning to
want food, I was compelled to venture twice,
the first of which times I shot a goat, and
afterwards found a very large tortoise. The
manner of regulating my food was thus : a"
bunch of raisins served me for my breakfast; a
piece of goat's flesh or turtle boiled for my
dinner, and two or three turtle eggs for my
supper. While the rain lasted, 1 daily worked
two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and,
by degrees worked it on towards one side of
the hill, and made a door or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall, and so I came
in and out this way. But after I had done this,
I was troubled to see myself thus exposed;
though I could not perceive any thing to fear,
a goat being the biggest creature I had seen
upon this island.

September 30. Casting up the notches on my
post, they amounted to 365, I concluded this56

to be the anniversary of my landing; and there-
fore, humbly prostrating myself on the ground,
confessing my sins, acknowledging God's righ-
teous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus
Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for
twelve hours till the going down of' the sun;
and then eating abiscuit and a bunch of grapes,
laid me on a bed, and with great comfort took
my night's repose. Till this time, I seldom had
distinguished the Sabbath-day ; but now I
made a longer notch than ordinary for the days
of rest, and divided the weeks as well as. I
could, though I found I had lost a day or two
in my account. My ink failing soon alter, I
omitted in my daily memorandum, things of an
indifl'erent nature, and contented myself to
write down Only the most remarkable events of

gany life. The rainy and dry seasons appeared

now regular to me, and experience taught me
how to provide for them; yet in one thing I
am going to relate, my experience very much
failed me. You may call to mind, what I
have mentioned of some barley and rice which
I had saved; about thirty stalks of the former,
and twenty of the latter; and, at that time, the
sun's being in its southern position, going from
me, together with the rains, made me con-
clude it a very proper season to sow it. Ac-
cordingly I dug up a piece of ground, with my
wooden Spade, and dividing it in two parts,
sowed about two--thirds of my seed, preserving
by me a handful of each. And happy it was
I did so; for no rains falling, it was choked- v--w--m--'c.

57

up, and never appeared above tae earth till the
wet season came again, and then part of it
grew, as if it had been newly sown.

I was resolved still to make another trial;
and seeking for a moister piece of ground near
my bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed
in February, which, by having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, yielded a no.
ble crop, and sprung up very pleasantly. I
had still saved part of the seed, not daring to
venture all; and by the time I found out the
proper seasons to sow it in, and that I might
expect every year two seed-times and two bar.
vests, my stock amounted to above half a peek
of each sort of grain.

No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes
which I had cut from the trees, shot out like
willows, the first year after lapping their heads.
I was ignorant of the tree I cut them from; but
they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in
three years time, that I resolved to cut more
of them ; and these soon growmg made a
glorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe.

And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into sum-
mer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet,
and drSSr seasons, as in this manner.

From 5 February 15, g Rainy,szm coming near
To ( April 15, the Equ-inox,2 months.
From 5 April 15, 2 Dry, am getting north
To ( August 15, from the line, 4 months;58

From 3 August 15, Wet, the sun being then
To October 15, come back, 2 months.
From October 15, Dry, sun naming south
To 3 February 15, i of the line 4 months.

The wet seasons would continue longer or
shorter, as the 11 ind continued or ceased to
blow. But having found the ill consequences
.of being abroad 1n the rain, I took care before
hand to furnish my self with provisions: and,
during the wet months, sat within doors as
much as possible. At this time I contrived to
make many handy things that I wanted, though
it met me much labour and pains, before I could
accomplish them. The first I tried was to
make a basket; but all the twigs I could get,
proved so brittle, that I could not then per-
form it. It now proved of great use to me
that when a boy, I took great delight 1n stand-
ing at a basket maker's, in the:3 same town
where my father li1 ed, to view his men at 11ork .
like other 1101 5, being curious to see the manner
of their working these things, and 1ery officious
to assist, I perfectly learned the method of it,
and wahted nothing but the tools. And it
coming into n11 mind, that the twigs of that
tree of which I made my stakes, might be as
tough as a sallow willow, or osiers giowing 111
England, I resolved to make an experiment,
and went the next day to my country seat,
and found some fit for my turn ; and after cut-
ting down a quantity with my hatchet, I dried
them in my pale, and, when fit to work with59

carried them to my cave, where I employed
myself 1n making several sorts of baskets, m-
somuch thatIcould put in whatsoever I pleased. .
It is true, they were not cleverly made, yet," ..
they served my turn upon all occasions. . ,, ._ 73;.

But still I wanted two necessary th' "Lu ' 1%;
had no cask to hold my liquor, exc t 3%,?
almost full of rum, a few bottles of an o - i. :" '
size, and some square case bottles; neither had
I a pot to boil any thing 1n, only a large kettle,
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I
wanted likewise at the beginning of this dry
season a tobacco pipe; but for this DI afterwards
found an expedient.

I kept myself employed in planting my
second row of stakes. But remembering that
when I travelled up to the brook I had a mind
to see the whole island, I now resumed my in-
tention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two
biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a
laiger quantity of powder and shot than usual,
I began my journey. Having passed the vale
where my bower stood, I came within view of
the sea lying to the west; whenhit being a
clear day, I fairly descriod land, extending
from the west to the south-west about 10 or 15
leagues, as I concluded; but could not say
whether it was an island or acontinent. Neither
could I tell what this place might be; only
thought it was part of America, and where I
might have been in a miserable condition had
I landed. Again I considered, that if this was00

l.)l]( . qpan .ish coast, certainly, one time or the
other, I shooid see some ships pass by; and if
it was not, then it must be the savage coast,
between the Spanish country and Brazil, which
abounds with cannibalsor man-eaters.

As I proceeded forward, I found this side of
the island much more pleasant than mine ; the
fieldgfragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and
verdant grass, together with several very fine
woods. Theri were parrots in plenty which
made me long for one to be my companion;
but it was with great difficulty I could knock
one down with my stick; and I kept him at
home some years , before I could get him to call

e by name.

mIn the low grounds I found various sorts of
hares and forces as I tool: them to be, but much
difibrent from those in England. Several of
these I killed, but never ate them; neither in.
deed had I am occasion; for ni oundinrr with
'roats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes I could defy
any market to furnish me a better table. II]
this journey I did not travel above two miles a
day, because I tool: several turns and wind-
ings, to see what discoveries I could make, re.
mining 1i ea. \ enough to the plaCe "here I de-
signed to rest all nicrht, which was either in a
tree, or to a placea which I surrounded with
stakes, that no wild creature might suddenly
surprise me. When I came to the seashore,
I was amazed to see the splendour of it. Its
strand was covered with shells of the most61

oeautiful fish, and constantly abounding with
innumerable turtles, and fowls of many kinds,
which I was ignorant of, except those called
penguins. I might have shot as many as I
pleased, but was sparing of my ammtmition,
rather choosing to kill a she-goat, which I did
with much difficulty, on account of the flatness
of the country.

Now, though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction, yet my habitation was so
much to my liking, that I did not repine at my
being seated on the worst part of the island.
I continued my journey, travelling about twelve
miles further towards the east, where I set a
great pile on the shore for a mark, concluding
that my next journey should bring me to the
other side of the island, east from my castle,
and so round till I came to my post again.
As I had a constant View of the country, I
thought I could not miss my way ; but scarce.
had I travelled three miles, when I descended
into a very large valley, so surrounded with
hills covered with wood, that having no guide
but the sun, and to add to my misfortune, the
weather proving very hazy, I was obliged to
return to my post by the seaside, and so back-o
wards the same way I came. In this journey
my dog surprised a kid, and would have killed
it, had I not prevented him. As I had often
been thinking of getting a kid or two, and so
raising a breed of tame goats to supply me
after my ammunition was spent, I took this
opportunity of beginnincr: and, havingimade

a collar for this little creature, with a string
made of rope-yarn, I brought it to my bower,
and there inclosed and let": him; and having
spent a month in this journey, at length I
returned to my old habitation.

Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when
I returned to my little castle, and reposed my
self in mv hammock. After my journcv I
tested 1n}sc-'.f a 11 eeh 11 Inch time I empIO) ed
in multintr a cage tor n1) prett} poll. Inow
began toa recollect the poor ltidI had left in
the hon CI, and i111medilutel) 11 out to fetch it
home. II hen I came tl 1016, I found the young
creature almost sta11';ed I gaie it some food,
and tied it as befme, ' but tl1e1e 11.13 no ocea-
sion, for it followed me like a dog; and as I
constantly fed it, it became so loving, gentle,
and fond, that it commenced one of my do-
mestics, and would never leave me. "

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of September
in the most solemn manner, as usual, it being
the thiid Year ofm} abode in the island. ISpent
the 11 hole day 111 aeknouled<ring God's mercies,
in gixing thanl: s [in makinira this solitary lite as
agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human
society; and for the communication of his
grace to my soul, in suppmting, comfmting,
:nd encouraging me to depend upon his I'iovi.
dence, and hope {'01 his ete1nalp1esence in the
world to come.

Indeed, I often did consider how much more
happy I was, in this state of life, than in that63

accursed manner of living I formerly used;
sometimes. however, when hunting, or viewmg
the country, the anguish of my soul would
break out upon me, and my very heart would
sink within me, to think of the woods, the
mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I
was a prisoner locked up within the eternal
bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited
wilderness, without hopes, and without redemp-
tion. In this condition,I would often wring
my hands, and weep like a child: and even
sometimes in the middle of my work, this fit
would often take me; and then I would sit
down and sigh, looking on the ground for an
hour or two together, till such time as my grief-
got vent in a flood of tears.

One morning, as I was fullyemployed in this
manner I opened my bible, when immediately
I fixed my eyes upon these words "I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee '" Surely, '1'
if God does not forsake me, what matte1s it, '
since he can make me more happy 1n this state
of life, that if I enjoyed the greatest splendour
in the world? And whenever I opened or shut
the Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that
diieeted myg oood friend in England to send it
among my goods without my order, and for as.
sisting me to save it from the power of the
raging ocean.

And now beginning my third year, my se-
veral daily employments were these: First,
My duty to Heaven, and diligently reading the
Holy Scriptures which I did twice or thrice64

everv (1113'; Secondly, Seeking provisions with

and fatigue in such a piece of work; but thisI
went through with patience, as also many other
things, that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do.

The harvest months, November and Decem
her, were new at hand, in which I had the
pleasing prospect of a very good crop. v1o;65

here I met with a new misfortune, for the goats
and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of
the blade, kept it so short that it had no
strength to shoot up into a stalk. To prevent
this, I enclosed it with a hedge, and by day
shot some of its devourers, and my dog, which
I had tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all
night, so frightened these creatures that I got
entirely rid of them.

But, no sooner did I get rid of these, than
other enemies appeared; to wit, whole flocks
of several sorts of birds, who only waited ti.
my back. was turned, to ruin me. So much did
this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three
of the malefactors; and afterward served them
as they do notorious thieves in England, hung
them up in chains as a terror to others. And,
indeed, so good an effect had this, that they
not only forsook the corn, but all that part of
the island, so long as those criminals hung
there. .

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end
of December, which was my second harvest, I
reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my
broad swords. I had no fatigue in cutting
down my first crop, it was so slender. The ears
I carried home in a basket, rubbing the grain
out with my hands, instead of threshing it;
and, when my harvest was over, found my half.
peck of seed had produced nearly two bushels
of rice, and two bushels and a half of barley.
And now I plainly foresaw, that, by God's
~goodness,I should be furnished with bread

1' 266

but yet I was concerned, because I knew not
how to grind or make meal of my corn, neither
knew I how to bake it into bread. I would
not, however, taste any of the crop, but resolv-
ed to preserve it against next season, and, in
the mean while, use my best endeavours to
provide myself with other food.

But where were my labours to end? the want
of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to
dig it, I conquered by making me a wooden
spade. The want of a harrow I supplied, by
dragging mm the com a great bough of a tree.
11111535 it 11 as growing, I was forced to fence
it, 11 hen ripe, to me" it, ca1ry it home, thresh
it, part it from the chat}, and sate it. And,
after all, I \1 anted a mill to grind it, a sie\e
to d1ess it, yeast and salt to make it into
bread, and an men to bake it. This set my
brains to work, to find some expedient for
ex 01v one of these necessaries, against the next
hanest.

And now having more seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
large flat pieces of ground, near my castle, for
that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, and
fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up
three months: by which time, the wet season
coming 011, and the rain keeping me within
doors. I t'onnd several occasions to employ
myself; and, while at work, used to divert my-
self with talking to my parrot, teaching him to
know and Speak his own name Poll, the first
welcome word I ever heard spoken in the island.67

Ihad been a long time contriving, how to make
earthen vessels, which I Vt anted extremely;
and "lien I considered the heat of the climate,
Idid not doubt but, if I could find any such
clay, I might botch up a pot, strong enough,
when dried in the sun, to bear handling, and to
hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal,
and other things.

To be short, the clay I found; but it would
occasion the most serious person to smile, to
see what awkward w a_\s I took, and what ugly
misshapen things Imade; how many either fell
out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun,
and fell in pieces when, they were removed, so
that I think it was two months before I could
perfect any thing; and even then but two
clumsyt thihgs in imitation of earthen jars.
These, howei er, I v ery gently placed in wicker
baskets, made on purpose for them, and be.
tween the pot and the baskets, smiled it full of
rice and barley straw; and these I presumed
would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the
meal, when the corn was bruised. As for the
smaller things,I made them with better suc-
cess; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
_p'itc hers, and pipkins, the sun baking them very
hard.

Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely neces-
sary, and that was an earthen pot, not only to
hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It once happened that
as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a
broken piece of one of my vessels, burnt hard68

as a rock, and red as a tile. This made me
think of burning some pots; and having no
notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead,
I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots in a pile one upon another. The fire I
piled round the outside, and dry wOod on the
top, till I saw the pots in the inside redhot, and
found that they did not crack at all: and when
I perceived them perfectly red, I let them stand
in the fire about five or six hours, till the clay
melted by the extremity of the heat, and would
have run to glass had I suffered it; upon which,
I slacked my fire by degrees, till the redness
abated; and watching them till the morning, I
found I had three very good pipkins, and two
earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn
as I could desire.

The first use to which I turned my pipkins,
was to make some salt, which I had long wantq .......
ed. For this purpose, I filled them with sea-
water, and kept it slowly boiling over the
fire, till the whole of the water had boiled
away in steam, leaving, at the bottom of the
vessel, a thin crust of salt, which I found very
good for giving a relish. to my food.

The next concern I had, was to get me a
stone-mortar to beat some corn in, instead of a
mill to grind it. Here, indeed, I was at a great
loss, as not being fit for a stone-cutter; and
many days I Spent to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar,
and strong enough to bear the weight of a

pestle, that would break the corn without filling69

it with sand. But all the stones of the island
being of a monldering nature, rendered my
search fruitless; and then I resolved to look
out a great block of hard wood ; which having
found, 1 formed it by my axe and hammer, and
then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it,
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes.
When I had finished this, I made a great pestle
of iron-wood, and then laid them up against my
succeeding harvest.

My next business was to make me a sieve,
to sift my meal and part it from the bran and
husk. Having no fine thin canvas to search
the meal through, I could not tell What to do.
What linen I had was reduced to rags ; I had
goat's hair enough, but neither tools to work it,
nor did I know how to spin it. At length, I
gmembered I had some neclacloths of calic;
or muslin of the"'s'aj'l'ors;"'which-I---I+ad
out of the ship, and with these, I made three
small sieves proper enough for the work.

I come now to consider the baking part.
The want of an oven I supplied, by making
some earthen pans very broad, but not deep.
When I had a mind to bake, I made a great
fire upon my hearth, the tiles of which I had
made myself, and when the wood was burnt
into live coals, I spread them over it, till it be-
came very hot; then sweeping them away, I
set down my loaves, and whelming down the
earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and
coals all around the outsides of the pets to con-
tinue the heat; and in this manner I baked my7t)

barley leaves, as well as if I had been a com.
plete pastry cook, and also made of the rice,
several cakes and puddings.

It is no wonder that all these things took me
up the best part of a year, since what inter-
mediate time Ihad, was bestowed in managing
my new harvest and husbandry; for in the
proper season, I reaped my corn, carried it
home, and laid it up in the ear, in my large
baskets, till I had time to rub, instead of
threshing it. And now indeed, my corn in-
e1easecl so much, that it p1educed me twenty
bushels of barley, and as much of rice, that I
not onl1 began to Use 'it fr'eel}, but was think-
ing how to enlarge my barns, and resolved to
sow as much at a time as would be sufficient
for a whole year.

All this while, the prosPeot of land, which I
had seen from the other side of the island, ran
in my mind. I still meditated a deliverance
trom this place, though the tear of greater mis.
loitunes might l1a1e deteued me from it. For,
alle11 111'1 that I had attained that place,I ran
the hazaid of being killed and eaten by the
devouring eannibals; and if they were not so,
yet 1 might be slain, as other Europeans had
been, who fell into their hands. Notwith-
standing all this, my thoughts ran continuallyi
Lipon that shore. I new 111shed for the long
beat with the shoulder of mutton sail. I went
to the ship' s boat, that had been cast a great
11': 1}? on the shore 1n the late storm. She was
1. .. '1-113l but alittle;11111l l1.1 bottom being71

tinned up b} the impetuositv and shrge of the
urn es and wind, I fell to work with all the
strength I had, and VVith levers and rollers I
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair
the damages she had sustained. This work
took me up three or four VVeeks. when finding
my little strength all in vain, I fell to under.
mining it by digging away the sand, and so to
make z"it fall d0VV',n Osctting pieces of VV-ood to
thiust and guide it in the afall. But after this
VVas done, I VV as still unable to stir it up, or to
get under it, much less to move it forwards
awards the VV ater, and so I was forced to give
it 0V er. .

This disappointment. 110VV eV er, did not fright.
on me. I beg: 11 to think, VVhether it VV as not
possible for me to make a canoe or Perigua,
such as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree.
But here I lay under particular inconveniences;
Want of tools to make it, and want of hands to
more it into the water when it was made. How.
ever, to work I went upon it, stopping all the
enquiries Icould make with this very simple
answer I made to myself, let's first make it,
I'll VVamrnt I'll find some way or other to get
it along VV hen it is done.

I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five
feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next
the stump, and four feet elm en inches diameter
at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. TVVenty davs was I hacking and
haVV'ing it at the bottom, fourteen more in

I;
f72

'edfling oil the branches and limbs, and a
11 hole month in shaping it like the bottom of
a boat. As tor the inside, I wa as three weeks
with a mallet and chissel, clearing it in such a
manner, as that it was big enough to carry 26
men, much bigger than any canoe I ever saw
in my life, and consequently sufficient to trans.
port me and all my eti'eets to that wished for
shore I so ardently desired.

Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the
greatest difficulty, to get it into the water, it
lying about 100 yards from it. To remedy the
first inconvenience, which was a rising hill be.
tween the boat and the creek, with wonderful
pains and labour I dug into the surface of the
earth, and made a declivity. But when this
was done, all the strength I had was as in-
sufficient to more it, as it was when I first
made the attempt. I then proceeded to mea.
sure the distance of ground, resolving to make
a canal, in order to bring the water to the ca~
noe, since I could not bring the canoe to the
water. But as this seemed to be impracticable
to m} self alone under the space of eleven or
twelve 1ca1s, it brought me into some sort of
consideration, so that I concluded this also to
be impossible, and the attempt vain. I now
saw, and not before, what stupidity it is to
begin 11 orlt be -fore we reckon its costs, or
judge rightly our own abilities to go through
11 ith its pei t01 manor).

In the height of this work my fourth year ex-
plied hem the time I 11213 cast on this island.

--.--__- 'w- __..____ __--~------_----_--.__--.___--_____73

At this time I 'did not forget my anniversary;
but kept it with rather greater devotion than

before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I

looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing
to do with; and very well might I say, as fa-
ther Abraham said unto Dives, " Between me,
and thee there is a gulph fixed. " And indeed
I was separated from its wickedness too, hav.
ing neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye, nor the pride of life; I had nothing to
covet, being lord, king and emperor over the
whole country I had in possession, without
dispute and without controul: I had loadings
of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance,
and grapes above measure. What was all the
rest to me? the money I had, lay by me as
deepicable dross, which I would freely have
given for a gross of tobacco pipes or a hand.
mill to grind my corn: in' a word, the nature
and experience of these things dictated to me
this just reflection. That the good things of
this world are no further good to us, than as
they are for our use; and that whatever we
may heap up, we can but enjoy as much as we
use, and no more.

'1 hese thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I
did eat with thankfulness, admiring the provi-
dential hand of God, who, in this wilderness
had spread a table to me. And now I con-
sidered what I enjoy,ed rather than what I
\1',anted compared my present condition with
"hat I at first expected it should be; how I

e'74

should have done, if I hill] got nothing out of
the ship , that I must have perished before I
had caught fish or turtles , or lir ed, had I
found them, like a mere savage, by eating them
raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws, j
like a beast. Inext compared my station to
that which I dcserv ed; how undutiful I had
been to my parents , how destitute of the fear
of God; how void of every thing that u as
good; and how ungrateful tor those abundant
merciesI had received from heaven, being fed,
as it "ere, by a miracle, even as great as
Elijali's being fed by ravens; and cast on a
place W'heie them are no \enomous creatmes
to poison or devour me , in short, making God's

tender mercies matter of great consolation, I
relinquished all sadness, and gave way to con.
tentment.

As long as my ink continued, which with u a. .
16:: I made last as long as I could. I used to
an: m: c . own the days of the month on which .
anv rm..- rkable thing happened. .

Tia:- :xt thing that wasted after my ink, was 3,.
the DlaCUlt, which I had brOUght out oi'the ship; :15:
and though I, allowed myself but one cake a :55;
day for about a twelvemonth, yet I was quite 3
out of bread for nearly a year, before I got any '7
corn of my own.

In the next place, my clothes began to de- '1
my, and my linen had been gone long befoze.
However, I had preserx- ed abort three dosen
ofthe sailor's chequered shirts s "lllCh pun ed a
great refreshment in me v. lit: 1: the Violent

beams of the sun would not 8113': me "
any of the seamen '3 heavy watch coats; w
made me turn tailor, and, after .a niiSer hie, '-
botching manner, convert them to jackets. o ~
preserve my head, I made a cap of goatskins,
with the hair outwards to keep out the rain;
which indeed served me so well, that after.
ward I made a waistcoat and open-kneed
breeches of the same: and then I contrived
a sort of umbrella, covering it with skins,
which not only kept out the heat of the sun, but
the rain also. Thus being easy and settled in
my mind, my chief happiness was to converse
with God, in most heavenly and comfortable
ejaculations.

For five years after this, I cannot say any
extraordinary thing occurred to me. My chief
employment was to cure my raisins, and plant

barley ana rice, of both which I had a
year's provision before hand. But though I
was disappointed in my first canoe, I made it,
at intermediate times, my business to make a
second of much inferior size : and it was two
years before I had finished it. But as I per.
eeived it would in no wise answer my design
of sailing to the other shore, my thoughts were
confined to take a tour round the island, to see
what further discoveries I could make. To
this intent, after having moved her to the wa-
ter, and tried how she bwould sail, I fitted up a
little mast to my boat, and made a sail of the
ship's ssails that lay by me. I then made lock-
ers or boxes at the end of it to put in noses.76

saries, provision and ammunition, which would
preserve them dry either from the rain, or the
spray of the sea; and, in the inside of the
boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay my
gun, and to keep it dry, made a cover for
it. My umbrella, I fixed in a step in the
stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the sun
off me. And now resolving to see the circum-
ference of my little kingdom, I victualled my
ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of
my barley bread loaves, an earthen pot full of
parched rice, :1 little bottle of rum, half a.
goat, powder and shot, and two watch-coats.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth
year of my reign, or captivity, that I set out in
this voyage; which was much longer-'than I
expected, being obliged to put farther out, by
reason of the rocks that lay a great way in the
sea. ' ' g

And indeed, so much did these rocks sur-
prise me, that I was for putting back, fearing
that if I ventured farther, it would be out of my
power to return : in this uncertainty I came to
anchor just off the shore, to which I waded
with my gun on my shoulder, and then climb-
ing Up a hill, which overulooked that point, I
saw the full extent of it, and so resolved to run
all hazards.

In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a
violent current running to the east, coming
very close to the point; which I the more
carefully observed, thinking it dangerous, and
that when I came to it, I might be driven into'77

the sea by its force, and not able to return to the
island: and CCI'IflJulY it must have been so,
had I not made this observation; for on the
other side was like the current, with this dif-
ference, that it set off at a greater distance ;
and I perceived there was a strong eddy under
the land; so that my chief business was to
work out of the first current, and conveniently
get into the eddy. Two days I staid here,
the wind blowing very briskly east south east,
which being contrary to the current, leaves a
great breach of the sea upon the point; so it
was neither fit for me to keep too near the
shore, on account of the breach; nor stand at
too great distance for fear of the streams.
That night the wind abating, it giew so calm,
that I ventured out: and here I may be a
, ument to all rash and ignorant pilots; for
We no sooner come to the point, and not,
above the boat's length flom shore, but I was
got into a deep water, with a current like a
mill-race, which drove my boat along so vio-
lently, that it was impossible for me to keep
near the edge of it, for it forced me more and
more out from the eddy to the left of me; and
all I could do with my paddles was useless,
there being no wind to help me.

Now I began to look upon myself as quite
lost, since, as the current ran on both sides of
the island, Iwas veiy certain they must join
again, and then I had no hopes but of perish.

ing for want, in the sea, after what provision
c 278

I had' was spent, or before, if a storm should
happen to arise.

w IVho can conceive the present anguish of
my- mind at this calamity? with longing eyes
did I look upon my little kingdom, and thought
the island the pleasantcst place in the uni.
verse. Happy, thrice happy desert, said I,
shall I never see thee more '2 'Wretched crea.
ture! wither am I going? Why did I mur.
mur at my lonesome condition, when now I
would give the whole world to be thither
again? IVhile I was thus complaining, I
found myself to be driven about two leagues
into the sea: however, I laboured till my
strength was far spent, to keep my boat as far
north as possibly I could, to that side of the
current where the eddy lay. About noon
I perceived a little breeze of wind, Springap
from the south south east, which overjoyed my
heart: and I was still more elated, when, in
about half an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale.
Had any thick weather sprung up, I had been
lost another way: for having no compass on
board, I should never have found the way to
steer towards the island, if once it had disap-
peared; but it proving the contrary, I set up
my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away
northward, as much as I could, to get rid of
the current. And no sooner did the boat be.
gin to stretch away, but I perceived, by the
clearness of the water, a change of the current
was near; for, where it was strong, the water79

was foul; and where it was clear, the current
abated.

Those who have been in the like calamities
with my own, may guess my present excess of
joy, how heartily I ran my boat in the stream
of this eddy, and how joyfully I spread my sail
to the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully be
fore it, with a smart tide under foot. By the
assistance of this eddy, I was carried above a.
league home again, when, being in the wake
of the island, tbbetwizrt the two currents, I
found the water to be in a sort of a stand.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached
within a league of the island, and perceived
the points of the rock, which caused this dis
aster, stretching out, as I observed before, to
the southward, which throwing oil the cur.
rent more southerly, had occasioned another
eddy to the north. But having a fair brisk
gale, Istretched across this eddy, and in an'
hour, came within a. mile of the shore, where I
soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and
after an humble prostration, thanking God for
my deliverance, with a resolution to lay all
thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my boat
safe gto a little cove, and laid me down to take
a welcome repose. When I awoke, I was con.
sidering how I might get my boat home; and
coasting along the shore I came to a good bay,
which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where,
finding a l1arbour_.I stowed her as safe as
if Shea had been in a dry dock, made on pur-
pose for her.80

I now perceived myself not far from the
piace, where before I had travelled on foot; so
.aking nothing with me, except my gun and
umbrella, I bcegan my Journey, andb in the
evening came to my bower, where I again laid
me down to wet. I had not slept long before
1 aVValtened in great surprise, by a strange
voice that called me several times, "Robin,
Jtobin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin? Where
are you, Robinson Cruso'! Where are you?
'Where have you been 'l"

So fast was I asleep, that at first I did not
awake thoroughly; but half asleep, and half
awake, I thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me. But as the voice repeated
"Robinson Crusoe," several times, being ter-
ribly frightened, I started up in the utmost con-
fusion; oand, no sooner were my eyes fully
open, but I beheld my pretty poll sitting onthe
op of the hed<re, and soon knew lathat it
was he that called me; for just in such be-
wailing language, I used to talk and teach
him; which he so exactly learned, that he
would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill
close to my face, and cry, _" poor Robinson
Crusoe, where are you? where have you been?
how came you here?" and such like prattle I
had constanth taught him. But even though
I knew it to be the: panot it was a great time
befo1e I could adjust myself: being amazed
how the creature got thither, and, that he
should fix about that place, and no where else.
But now, being assured it could be 1111 other~.--.y>>;u--r--\w~n-a.. <<0.45". . . \- 2', u .-

than my honest " Poll," my wonder ceased,
and reaching out my hand, and calling "Poll,"
the creature came to me familiarly, and perch.
ed upon my thumb, as he was wont, constantly
prating to me with "poor Robinson Crusoe,
and how did I come here, and where had I
been i" as if the bird was overjoyed to see me,
and so I took him home along with me. I was
now pretty well cured of rambling to sea; yet
I could wish my boat, which had cost me So
much trouble and pains, on this, side the island
once more, but this, indeed, was impracticable.
Itherefore began to lead a very retired life,

living nearly a twelvemonth in a very content-

ed manner, wanting for nothing but conversa-

S tion. As to mechanic labours, which my ne-

cessities obliged me to, I fancied I could, upon
occasion, make a tolerable carpenter, were the
poor tools I had to work withal, but good.
Besides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I
contrived to make them with a wheel, which I
found much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which befbre was rude and ugly. But, I

. think I was never so elevated with my own per.

formance or project as when able to make a to.
bacco-pipe, wihch, though it proved an awkward
clumsy thing, yet it was very sound, and carried
the smoke perfectly well, to my great satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, made me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though
not very handsome, were very handy and con.
venient to fetch things home in, as also for hold.
ing my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions8

My powder beginning to fail, made me ex
amine after what manner I should kill the
goats or biids, to live on, alter it 11 as all gone.
Upon which, I contrived many ways to ensnare
the goats, and see if I could catch them alive,
particularly a she-goat with V-oung.

At last I had my desire; for, making pit.
falls and naps, baited with barley and rice, I
found, one morning, in one of them, an old he
goat, and in the other, three kids, one ,male
and two females.

So boisterous was the old one, that I could
not bring him an a). But I forgot the old pro-
verb," That hunger will tame a lion: " tor,
had I kept him three 01 fou1 daVs VVithout
prOVisions, and then giV en him some VVatc1,
Vet'sith a little corn, he VVould haVe been as tame

ayoung kid. The othe1 creatures I bound .'
with strings together; but I had great diffi-
culty before I could bring them to my habi. ,
tation. It was some time before they would F
feed; but, throwing them sweet corn, it so
much tempted them, that they began to be
tamer. From hence I concluded, that if I
designed to furnish myselt with goat's flesh,
when my ammunition was spent, the tamely ,,
breeding them up, like a flock of sheep, about "
my settlement, was the only method I could
take. I concluded also I must separate the
wild from the tame, or else they would alVV aVs
tun VV 11d as they grew up , and the best way
for this, was to have some inclosed piece of
ground, well fenced, either with a hedge or

pale, to keep them so effectually, that those with-
in might not break out, nor those without break
in. Such an undertaking was very great for
one pair of hands; but as them was an absolute

necessity for doing it, my first care was to find

a convenient piece of ground, where there was
likely to he herbage for them to eat, water to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
Here again, I gave another instance of my
ignorance and inexperience, pitching upon a
piece of meadow land so large, that had I
enclosed it, the hedge or pale must have been
at least two miles about. This thought came
into my head, after I had carried it on, I be.
lieve, about fifty yards: I therefore altered
my scheme, and resolved to enclose a piece of
ground about 150 yards in length, and 100 in
breadth, large enough for as many as would
maintain me, till such time as my flock in.
creased, and then I could add more gro J.nd
Inow vigorously prosecuted my work, and it
took me rDabout thiee months in hedging the
first piece; in which time I tethered the three .
kids in the best part of it; feeding them as
near me as possible, to make them familiar:
and, indeed, I re ry often would carry some
ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand , by 'which they grew so
tame, that when my enclosure was finished,
and I had let them loose, they would run after
me for a handful of corn. This indeed an.
swered my end . and in a year and a half's
time, I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids84

and all; and in two years after, they amounted
to fortydhree, besides what I had taken and
killed for my sustenance.

After which, I inclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them
into, that I might take them asI had occasion.

In this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of goat's
flesh, but milk too, which in the beginning, I
did not so much as think of. And, indeed,
though I had never milked a cow, much less a
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after
some essays and miscarriages, I made me both,
and never afterward wanted.

How mercifully can the Almighty comfort
his creatures, even in the midst of their greatest
calamities? How can he sweeten the bitterest
evils, and give us reason to magnify him in
dungeons and prisons; what a bounteous table
was here spread in a wilderness for me, where I
expected nothing at first, but to perish for hun ger.

Certainly any one would have smiled to see
me at dinner. There sat my royal majesty, an
absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, at-
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom if I pleas.
ed, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give
them liberty, or take it away. When I dined,
I seemed a king, eating alone, none daring to
presume to do so till I had done. Poll, as if
he had been my principal court favourite, was
the only person permitted to talk with me. My
old but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly
crazy, continually sat on my right hand; whilev,"-

85

f my two cats sat on each side of the table, ex-

pecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark
of my royal favour. These were not the cats
Ihad brought from the ship; they had been
dead long before, and interred near my habita.
tion by mine own hand. But a couple of their
young I had made tame; the rest ran wild into
the woods, and 1n time grew so impudent, as to
return and plunder me of my stores, till such
time as I shot a great many, and the rest left
me without troubling me any more. In this
plentiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing
but conversation. One thing indeed concern-
ed me, the want of my boat; Iknew not which

way to get her round the island. One time I
" resolved to go along the shore by land to her;
: but had any one at home met such a figure, it

would either have afl'righted him, or made him
burst into laughter, nay, I could not but smile
myself at my habit, which I think m this place
will be very proper to describe.

The cap I wore upon my head, was great,
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin, with -
a flap or pentchouse hanging down behind, not
only to keep the sun from me, but to shoot the
rain off from running into my neck, nothing be.
ing more pernicious than the rain falling upon
the flesh in these climates. I had a short jacket
of goat's skin, whose hair hung down such a-
length on each side, that it reached down to
the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stock.
in gs, I had none, but made a resemblance of
something, I knew not what to call them; they

if86

were made like buskins, and laced on the sides
like. spatterdashes, barbarously shaped, like the
rest of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's
skin dried, gi1t round me with a couple of
thongs, instead of buckles , on each of which,
to supply the deficiency of sword and daggar,
hung my hatchet and saw. I had another Bbelt,
not so broad, yet fastened 1n the same manner,
11hich hung over my shoulder, and at the end
of it, under my left aim, hung two pouches,
made of goat's skin, to hold my powder and
shot. My basket I carried on my back, and
my <<run on my shoulder , and over my head a

great clumsy ugly goats skin umbrella, 11h1ch
l1o11 e1 e1, next to my gun, was the most neces.
sar3 thing about me. - As for my face, the
colour was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, or
as might have been expected from one who took
so little care of' it, in a climate within nine or
ten degrees ofthe line. At one time, my beard
grew so long that it hung down above a quar-
te1 of a 3ard; but as I chad both razors and
scissms in store, I cut it all off, and suffered
none to tr1011' except a large pair ofMahometan
whiskels, the like of which I had seen 11 orn by
some. Turks at Salee, not long enough indeed
to hang a hat upon, but of such a monstrous
size, as would have amazed any in England to
have seen.

But all this was of no consequence here,
the1e being none to obsen e my behaviour or
habit. And so, 11ithout lean and without con.
1101, I proceeded on m3 journey, the riroseeu-87

tion of which tool: me up five or six days. I
travelled along the sea shore, directly to the
place where I first brought my boat to an an.
chor, to get upon the rocks; but now having
no boat to take care of, I went, over-land, a
nearer way to the same height that I was be.
fore upon ; when looking forward to the point;
of the rock, which lay out, and which I was
forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to
see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no
rippling motion, nor current, any more than in
other places. And now I was convinced that
by observing the ebb and flow of the tide, I
might easily bring my boat round the island
again. But when I began to think of putting
it in practice, the remembrance of the late
danger struck me with such horror, that I took
another resolution, though more laborious; and
this was to' make a second canoe, and so have
one for one side of the island, and one for the
other.

I. had now two plantations in the island '; the
first my little fortification, fort, or castle, with
many large and spacious improvements. for
by this time, I had enlarged the cave behind me
with several little caves, one within another, to
hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles
with which I made my wall were grown so
lofty and great as obscured my habitation
And near this commodious and pleasant settle
ment, lay my well cultivated and improved corn
fields, which kindly yielded me their fruit in the
proper season. My second plantation was that88

near my country seat, or little bower. where
my grapes flourished, and where, having plant-
ed my stakes, I made inclosures for my goats,
so strongly fortified by labour and time, that it
was much stronger than a wall, and, conse-
quently, impossible for them to break through.
As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in
repair, and cut the trees in such a manner, as
made them grow wild, and form a most delight-
ful shade.~ In the centre of this, stood my tent,
thus erected. I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece of the ship's
sail, beneath which,I made me a sort of couch
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and
other things; and having laid thereon one of the
sailor's blankets, which I had saved from the
wreck of the ship, and covering myselt' with a
great watch coat, I took up this place for my
country retreat.

Very frequently, from this settlement did I
use to visit my boat, and keep herin very good
order. And sometimes would I venture in her
a cast or two from shore, but no farther. But
now, I entreat your attention, whilst I proceed
to inform you of a new, but most surprising
scene of life which here befel me.

You may easily suppose, that, after having
been here so long, nothing could be more

amazing than to see a human creature. One
day it happened, that going to my boat, I saw
the print of a man's naked foot on the shore,
very evident on the sand, as the toes, heels,
and every part of it. Ilad i seen a monster 0!' ROBINSON on rsom , .,

the most frightful shape, I could not have been
more confounded. My willing ears gave the
strictest. attention. I cast. my eyes around, but
could satisfy neither the one nor the other, I
proceeded alternately to every part of the shore,
but with equal effect; neither could I see any
other mark though the sand about it was as
susceptible to take impression, as that which
was so plainly stamped. Thus struck with
confusion and horror, I returned to my habita.
tiou, frightened at every bush and tree, taking
eveiy thing for men; and possessed with the
wildest ideas! That night my eyes never
closed. I formed nothing but the most dismal
imaginations. In a word, all my religious
hopes vanished, as though I thought God would
not no"r protect me by his power, who had
wondeil'ully preserved me so long.

What Vaiious chains of events are there in
the life of man. 7 How changeable are our afi'ec-
tinns, according to different circumstances '1
We love to dav, what we hate tmmorrow. deg we
shun one hour, what we seek the next. This
was evident in me in the most conspicuous
manner: for I, who before had so much 13.-
mented my condition, in being banished from
all humamkind, was now ready to expire,
when I consulei ed that a man had set his foot
on this desolate island. But 11 hen I consider.
ed mV station of life, decreed by the infinitely
v. ise and good providence of God, that I ought
not to dispute my Creator's s01 ereignty, who
had an undoubted right to gm em and dispose

11 290

of his creatures as he thinks convenient; and
that his justice and mercy could either punish
or deliver me, I say, when I considered all
this, I comfortably found itm my duty to trust
sincerely in him, pm} ardently to him, and
humbly resign myself to his divine will.

One morning ,lying on my bed, these words
of the sacredp w ritings came into my mind,
" Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon
this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my
bed, I offered up my prayers in the most
devout manner : and when I had done, taking
up my Bible to read, these words appeared
first in my sight , " Wait on the Lord, and be
of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart:
Wait, I say, on the Lord.' Such divine com-
fort did this give me, as to remove all cause of
sadness upon that occasion.

Thus, after a w orld of apprehensions and
fears, for three days and nitrhts, I at last ven-
tured out ofmy castle, and milked myg o-oats, one
of which was almost spoiled for want bof' it. I
next, (though in great fe:1r,) visited my bower,
and milked my flocks there also; when, growing
bolder,I went down to the shore again, and
measuring the print of the foot to mine, to see
perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark,I found it much superiorin largeness;
and so returned home, absolutely convinced.
that either some men had been ashore, or that
the island must be inhabited; and therefore that
I might be surprised before I was aware.91

I now began to think of providing for my se.
curity, and resolved in my mind many different
schemes {For that purpose. I first proposed to
cut down my inclosures, and turn my tame
cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy
might not find them, and frequent the island in
hopes of killing the same. Secondly, Iwas for
digging up my corn-fields for the very same
reason. And, lastly, I concluded to demolish
my bower, lest, seeing a place of human con.
trivance, they might come farther, and find out .
and attack me in my castle.

Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that
night; yet nature, spent and tired, submitted
to a silent repose the next morning, and then
joining reason with fear, I considered, that
this delightful and pleasant island might not be
so entirely forsaken as I might think; but that
the inhabitants from the other shore might sail,
either with design, or from necessity, by cross
winds; and, if the latter circumstance,l had
reason to believe, they would depart the first
Opportunity. However, my fear made me
think of a place of retreat upon an attack.
I now repented that I had made my door to
come out beyond my fortification; to remedy
which, I resolved to make me a second one: I
fell to work, therefore, and drove betwixt that.
double row of trees, which I planted above
twelve years before, several strong piles, thick-
ening it with pieces of timber and old cables,
and strengthening the foot of it with earth
which I dug out of my cave ; I also made me92

other 111121115. To preserve my stock of tame

the island, 11111ch 11-113 the place where I had

secured in it, and I put therein two hegoats,
and ten she ones.

All this labour was occasioned purely by
fearful apprehensions, on account of seeing the
print of a man's foot. And not contented yet
With what I had done, I searched for another
place towards the west part of the island, where
I might also retain another flock. Then wan-
dering on this errand more to the west of the
island than ever I had yet done, and casting my
eyes towards the sea, methought I perceived a.
boat at a great distance; but could not possibly
tell what it was for want of my spy-glass. I
considered then, it was no strange thing to see
the print of a man's foot; and concluding them
cannibals, blessed God for being cast on the
other side of the island, where none of the
savages, as I thought, ever came. But when
I came down the hill to the shore, which was the
south.west point of the island, I was soon con-
firmed in my opinion ; nor can any one describe
my horror and amazement, when I saw the
ground spread with sculls, hands, feet, and
bones of human bodies ; and particularly, I
perceived a space like a circle, in the midst of
which had been a fire, about which I conjec-
tured those wretches sat, and unnaturally sacri-
ficed and devoured their fellow creatures.

The horror and loathsomeness of this dread.
ful Spectacle, both confounded my senses, and
made me discharge from my stomach in an ex.
cessive manner. Ithen returned towards my94

habitation; and in my way thither shedding
floods of tears, and falling down on my bended
knees, gave God thanks for making my nature
contrary to those wretches, and delivering me
so long out of their hands.

Though reason and my long residence here
had assured me, that the savages never came,-
up to the thick woody part of the country, '
and that I_had no reason to be apprehensive of
a discovery, yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that for two years after, I confined
myself only to my three plantations; I mean
my castle, country seat, and inclosure in the
woods, though in process of time, my dreadful
apprehensions began to wear away.

Thus my circumstances for some time re-
mained very calm and undisturbed: though in.
deed, the terror which the savages had put me
in, spoiled some inventions for my own conve-
niences. One of my projects was to brew me
some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when
it is considered, that I had neither casks suf-
ficient, nor could I make any to preserve it in;
neither had I hops to make it keep, yeast to
make it work,.nor a copper or kettle to make
it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after some years,I
might bring this to bear, as I had done other -
things. But now my inventions were placed
another way : and day and night I could think
of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these cannibals, when, proceeding to their
bloody entertainments; and so saving a victimw
from being sacrificed, that he might afier be.
come my servant. Many were my contri-
vances for this purpose, and many more objec-
tions occurred, after I had hatched them. I
once contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their fire and put therein five
or six pounds of gunpowder, which would con.
sequently blow up all those that were near it;
but then I was loth to spend so much upon
them, lest it should not do that certain execu-
tion I desired, and only'afl'right and not kill
them. Hating laid this design aside, I again
proposed to my bself' to lie privately in ambush
in some convenient place, with my three guns
double loaded, and let fly at them in the midst
of thetr dreadful ceremony; and having killed
two or three of them at every shot, fall upon
the rest suddenly with my three pistols, and let
not one mother's son escape. This imagina-
tion pleased my fancy so much that I used to
dream of it in the night time. To put my de-
sign in execution I was not long seeking for a
place convenient for my purpose, where unseen
I might behold every action of the savages.
Her e UI placed my two muskets, each of which
was loaded with a brace of slugs, and four or
five smaller bullets about the size of pistol bul.
lets; the fowling piece was charged with near-
ly a handful of the largest swan shot, and in
every pistol about four bullets. And thus all-
things being prepared, no sooner did the we].
come light sp1 ead ox er the element, but I would
issue forth from my castle, and fi'om a lofty96

hill, three miles distant, try if I could see any
invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom.
But having waited in vain two or three months,
it grew very tiresome to me.

I now argued with myself, it was better for
me never to attack, but to remain undiscovered
as long as I possibly could; that an opposite
conduct would certainly prove destructive ;
for as it was scarcely to be supposed I could
kill them all, I might be either overpowered by
the remainder, or that some escaping might
bring thousands to my certain destruction.
And, indeed, religion took their part so much as
to convince me how contrary it was to my duty,
to be guilty of shedding human blood, innocent
blood, innocent as to me in particular, whatever
they are to one another; that I had nothing to
do with it, but leave it to the God of all power
and dominion, as I said before, to do therein
what seemed convenient to his heavenly vvis.
dom. And, therefore, on my knees I thanked
the Almighty for delivering me from bloody

,guiltiness, and begged his protection that I
might never fall into their hands.

Thus giving over an attempt which I had
rashly begun,I never ascended the hill on that
occasion afterward ; I only removed my boat,
which lay on the other side of the island, and
every thing that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there might not
be the least shadow of any boat near, or habi.
tation upon the island. My castle then be.
came my cell,keeping always retired in it, ex.97

cept when I went out to milk my she-goats, or
my little flock in the wood, which was quite out
of danger : for sure I was, that these savages
never came here with expectation to find any
thing, and consequently never wandered from
the coast; however, as they might have seve.
ral times been on shore, as well before as
afier my dreadful apprehensions, I looked
back with horror to think in what state I might '
have been, had I suddenly met them, slenderly
armed, with one gun only loaded with small
shot; and how great would have been my
amazement, if, instead of seeing the print of
one man's foot, I had perceived fifteen or
twenty savages, who, having once set their
eyes upon me, by the swiftness of their feet,
would have left me no possibility of escaping?
These thoughts would sink my very soul, so
that I would fail into a deep melancholy, tili
such time as the consideretion of my gratitude
to the divine Being moved it from my heart.
I then fell into a contemplation of the secret
springs of Providence; and how wonderfully
we are delivered, when insensible of it; and
when in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt
or hesitation, what secret hint directs us, in the
right way when we intended to go out of it,-
my perhaps contrary to our business, sense, or
inclination. ,
Anxieties of mind, and the care of my pre-
servation, put a period to all future inventions
and contrivances, either for accommodation, or
convenience, I now cared not to drive a nail,
z9S

chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke
discover me. And on this account I used to

burn my earthen ware privately in a cave,
which I found 111 the 1v,ood and which I made

com enient for that purpose; the principal
cause that brought me here was to make- char.

began to think, that (.11 on this might be wary -99

brought hither two fowling pieces and three,"
muskets, leaving only five pieces at my castle,

planted in the nature of cannon. In a barrel
of gun-powder, which I took out of the sea, I

brought away about sixty pounds of good pow.

der, which was not damaged ; and this, with a
great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed
from my castle to this retreat, now fortified
both by art and nature.

_ I fancied myself now like one of the giants
'of old, who were said to live in caves and holes
among the rocks, inaccessible to any but them-
selves, or, at least, most dangerous to attempt.

And now I defied both the cunning and
strength of the savages, either to find me out
or to hurt me.

I think I was now in the twenty third year
of my reign, and my thoughts much easier
than formerly, having contrived several pretty
amusements, and diversions to pass away the
time in a pleasant manner. By this time my
pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and
pronounce his words very articulately and,
plain ; so that for many hours we used to chat
together after a very familiar manner, and he
lived no less than twenty-six years. My dog
which was nineteen years old, sixteen of which
he lived with me, died some time ago, of mere
old age. As for my cats, they multiplied so
fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into
the woods, except two or three which became100

my particular favourites. Besides these, I
continually kept two or three household kids
about me, which I taught to feed out of my
hand, and two more parrots which could talk
indifl'erently, and call Robinson Crusoe, but
not so excellently as the first, by my not taking
so much pains with them. I had also several
sea-fowls which I had wounded and cut their
wings; and growing tame they used to
breed among the low trees about my castle.
walls, all of which made my abode very agree-
able.

But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoy ments of this uncertain state of life,
when we least expect them! It was now the
month of December, and the particular time in
my ha1vest, which required my attendance in
the fields ; when going out pretty early in the
morning, before it was day-light, there appear.
<<ed to me from the sea-shore, a flaming light,
:1lJOlIt two miles from me at the east end ofthe
sland, where I had observed some savages
had been before, not on the other side, but to
my great aflliction it was on my side of the
island.

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
my improvements,I returned directly to my
castle, pulled the ladder after me, making all
things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place,I put myself in a
posture ot defence, loaded my muskets and

pistols, and committing myselt to God's pro-101

'tection, I resolved to defend myself till my
last breath. Two hours after, impatient for
intelligence, I set my ladder up to the side of
the hill, where there was a flat place, and then
pulling the ladder after me, ascending to the
top, where laying myself on my belly, with my
perspective glass Iperceived no less than nine
naked savages, sitting round a small fire, eat-
ing as I supposed, human-flesh, with their two
canoes hauled on shore, Waiting for the flood
to carry them off again. The consternation I
was in at this sight, especially seeing them
near me, was very great; but when I perceived
their coming must be always with the current
of the ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts,
being fully convinced, that I might go abroad
with security all the time of flood, if they were
not before landed. And, indeed, this proved
just as I imagined ; for no sooner did-they all
take boat and paddle away, but the tide made
north-west. \Vhen I saw them gone, I took
two guns upon my shudders, and placing a
couple of pistols in m ' belt, with my great
sword hanging by my side, 1 went to the hill,
where at first I made a (I scovery of these can.
nibals, and then saw there had been three ca-
noes more of the savages on shore at that place,
which with the rest, were making over to the
main land.

But nothing could he more horrid to me,
when going to the place of sacrifice, the blood, a
the bones, and other mangled parts of human
bodies appeared in my sight ; and so fired was

I 2 '102 - '

I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to
be revenged on the first that came there, though
I lost my life in the execution. It then appear. .
ed to me, that the visits which they make to _.
this island are not very frequent, it being fifteen ,
months before they came again: but still Iwas '
very uneasy, by reason of the dismal appre.
hensions of their surprising me unawares; nor '
dared I offer to fire a gun on that side of the Q
island where they used to appear, lest, taking
the alarm, they might return with many hun.
dred canoes, and then God only knows in what
manner I should have made my end. Thus was i
I a year or more before I saw any of these de. .'
vouring cannibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident, '
which demands attention, for a while, eluded
the force of my thoughts in revenging myself
on those heathens. j
On the 16th of May (according to my '
wooden calender) the wind blew exceedingly "
hard, accompanied with abundance of thunder -
and lightning all day, and succeeded by a very
stormy night. The seeming anger of the
heavens made me have recourse to my Bible.
Whilst I was seriously pondering upon it, I >>
was suddenly alarmed with the noise of a gun,
which I conjectured was fired upon the ocean.
Such an unusual surprise made me start up in g
a minute; when, with my ladder, ascending-the
mountain as before, that Very moment a flash
of fire presaged the report of another gun,
which I presently heard, and found it was from103

- the part of the sea where the current drove me
; away, I could not but then think, that this must
be a ship in distress, and that these were the
melancholy signals for a speedy deliverance.
Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon this occa-
sion; but my labours to assist them must have
proved altogether vain and fruitless. How-
ever, I brought together all the dry wood that
was at hand, and making a pretty large pile.
set it on fire on the hill I was certain they
plainly perceived it, by their firing another
gun as soon as it began to blaze, and after that
several more from the same quarter. All night
long I kept up my fire , and when the air
cleared up, I perceived something a great way
at sea, directly east, but could not distinguish
what it was, even with my glass, the weather
being so very foggy out at sea. However,
keeping my eyes directly fixed upon it, and
perceiving it. did not stir, I presently concluded
it must be a ship at anchor, and so very hasty
was I to be satisfied, that, taking my gun, I
went to the southwest part of the island, to the
same rocks where I had been formerly driven
array by the current; in which time, the wee.
their being perfectly cleared up, to my great
sorrow, I perceived the wreck of a ship cast
away upon those hidden rocks I had pfound
when I was out with my boat; and which, by
making a kind of an eddy, were the occasion of

my preservation.
When I conside ed seriously eveiy thing
concerning this wreck, and could per. eive 11910-1

room to suppose any of them saved, I cannot
explain, by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often
breaking out in this manner. Oh! that there
had been but two or three, nay, even one per.
son saved, that we might hate lived together,
com ersed with, and comforted one anothei!
and so much 11 ere my desires moved, that
when I repeated these V1 ords, " oh i that there
had been but one!" my hands would so clench
together, and my fingers press the palms of' my .
hands so close, that, had any soft thing been
between, they would have crushed it, while my
teeth would strike together, and set against
each other so strong, that it required some
time for me to part them.

Till the last year of my being on this island,
] net er lznew vhether or not any had beeri
saved out of this ship. I had the affliction,
some time after, to see the corpse of a drowned
boy come on shore, at the end of the island
which was next the shipwreck; there was no-
thing on him but a seam-an's waistcoat, a pair
'ot' opemkneed linen drawers, and a blue linen
shirt, but no particular mark to guess \1 hat
nation he 11 as of. In his pocket were two
pieces of eight, and a tobacco pipe, the last
of which 1 preferred much more than I did the
first. And now the calmness of the sea tempt.
ed me to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to get something necessary out of the
ship, but perhaps, some living creature might
be. on board, whose lif' e I might preserve. This105

had such an influence upon my mind, that im-

_ mediately I went home, and prepared every

thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on

'- board my boat, provisions of all sorts, with a
: good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a com-

pass: so putting off, I paddled the canoe along
the shore, till I came to the north-east part of
the island, from whence I was to launch into

- the ocean; but here the current ran so violently, -

and appeared so terrible, that my heart began
to fail me; forcseeing, that if Iwas driven into
any of these currents, I might be carried not
only out of the reach or sight at the island, but
even inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the
ocean.

So oppressed was I at these troubles, that It.
gave over my enterprize, sailing to a little
creek on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat
me down on a rising hill, very pensive and
thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was
turned, and the flood come on, which made it
impracticable for me to go out for so many
hours.

That night, I reposed myself in my canoe,
coveted with my watch coat instead of a 'olan.
ket, the heat ens being my- tester. I set out with
the first at the tide Dfull north, till I felt the
benefit of the cutrent, which carried me ata
great rate eastward, yet not with such impe.
tuosity as before, as to take from me all
government of my canoe: so that in two hours
I came up to the w rock, which appeared to me

amost melancholy sight. It seemed to be a106

Spanish vessel by its building, stuck fast be.
tween two rocks; her stern and quarters beaten
to pieces by the sea ; her maimmast and fore.
mast were brought ofl' by the board; that IS,
broken short ofl'. As I approached nearer,I
perceived a dog on board, who seeing me
coming ,yelped and :ried . hnd no sooner did
1 call him, but the poor creature jumped into
the sea, out. of which I took him up almost
furnished with hunger and thirst : so that when
I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf
could devour it more greedily; and he drank
to that degree of fresh water, that he would
have burst himself had I suffered him.

The first sight I met with in the ship, were
two men drowned in the cock-room, or fore-
castle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence
I very probably supposed, that 11 hen the Vessel
struck 1n the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break 1n and 01 er her, that the men
not being able to bear i-,t were strangled by the
constant{9 rushing of the 11 me There 11 ere
several easks of liquar, whether wine or brandy
I could not be positive, 11inch la;- in the lower
hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing
out of the water, yet were too large for me to
pretend to meddle with : iikewise I perceived
several chests, which I supposed belonged to
the seamen, two of which I got into my heat,
without examining what was in them. What
became of the rest of the sailors I could not
certainlv tell; and all hot riches signified n0-
thing at that till ie to 2111' Lee "'107

Searching fa1ther, I found acask, containing
about twenty gallons full of liquor, which with
some labour I got into my boat , in the cabin
SS1vere several musk ets, whichI let remain there;
_ut took a11ay with me a great powder horn,
inith about four pounds of powder in it. I
0011 also a fire shovel and tongs, with two
3' rass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate,
.11 nd a grid-iron ; all which were extremely ne.
essary to me, eSpecially the fire- shovel and
_- ongs. And so with this cargo, accompanied
; y my dog, I came away, the tide serving for
I: 111: 1t purpose; and the same evening ,about an

'1

hour within night, I attained the island, after
itl1egreatest toil and fatigue imaginable.

' That night I reposed my weaiy limbs 1n the
boat, resolving the next morning to harbour
.1. Mint I had gotten, in my new found under-
{.7 ground grotto , and not carry my cargo home
' to my ancient castle. Having refreshed my.
1 self, and got all my effects on shore, I next pro.
ceeded to examine the particulars; and so
.= tapping the cask, I found the liquor to be a
kind of rum, but not like what we had at the
Brazils, nor indeed near so good. At the
.1 opening of the chest, several things appeared
, very useful to me; for instance, I found in one,
' a very fine case of bottles, containing the finest
- and best sort of cordial 11 aters, each bottle
held about three pints, euiious'n tipt with sil1er.
1 lound also 1110 pots full of the choicest sweeu
' meats, and two moie which the water had utter-

ly spoiled. There were likewise several good

shirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and. about
one dozen and a half of white linen handker.
chiefs, and coloured neckcloths, the former of
which were absolutely necessary for wiping my
face in a. hot day; and in the till, I found three
bags of money, in one of wh1ch decently wrapt
up in a piece of paper, were six doubloons of
gold, and some small bars and wedges of the
same metal, which I believe might weigh near
a pound. In the other chest, I only found some
clothes of very little value, and about two
pounds of fine glazed powder, 1n three flasks,
kept as I believe, for charging their fowlin
pieces on any occasion, so that, on the wholeI
made very little of this voyage. The money
was indeed as mere dirt to me, useless and un- .
profitable, all which I would have freely parted
with, for two or three pair of English shoes and
stockings, things that for many years I had not
worn, except those which I had lately taken of?
the feet of the unfortunate men I found drown.
ed in the wreck, yet not so good as English
shoes either for ease or service. I found no
gold in the second chest; so concluded that
11- but I took from the first belonged to an officer,
the latter appearing to hate :1 much inferior
peison for its owner. However, as deSpicable
as the money seemed, I- likewise lagged it to
my cave, laying it up securely, as I did the rest
ofm} cargo, and intending to seek out, and re
turn it to the family of the unfortunate owner,
if e'; or I should return to Emope- -: and, afterl
had done all this, I returned back to my boat'i

rowmg or paddling her along till I came to my
old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and
so made the best of my way to my castle.
When I arrived there, every thing seemed safe
and quiet ; so that now, my only business was .
to repose myself after my wonted manner, and
take care of my domestic affairs. But though
Imight have lived very easy, as wanting for
nothing absolutely needful ; yet still I was
more vigilant than usual, upon account of the
savages, never going much abroad; or, if I did,
it was to the east part of theisland, where I was
well assured that the savages never came, and
where I might not be troubled to carry such a
heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I was
obliged to do if I went the other way.

Two years did I live in this anxious condi-
tion, in all which time, contrary to my former
resolutions, my head was filled with nothing but
projects and designs how I might escape from
this island ; and so much were my wandering
thoughts bent upon a rambling disposition, that
hadI had the same boat that I went from Salee
in,I should have ventured once more, to the
uncertainty of the raging ocean.

Having retired to my castle, after my late
voyage to the ship, my frigate laid up and
secured, as usual, and my condition the same
as before, except being richer, though I had as
little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru
had for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came
among them: one night in March, being the
rainy season, in the four and twentieth year of

K110

my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very well in
health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon
uneasiness either of body or mind; yet not,
withstandi11g,l could not compose mvself to
sleep all then night long. All this tedious while,
it is impossible to express what innumerable
thoughts came into my head. I traced quite
over, the whole history of my life in miniature,
from my utmost remembrance of things til! I
came to this island; and then proceeded to ex-
amine every action and passage that had occur-
red since Iliad taken possession of 1m kingdom.
In my leflections upon the latte1; I 11 as com-
paring the happ} posture ol n1} afiai1s in the
beginning of my reign, to this life of anxiety,
fear, and concern, since I had discovered the
print ol'a foot in the sand; that while I continu'
ed without apprehension, I was incapable of
feeling the dread and terror I now suffered.
How thankful 1atl1e1 ought I to haxe seen for
the knonledge of m} danger, since the. greatest
happiness a man can he possessed of is to 111116
sufficient time to provide against it? How 5111.
pendous is the goodnes ss of Providence, which
sets Such narrow bounds to the sight and know.

serene and calm, b1 hm 1110' cathe e1 ent>> of things
hid from their. exes ,and knowing nothing of
those many dangers that SUH'OUIld them, till
perhaps they are dissipated and vanished away

About a year and half after, one morning
early, I was very much surprised by seeing n0111

less than five canoes all on shore together, on
my side ofthe island, and the savages that he-
longed togthem all landed,'and out of my sight.
Upon which, much dispirited and perplexed, I
'sy still in my castle; which, l1owever,I put
m a proper posture for an attack ; and, having
formerly provided all that was necessary, was
soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should
they attempt it. Having waited for some time,
my impatient temper would let me bear it no
longer; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and, as usual, ascended up, to the top of the
hill at two stages, standing, howe ever, in such a
manner, that my head did not appear above the
hill, so that they could not easily perceive me .
and here, bv the assistance of mv perspective
glz1~s,I observed no less than thirty in number
mound a fire, feasting upon 11 hat meat they had
dressed: how thev cooked it, or what it was, I
could not the n perfectly tell; but they were all
dancing and capering about the flames, using
many tiirrhttul and barbarous gestures.

But wiiile, with a curious eve, I was behold-
ing these wretches, my spirits sunk within me,
when I perceivedthem drag two miserable crea-
tures from the boats, to act afresh the dread-
ful tragedv, as I supposed the),r had done be-
fore. z"It was not long before one of them fell
upon the ground, knocked down as I suppose,
with a club or wooden sword, for that was their
manner; while two or three others went imme-
diately to work, cutting him Open for their
cookery . and then fail to devour him as they1173

had done the former: while the last unhappy
Captive was left by himself, till such time as
they were read3 for him. The poor creature
looked round him with a sorrowful eye, trem-
bling at the thoughts of death; 3et, seeing
himself'a little at liberty, nature, that very mo.
ment, as it. were, inspired him with hopes of
life: He started away from them, and ran,
with incredible swiftness, along the sands, di.
rcctly to that part of the coast where my on-
cient and venerable castle stood.

You may well imagine, I was dreadfully af'.
frighted upon this occasion, when as I thought,
they pursued him in a whole body, all running
to" ards my palace. And now, indeed, I ex.
pected,tl12it he 11ould certainl3 ii} to 11 3 grove
for protection. Houever, my Spirits begiiining
to reem e1 I still kept upon myignard and I
new plainly percei1 ed, there were' but three
men out ot the number that pursued him. I
was infinitely pleased at the swiftuess with
which the poor creature ran from his pnrsuers,
gaining so much .gronnd upon them, that I
plainly pert: ei1 ed, could he thus hold it out for
h'11fa11 hour, there we 3 not the least doubt but
he nonld sa1e his life from the power of his
enemies.

fietween them and my castle, there was a

meek, the very same 11hieh I sailed into with
all my effects trom the wreck of ihe ship, on
the steep banks of 11hich,I 1er3' much feared
the poor 1ictim would be ta 1611, if he could
not snim for his escape . but soon was I out of113

pain for him, when I perceived he made no.
thing of it, though at full tide, but, with an
intrepid courage, spurred on by the sense of
dangerfiie plunged into the flood, swimming
over in about thirty strokes, and then landing,
ran with the same incredible strength and
swiftness as before. \Vhen the three pursuers
came to the creek, two of them, who I per.
ceived could not swim, happily for themselves,
returned to their company, while the other,
with an equal courage but much less swii'tness,
attained the other side, as though he was re-
solved never to give over the pursuit. And
now or never, I thought, was the time for me to
procure me a servant, companion, or assistant
and that I was decreed by Providence to be the
instrument to save this poor creature's life.
immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my two
guns, which, I said before, 'were at the bottom
of them : and, getting up again with the same
haste towards the hill, I made nearer the sea.
In a word, taking a short cut down the bill, I
interposed between the pursuer and pursued,
hallooing aloud to the latter, who, venturing .7
'to look back, was, no doubt, as much terrified-j}
at me as at the enemy from whom he fled. I '-
beckoned to him, with my hand, to return back,
and, in the mean time, advanced towards the
pursuer. I was very unwilling to fire lest the
rest should hear, though, at that distance, I
questioned whether they could or no; and being

out'of-sight of the smoke, they could not easily
K 2114

have knownwhat to make of it. The savage
stopped as if he had been amazed; when, ad-
vancing towards him, I could perceivefiim take
his bow from his back, and, after fixi c an ar-
row to it, preparing to shoot at me, and, with.
out dispute, he might have lodged it in my
breast; but in this absolutely necessary case of
self-preservation, I immediately fired, and shot
him dead, just as his hand was going to draw
the fatal string. All this while, the savage,whe
had fled before, stood still, and had the satis-
faction to see his enemy killed, as he thought,
who designed to take away his life; so afi'right.
ed was he with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood as it were like Let's wife, fixed
and immoveable without either sense or motion.
This obliged me to halloo to him again, making
the plainest signs I could to him to draw near.
er. I perceived he understood these tokens, by
his approaching to me a little way, when, as if
afraid I should kill him too, he stopped again.
Several times did he advance, and as often stop
in this manner, till, coming more to my view,
I perceived him trembling, as if he was to un-
dergo the same fate. Upon which, I looked
upon him with a smiling countenance, and still
beckoning to him; at length he came close to
me, and kneeled down, kissed the ground, laid
' his head upon it, and taking me by the foot,set

wards, was a token of swearing to be my 'sla'V'e
for ever. I took him up, and makingmuch of
him, encouraged him in the best mannerI could.115

The greatest astonishment that my new ser.
vant conceived, was at the manner of killing
the savage at such a distance, without a bow
and arrfi: and such was his longing desire to
know it, that he first pointed to the dead car.

leave to go to it. Upon which I bid him go,
and, as well as I could, made him sensible I
granted his request. But when he came there,
how wonderfully was he struck with amaze.

another, wondering he could perceive no quan-

tity of blood, he bleeding inwardly: and after.
sufficiently admiring the wound the bullet had-

made in the breast, he took Up his bow and
arrows, and came back again; upon which, I
turned to go away, making signs to him to fol-
low, lest the rest missing their companion,
might come in pursuit of him, and this I found
he understood very well, by making me to un-
derstand that his design was to bury it, that
it might not be seen; and which by signs again
I made him sensible I very much approved of.
Immediately he fell to work, and never was
grave-digger more dexterous in the world than
he was; for in an instant, as I might say, he
scraped a large hole in the sands with his
hands, sufficient to bury it in; there he drag.
ged it, and, without any ceremony, covered it
_ .over. I then called him away, and instead of

carrying him directly to my castle at first, I
conveyed him to my cave on the farther part
of thesisland.

Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, un.
doubtedly must this poor creature be, SUpport.
ed chiefly by the vivacity of spirfi and 1111.
common transports of Joy that his liverance
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and water to drink, on
which he fed tery cheerfully, to his exceeding
refreshment. I then made him a convenient
bed, with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket
upon it, (a bed which I used myself sometimes)
and then pointing to it, made signs for him to
lie down to sleep, upon which the poor crea-
ture went to take a welcome repose.

Indeed he was a very comely, handsome,
young fellow, extremely well made, with
straight long limbs, not too large, but tail and
well shaped, and, as near as I could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His counte-
nance had nothing in it fierce or surly, but
rather a sort of majesty in his face; and espe-
cially when he smiled, he had all the sweet-
ness of a European. His hair was not curled
like w,ool as many of the blacks are, but long
and black, with the most beautiful, yet care-
less, tresses spreading over his shoulders.--
He had a very high and large forehead, with a
great v. 'vacity and sparkling sharpness in his
eyes. His skin was not so tawny as that of
the Americans , but rather of a light dun olive
colour, that had something agreeable in it,
though not vely easy to give a :,description of.
His face was round and 23plump, with a small
nose, very different from the flatness of the. human!" '1; -.

and caused him to soak it likewise, to whic'
he readily consented, making signs of ll;
greatest satisfaction imaginable. _
All that night did I keep him there; but 1. 'i

ordered him to arise and come along with 111-.
with certain tokens that I would give him see; '

apprehensions of it, beckoning with my ililll. ?
to come away, which he did with the greater ;
reverence and submission. After this, I con-
ducted him to the top of the hill, to view if the
rest of the savages were yet remaining there:
but when I looked through my perspective
glass, I could see no appearance of them, no
at their canoes; so that it was very evident
they never minded their deceased companiof119

whom we had slain; which if they had, they
would surely have searched for or left one boat
behind for him to follow, after he returned
item his pursuit.

place of theii blood) entertainment. But when
I (tune tlie1e,I 11213 struck with the utmost
horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday
was no way concerned about it, being no doubt
1:1 his turn, one of these devourers. Here lay
several human bones, there several pieces of
111a11gled tiesh, halt eaten, mangled and scorch-
ed, whilst streams 01 blood ran promiscuously

as 11.1ter 111011 a fountain. 1.5 I was musing.

on this dieadtul s: rrht, l tida} took all the pains
he could by [)alllCUlitl signs, to make me un-
derstand that they had brought over four pri-
soners to feast upon, three of whom they had
eaten 11p, and that he was the fourth, pointing
to himself: that there having been a bloody
battle between then) and his great king, in the
just defiance of whom .he was taken prisoner,
111111 man} 01 .1crs; 111 of these were carried off
to different places to be devoured by their con-
querors, ' and that it was his fortune to be
brought hither by these wretches for the very
same purpose. =
After I was made sensible of these things, I
Caused Friday to gather those horrid remains,
and lay them together upon a heap, which I

cidered to be set on the, and burnt. them to
ashes; my man, however, still retained the na-
ture oi a cannibal, ha1ing a hankering stomach
after some of the flesh: but such an extreme
abhorrence did I express at the least appear-
ance of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for
I made him very sensible, that if he attempted
an_-' such thing, I would certainly shoot him.

Tl is being done, I carried my man with me
to n} castl 111, and <<rave him a pair of linen

gunner's chest before mentioned; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well; in
the next place, I made him a jerkin of Goat

cations, in Joe inside of the 11st, and the out~
sid e of the first; and as ll:0lEUR 11 is an" enhance
01 door into 1111 cave, I made '11 101 mal framed
door. .case, and a door to open on the inside: I

barred it up in the night.tin1e,tal1ing in my121

ladders too, so that, was my man to prove
treacherous, there could be no way to Come at
me in the inside of my innermost wall, without
making so much noise in getting over, that it
must needs waken me , for my first wall had
now a complete roof over it of long poles,
spreading over my tent, and leaning up to the
side of the mountain, which was again laid
across with smaller sticks instead of laths, and
thatched over to a great thickness with the rice
straw, which was as strong as reeds; and at the
hole of the place, left on purpose to go in or
out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of a
trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on
the outside, would not have opened at all, but
have fallen down, and made a great noise; and
as to my weapons, every night I took them all
to my bed-side.

But there was no occasion for this precau-
tion; for surely never Master had a more sin.
cere, faithful and loving servant than Friday
proved to me. Without passion, sullenness,
or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his
affections were as much tied to me as those of
a child to his parents; and I might venture to
say, he would have sacrificed his life for the
saving of mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
And, indeed, the many testimonies he gave me
of this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no
occasion to use all these precautions.

I had not been above two or three days re.
turned to my castle, but my chief design was,

n122

how I should bring Friday of? from his horrid
way of feeding; and, to take from him that in.
human relish he by habit had been accustomed
to, I thought it my duty to let him taste other
flesh, which might the rather tempt him to the
same abhorrence I so often expressed against
their accursed way of living. Upon which,
one morning, I took him out :'with me, with an
intention to: kill a kid out of the flock, and
bring it home, and dress it. As I was going,
I perceived a she goat hing down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. Imme-
diately I catched hold of my man F riday, and
bidding him stand still, and not stir, 1 pre.
sented my piece, and shot one of the kids.
My poor servant, who had at a distance per-
ceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not
know by what means, or how it was done,
stood tiembling and surprised, and looked so
amazed, that I3 thought he would have sunk
into the earth. Heb did not see the kid I
aimed at, or behold I had killed it, but ripped
up his waistcoat to see if he Was not wounded,
thinking In} resolution was to kill him; for
coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly
pronouncing many things which I did not
understand the meaning of; which at length I
perceived was, that I \l ould nottake away his alife.

Indeed, so much compassion had I for this
creature, that it was it 1th difiicultv I retrained
from tears. But, however, as another sort of
countenance was necessary, and to convinceI23

him that I would do him no harm, I took him,
smiling, by the hand, then laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had slain, made
signs to him to fetch it, which accordingly he
did. No less curious was he in viewing how
the creature was killed, than he was before in
beholding the Indian; which, while he was ad.
miring, 1 charged my gun again, and presently
perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching
'upon a tree within shot; and, therefore, to let
Friday Understand what I was going to do, I
called him to me again, pointing at the fowl,
which I found to be a parrot. I made him un.
derstand that I would shoot and kill that bird;
accordingly I fired, and bade him look, when
immediately he saw the parrot fall down.
Again he stood like one amazed, notwithstand-
ing all I had said to him: and the more con-
founded he was, because he did not perceive
me put any thing in my gun. As for it in
particular, he would not so much as touch it
for several days after; but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk to
it, as if the senseless piece had understood
and answered him; all this I could percei've
him to do, when he thought my back was
turned, the chief intent of which was, to desire
it not to kill him, as I afterward came to un-
derstand.

I never strove to prevent his admiration,
nor hinder him from these comical gestures he
used on such occasions; but when his asto.
nishment was a little over, I made tokens to124

him to run and fetcn the parrot that I had
shot; which accordingly he did,s staging some
time longer than usual, bv 1eason that the bin]
not being quite dead, had fluttered some way
farther from the place where she fell. In the
mean time, as he was looking for her, I took
the advantage of charging myb <<run again, that
so I might be ready for any other mark that
ofl'ered; but nothing more occurred at the
time. So I brought home the kid, and the
same evening took off the skin, and divided
the carcass as well as I could. Part of the
flesh I stewed and boiled in a pot I had for
this purpose. And then, spreading my table,
I sat down, giving my man some of it to eat,
who was wonderfully pleased, and seemed to
like it very well : but what was the most sur-
prising to him was to see me eat salt with it:
upon which he made me understand, that the
salt was very bad for me; when putting a little
into his mouth, he seemed to nanseate it in
such a manner, as to spit and sputter at it,
and then washed his mouth with fresh water:
but to show him how contrary his opinion was
to mine, I put some meat into my mouth with-
out salt, and feigned to Spit and sputter as
much for "ant ot it, as he had done at it;
yet all this prox ed of no signification to Fri-
day; and it was a long while before he could
endure any salt in his meat or broth, and even
then but a small quantity.

Thus, having fed him sufficiently with boiled
meat and broth at that time, the next dav I

"a
.125

1>> as resolved to feast him with a roasted piece
of the kid. And having no Spit to tasten it,
nor jack to tu1n it, I made use of that common
artifice 11 Inch many of the peeple of England
i1a1 c, that 1s, to set two poles upon each side
at the tire, and one across on the top, hang
in" the meat thezeon 11ith a string, and so
mining it round continually, till it 11.13 sufii-
cicntl1 toasted. This practice caused great
admiration in my man Friday, being quite
another way than that to which the savages
were accustomed. But when he came to taste
the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he
cXpt'ess-ed his entire satisfaction above a thou-
sand different 1111115. As I could not but 1111-
13 11st: 111d his 111ea11ing,10u may be sure I was
as 11or1tloilu'ly pleased, especially 11hen he
11.11.1311 it also 101) plain to me, that he 11ould
newt, while he liv ed, eat man's flesh 1110. 6.

It "as 11. w high time I should set my new
son-:1 at to 111,111; so next day, I put him to
beat out some corn, and sift it in the same
manner as I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the exe.
cution of any thing I ordered him to go about.
I made him understand that it was to make
bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him
see me bake it. In short, he did every thin
as I ordered him in a little time as well as
could perform it myself.

But now, considering that I had two months

to feed instead of one, it was necessary that I
L2126

snould provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I
commonly used to do; upon which, I marked
out a larger piece of land, fencing it in the
same manner as I had done before; in the
execution of which, I must give Friday this
.good word, that no man could work more
hardy, or with better will than he did; and
when I made him sensible that it was for bread
to serve him as well as me, he then very pas-
sionately made me understand, that he thought
I had much more labour on his account than I
had for myself; and that no pains or diligence
should be wanting in him, if I would but direct
him in those works wherein he might pro-
ceed.

I must certainly own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island; for
after some time, Friday began to talk pretty
well, and understood the names of those things
which I was wont to call for, and the places
where I used to send him. So that my long
silent tongue, which had been so many years
unused, except when praying to God, or con.
versing with my poll, now began to be occu.
pied in teaching, and talking to my man Fri.
day; for indeed I had such a singular satisfac.
tion in the fellow himself, so innocent did his
simple and unfeigned honesty appear more and
more every day, that I really began entirely
to love him; and, for his part, I believe there
was no love lost, and that his nature had been127

more charmed by my exceeding kindness, and
his affection more placed upon me, than upon
any other object whatsoever among his owfi
countrymen.

Ionce had a great desire to try if he had
any hankering inclination to his own country
again . and by this time having taught him
English so well, that he could give me tolerable
answers to any question which I demanded, I
asked him whether that nation to which he be
longed ever conquered in battle? This que's.
tion made Friday smile, and to which he
answered," Yes, yes, we always fight the bet.
ter;" as much to say, they always got the bet-
ter in fight. You say, said I, that \ou always
fight the better; why then, Friday, how came
you to be taken prisoner?

Friday. But for all that, my nation beat
much.

.Master. HOW, say you, beat! if your na-
tion beat then, how came you to be taken ?

Friday. The more many mans than my na.
tion, in the place where me was, they take one,
two, three, and me; my nation much overbeat
them 1n the yonder place where me no was,
there at tion mans beat one, two, three great
thousatil'.'

flIaster. Then why did not your men re
coveryou from the hands of your enemies?

Friday. They run one, two, or three, and
me; they make all go into the cnnoe; my'naa
tion have no canoe that time.12S

"aster. 'Tis very well, Fiiday ; but what
does your nation do with the prisoners they
take '2 Do they carry them away and eat them

as they have done?

Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too,
eat up all.

flIaszer. To what place do they cart} t' tent
to be devoured?

Friday. Go to other nations where they
think.

Master. Do they bring them hither?

Friday. Yes, come 0'.- er 1. ither, come over
other place.

JIastc-r. And have you been with them here,
Frid a} '!

P: 5.4031. Yes, me been here, (pointing to the
northwest. of the island, being the side where
they used to land.)

Thus hating gotten "hat account I could
from mv man, I plainly understood, that he
h: id been as had as any of the rest of the can.
nibals, hating been fiwmetl} among tine sa-
tages who used to come on shore on the
farthest part of the island, upon the same
blond} occasions as he was brought hither For:
and some time afterJ carried him _" that place
where he pointed; and no sooner " . ye come.
there, but he piesentl) knew the gi'ound, Sig.
niftiner to me that he was once. there when
they ate up titenty men, two wo'mcn and a
voung child: but as he could not explain the
number in English, he did it in: so many129

stones in a row, making a sign to me to count
them.

My next question was, how far it was from
the island to the shore, and whether canoes
were not often lost in the ocean 'I to which he
answered, there was no danger; that no canoes
were ever lost; but that after a little way out
to the sea, there was a strong current, and a
wind always one way, in the afternoon. This
I thought at first to be no more than the sets
of tide, of going out or coming in ; but I after.
wards understood it was ficcasioned by the
great draught and reflux, of. the mighty river
Oroonoko, in the mouth or 'gulph of which, I
imagined my kingdom lay; and that the land
which I perceived to the west, and northwest
must be the great island Trinidad, on the north
of the river.

Well, you may be sure, this knowledge,
which the imperfect imformation of my man
had led me to, was very comfortable to me, and
made me so curious as to ask him, howl might
depart from this island, and get amongst those
white men? He told me, "Yes, yes, I might
go in two canoes." In two canoes, thought I,
what does my man mean. And, indeed it was
a long time before I understood his meaning,
which was, that it must be a large boat, as big
as two canoes, able to bear with the waves,
ind not so liable to be overwhelmed as one
must be.

Ibelieve there is no state of life but what
may be happy, if people would but endeavour130

for their part to make it so. He is not the
happiest man that has the most riches, but he
that IS content with what he hath. Before I had
my sen ant, I thought In) self miserable till I had
him , and now that I had enjoyed the happy
benefits of him, I still complained, and begged
a deliverance from a place of retirement, ease,
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently
blessed me. In a word, from this time, I enter.
rained some hopes, that one time or other,I
might find an opportunity to make my escape
from this island, and that this poor savage might
be a great furtherance thereto.

Inow began to instruct my servant, in the
saving knowledge oi the true Deity, in which
the directions of God's holy Spirit assisted me.

Friday, said I, you must know, that before
this worid was made, there was an Almighty
Being existing, by whose power all things
were made, and whose majesty shall have no
end. To be glorified and adored by beings of

alt-ear anlv nature, he created angels and arch.
angels, that IS, glorified spirits resembling him-
selt to encompass his throne, eternally singing
forth his praise, in the most heavenly sounds
and divine harmony.

I found it easy enough to imprint the right
notions in his mind of God: for nature assist-
ed me in all my arguments, to show him plain-
ly the necessity of a great and overruling, go.
verning power, at a secret directing providence,

and ot the equity and reasonableness of pay ing
adoration to our Creator.

J131

I then entered into a long discourse with
him, upon the subject of the world's redemp-
tion by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of
repentance preached from heaven, together
with an holy faith in our blessed Redeemer
Jesus Christ.

By the constant application I made of the
Scriptures, as I read them to my man Friday, I
earnestly endeavoured to make him understand
ever) part of them as much as lav 1n my power. 5
He also, on the other hand, by his Very serious
questions and enquiries, made me a much bet.
ter proficient in Scripture knowledge, than I
should have been by my own private reading
and study.

You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discource we had together, my man and I be.
came most intimately acquainted, and that
there was very little that I could say, but
what-Friday understood; and indeed, he Spoke
V-ery fluently, though it was but broken Eng.
lish. I now took a particular pleasure in re-
lating all mV' adventures, especially those that
occurred since my being cast on this island.
I made him understando that wonderful mys-
terV, as he conceived, of gunpowder and bul.
let, and taught him how to shoot. I also pre ,
seated to him a knife, which pleased him ex-
ceedinglv, making him a belt, with a frOg
hangian thereto, like those in which we wear
hangers 111 England; and, instead of a hanger
to put in the frog, I gaVe him a hatchet, which
was not only as Dgood, but men a better weapon132

upon many- occasions. In a word, my man
thus accoutred, looked upon himself as great
as Don Quixote, when that celebrated champion
went to combat the windmill.

I next gave him a very particular description
of my misfortune in being shipwrec ked; show-
mg him, as near as I could, the place where
the ship lay, vhich had been gone long before;
but I brought him to the ruins of my boat, which,
before, my whole strength could not move, but
now was almost rotten and fallen to pieces.
Iobserved my man Friday to View this boat
with an uncommon curiosity; which when he
had done, he stood pondering a great while,
and said nothing. At last, said I, Friday,
what makes you ponder so much? He replied,
" 0 master, me see like boat come to place at
my nation."

It was some time, indeed, before I under-
stood what my man meant; but examining
strictly into it, I plainly found, that such
another boat, resembling mine, had come
upon the country where he dwelt; that is
to say, by his farther explanation, that the
boat. was driven there through stress of wea.
ther.

Indeed Friday answered my demands very
well, making eyery thing plain to my under.
standimr: but hey and measure was I satisfied
when he told me With great warmth and ardour,
" 0 master, we save white mans from drown3"
upon which I immediately asked him, if there
were any white mans, as he. called them. in the133

boat; "Yes, yes,"s said he, "the boat full, very
full of white mans." How many, Friday, said I.

Hereupon he numbered his fingers, and count-
ed seventeen. And when I asked him what
became of them all, and whether they lived or
not? he replied, "Yes, master, they all live,
they be live among my nation." This informa.
tion put fresh thoughts into my head, that these
must be the very men who before I concluded
had been swallowed up in the ocean, after thev
hnd left their ship that had struck upon the
rocks of my kingdom, and after escaping the
fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore,
and committed themselves to the fury of the
(111101111111r Indians.

The manner ot their cruelties to one another, %
11l11e'1 consequently, as I thought, must he act-
ed with greater harbarity to strangers, created
in me a great anxiety, and made me still more
c1111011s to ask Friday concerning them. He
told me, he 1121s sme thev still lived the1e, hav.
mg resided among them above four years, and
that the savages gave them victuals to live upon.
But pray, Friday, sa1d I,11hence proceeded all
this good nature and generosity ? How came it
to pass that they did not kill and eat them, to
please their dc1 curing appetites; and occasion
so splendid an ente1tainment among them?

'1711,no," said hid-111', "they not kill 'em,
they make brother with 13111;" by wl ich I un.
derstood tl1e1e 1111s a tiuce betueen them.
And then I had a more favourable opinion of
the Indians, upon Fridays uttering the words
21134

"My nation t'other nation no eat man's but
when mans make war fight :" as though 116
had said, that neither those of his kingdom, nor
any other nations that he knew of, ever ate
their fellowzcreatures, but such as their law
of arms allowed to be devoured: that is, those
miserable captives, whose misfortune it should
be to be made prisoners of war.

Some considerable time after, upon a very
pleasant day, in most serene weather, my man
and I stood upon the top of a hill, on the
island, whence I had once before beheld the
continent of America. I could not tell imme.
diately what was the matter: for suddenly
Friday, fell a jumping and dancing as if he
had been mad; and upon my demanding the
reason ofhis behaviour, "0 joy, " said he, " 0
glad! there see 1113' cou11t13', tl1e1e mv nation,
there white mans gethcr". ' hid indeed such
a rapturous sense of pleasure, appeared 1n his
countenance, that his eyes had an uncommon
sparkling and brightness, and such a strange
eagerness, as it he had a loncring desire to be
in his 03111 country again. Thisb made me not
so well satisfied with my 11111.11 Frida3 as be.
to1e , for b3 this appearance, I made no dis-
pute, but that if he could get back thither
again, he would not only be unmindful of
what religion I had taught him, but likewise
of the great obligation he owed me for his
wonderful deliverance: na3, that he would
not only inform his countrymen of me, but
accompany hundreds of them to my kingdom,135

and make me a miserable sacrifice, like those
unhappy wretches taken in battle.

Indeed I was very much to blame to have
these cruel, and unjust suspicions, and must
freely own I wronged the poor creature very
much, who was of a quite contrary temper.
And had he had that discerning acuteness
which many Europeans have, he would eer.
tainly have perceived my coldness and indif.
ference, and also have been very much con.
cerned upon that account.

As we were walking up the same hill another
day, when the weather was so hazy at sea,
that I could not perceive the continent, Friday,
said I, don't you wish yourself to he in your
own country, your own nation, among your
old friends and acquaintances? " Yes," said
he, "me much 0 glad to be at my own na.
tion." And "hat would you do there, Fri.
day? "'ould you turn wild again, eat man's
flesh, and be a savage as you were formerly?
" No, no," {answered he, full of concern, and
shaking his head) "Friday now tell them to
live good, tell them pray God, tell them to eat
corn, bread, cattle, flesh, milk, no eat man
again." But surely, replied I, if you should
offer to do all this, they will kill you; and to
manifest their contempt of such instruction, eat
you up when they have done. He then put on.
a grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance,
saying, " No, they no kill me, they willing love
learn :" that is, that they would be very willing

to learn; adding withal, "that they had learned
' Overy much of the bearded 11121115 that 92212212 in
the boat." "'ill you, said I, go back again,
Friday? He smiled at that, and told me, 1hat
he could not swim so far. But said I, I will

said, Itook him With me to the other side of
the island, where my frigate lay, and then
taking it from under water (for I always kept
it sunk for fear of a discovery) we both went
into it to see how it would manage such an ex-
pedition.

And really never could any be more dex-
terous in rowing than my faithful servant, mak-
ing the boat go as fast again asIcould. Well,
now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to your
much desired nation? But, instead of meet-
ing with that cheerfulness I expected, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my saying
so; which indeed at first surprised me, till he
made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat's being too small to go so far a voy-
age. Upon which, I let him understand I had
a much bigger; and, accordingly, the next
day went to the place, where the first boat
lay, which I had made, when all the strength
I had, or art I could use, failed me in my
attempt to get it into the water: but now it
having lain in the sun two and twenty years,
and no care being taken of it all that while,
it became in a manner rotten. My man
told me, that such a boat would do very
well for the purpose, sufficient to carry
"enough vittle, dring, bread," for that was his
manner of talking. In short, my mind being
strongly fixed, upon my design of going over
with him to the continent, I very plainly
told him, that we would both go and make a

boat full as big, and more proportionable than
M 2138

that, wherein he might safely return to his own
nafion.

Go your way, since you desire it, and leave
me alone by myself, as I was before I saved
your life.

Never was any creature more thunderstrucl;
than Friday was at these words, " Go me away,
leave master away," said he, after a long
silence, " No, no, Friday die, Friday live not
master gone ;"' as though he had said, I neither
can nor will live, if my master sends me from
him. Friday felt towards me the greates:
gratitude, and the most sincere love; he found
me not only his deliverer, but his preserver
and comforter; not a severe and cruel tyrant,
but a kind, loving, and affable friend. He
wanted for no manner of sustenance; and
when he was ill, or out of order, I was his
physician, not only for his body, but his soul;
and therefore no wonder was it, that such an
innocent creature, long since divested of his
former natural cruelty, should have an uncom-
mon concern at so cruel a separation from me,
which pierced him to the very soul, and mad:
him desire even to die, rather than live without
me.

After I had told Friday, in a very careless
manner, that he should be at his liberty as soon
as the boat was made, the language of his eyes
expressed all imaginable confusion; when,
immediarely running to one of his hatchets,
which he used to wear as a defensive weapon,
he gives it into my hand, with a heart so full,139

that he Could scarcely Speak. F riday, said I,
what is it you mean? What must I do with this?
" Only kill Fiiday," said he, "Friday care not
live long." But what must I kill you for? re-
plied ] again. " Ah, dear master, what made
you Friday save from eat a me 11p, so keep long
Friday, make Friday love God, and now Friday
send away, never see Friday more." And
while he spoke thus, the tears ran down his
cheeks in such a plentiful manner, that I had
much ado to refrain from weeping aiso when ]
beheld the poor creature's afl'ection: so that]
was forcedto comfort him in the best manner I
could, which I did, by tei'iing him, if he was
content to abide with me, I should be ever will.
ing to keep hin .

After Friday's grief was somewhat abated,
more fully to convince me of his affection, he
said, " 0 master, me not care to be in my na-
tion, leave you here, me desire nation learn
good, that's all ;" meaning, that his desire was
for the conversion of that barbarous people;
and that we wished me to go with him. And
indeed, I began to desire to go also, from my
late discourse with Friday, about these seven.
teen white bearded men, that had been driven
upon the barbarian coast ; whom I designed to
join, as the only means to further our escape.
To which intent, my man and I went to search
for a proper tree to fell, whereof we might
make a perigna or canoe, to undertake the
voyage; and, indeed, we were not long in find.
ing one fit for our purpose, there being enough140

of wood in the island to have built a fleet of
large vessels, but the thing we principally
wanted, was, to get one so near the water, that
We might launch it after it was finished, and
not commit so horrid a mistake as I had done
once before.

\Vell, after a great search for what was best
and most Convenient, Friday, at last, whose '

judgment in such atl'airs was much superior to

mine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most
fitting for it. But though 1113' man exceeded
me i: 1 the 13110\\10(l'Te oi the. most proper tree
3'et I shoned him a much better and cleaner
33":13 to make a canoe than everhe knew Let01e ;
fox he was 1111 hunting the hollon or cavity of
the tree, in 011101 to make this boat; but I then

told him how 33e might do it 33ith tools, teach-
inw him at the same time how to use them,
which indeed he did 3013' dexteiously ; so that
in a month's time 336 finished it, making it
3'e13deg hands '1'1me, 113' cutting: the outside in the
true shape 0! a boat. Altet this, it took us a
full fortnight before 339 could get her into the
Water, which we did, as it were, inch by inch,
upon great rollers: but when she was in, she
would have carried twenty men, with all the
ease imaginable.

As I was very well pleased, 3011 may be
sure, at theianncliinerofthis man ofwar ot mine,
I was no less amazed to behold with wh'1 at dex-
terity 1113 man could manage her, turn her, and
waddle her along \Vell, Friday, said I, what
do 3'ou think of? it new ? Doymi think this will141

carry us over? "Yes master," said he, "we
venture over well, though great blow wind." .
But my design was yet farther, which he was
insensible of; and that to make a mast and a
sail, and provide her with an anchor and cable.
As to a mast that was no difficult thing at all
to procure . so fixing upon a straight'3 301mg
cedar tree, which I found near the place, (great
plenty 01 it aboundingin the island) and setting
Friday to cut it down,I gave him particular
directions how to shape and order it . but as to
the sail, that, Imanaged m3selt I very well
knew I had some old ",ones or pieces of sails
enough, which had lain six and twent3 years by
me ; that not being careful to preserve them, as
thinking I should have no occasion to use them
any more, when I came to look over them, I
found them almost all rotten, except two; and
with these I went to work, and after a great
deal of pains and awkward tedious stichmg for
want of needles, at length I finished a. three.
cornered ugly thing like that we call in Eng.
land, a shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a
boom at the bottom, and a small sprit at the
top, like those which our long-boats use, and
which I very well knew how to manage,
especially since it was like that which I had in '
my patron's fishing boat, when with my boy
Xury,I made my escape from the barbarian
shore.

It was nearly two months, I think, before I
completed this work, that is, the rigging, and
fitting up my mast and sails; and indeed thev142

were nicely done, having made a small stay,
and a sail, or toresail to it, to assist, it we
should turn to the windward , and, which was
still more, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her,
to steer with; and though I was but. a very
indifferent ship-right, yet, as l was sensible
of the great usefulness and absolute necessity
of a thing like this, I applied myself to it with
such a constant. application, that at last I ac-
complished my design; but. what with the many
dull coutrivant es I had about it, and the failure
of many things, it cost me as much pains in
orderingr as in making the boat. Besides,
when all this was done, I had my man 1'0
teach "hat belonged to its nudgration; for
though he verx "ill understood lion to pad-
dle a c 1210c alone, he was an utter stramrer to
as sail and a rudder, and "as amazed "hen he
sau me u (it? the bout to and again in the sea,
by then -, and how the sail jibbed and filled
this wav or that. wav, as the course we sailed
changed. After some time, and a little use,
Imadea lllhese things very familiar to him,
so that he became an expert sailor, except in
relation to the compass, and that. 1 could make
him understand but little of. But as it hap-
pened, there was seldom occasion for it, there
being but little cloudy weather, and scarcely
any fog in those parts ; the stars were always
visible in the night, and the shore b} day, ex-
cept in the r: in} seas on, "hit h confined es ery
one 0 his habitation. Thus entered in to the
save-manilawentieth year of my reign or cap-143

  
   
   
   
  
   
 

irity, which you please, (the last three of
\l'llCl'l, blessed with the comp pany of my man
"inlay, ought not to be reckoned) I kept the
anniversary of my landing here with' the same
lumkthlness to God for his tender mercies, as
1 did before; and certainly as I had great
ause for thankful acknowledgment for my de-
.iierance at first, I had much greater now for
cuch singular and additional testimonies of the
ewe ol P1ovidence oxer me, in all my dis-
lres ses of both bodx and mind, and the great
liones I had ot being eH'ectually and speedily
relirered : for I had a strong impression upon
my mind, that I should not be another year in
this island. But, however, I still continued on
with 1111' husbandry, digninu, planting, and
fencing as usual: gratlie1inorD and curing my
grapes, and doing all otherc things that were
necessary.

And now the rainy season beginning to
come on, obliged me to keep the longer
11itl1in doors :but before this, I brought my
new vessel into the creek, where I had
la uded my rafts s, from the ship; so we wait-
ed for the months of November and Decem-
ber, in which I designed to venture over the
ocean. '

No sooner did the seasonable weather begin
h draw near, but so much 11 as I elevated with
this new designed adtenture, that I daily pre-
Paied for the voyage. The first thing that I
bought on was, to 13} by a can tam quantity of
{ma isions, as a snfiicient store for such an144

xpedition, intending in a week or a fort-
night's time to open the dock, and launch out
the boat for that purpose. But. one morning,
as I was Verv busy upon something necessary
for this occasion,I called Friday to me, and
hid him to go to the sea shore, and see it he
could find a t,turtle or tortoise, a thing which
we commonly had once a week, as much upon
account of the eggs, as for the sake of the
flesh. He had not been long gone, but he
came running back, as though he was pur.
sued for life, and as it were flew over my
outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the
mound. or steps he set his feet on: before I
had time to enquire the reason of his precipi-
tation, he cries out, "0 dear master, 0 sorrow!
sorrow! Bad! 0 bad!" Why, what's the
matter, Friday? said I. " O yonder, yonder,"
said 110, "there be one, two, three canoes! two,
three." ,

Surelv (thought I) there must be six, by
mV man's w ay of reckoning; but on a strict-
er enquiiv, I found thereb were but three.
W'ell,F1idaV', said I, don't be terrified. I
warrant Vou we will defend ourselves against
them.----But though I comforted him in the
best manner I could, the poor creature
trembled so, that I scarcely knew what to do
with him: " 0, master," said he, "they come
look Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me
up.3,

Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me up as .
well as you, and my danger is as great as145

your's. But since it is so, we must resolve to
fight for our lives. What say you 'I Can you
fight Friday? " Yes," said- he very-faintly,
" me shoot, me kill what I can, but there come
great many number." That'sgno matter, said
I again, our guns will terrify'thosaitha we do
not kill; I am very willing to stand b ypu to
the last drop of my blood. ""4...

Now, tell me, if you will do the like by
me, and obey my orders in whatsoever I com.
mand'l . Friday then answered, " 0 master,
me lose life for you, me die when you bid
die." - Thus concluding alF'questions concern-
ing his fidelity, I ordered-him to take the two
fowling pieces, which 'we' always carried,
and load them with large swan-shot, as big as
small pistol bullets; then I took four muskets
and loaded them with two slugs, and five .
small bullets each; charging my two pistols
each with a brace, I hang my great sword, as
customary, naked to my side, and gave Friday
his hatchet, as a mast excellent weapon for
defence. ' .

' Thus prepared, I took my perspective glass,
and went up to the side of the hill, to see what
Icould discover; and I perceived very soon,
by my glass, that there were one and twenty
savages, three pfidners, and three canoes, and
their chief concern seemed to be the tri-
umphant banquet upon three poor human
bodies, a thing which by this time I had ob-
served was very common with them. Upon
Which I called to Friday ; and showing him a

N146

great tree, that was just at the corner of the
wood, near which they were, I ordered him to
repair thither, and bring me word, if he could
plainly perceive their actions; accordingly he
did as I commanded him, and came back with
this melancholy story, that they were all about
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their pri.
soners; and that another lay bound upon the
sand, a little distance from them, whom they
designed for their next sacrifice; and this he
told me, was not one of their nation, but one
of those very bearded men, who was driven by
a storm into their country, and whom he had
so often spoken to me about. You may be
sure, that, upon hearing this, my soul was
ready to sink within me: when ascending up
into a tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with
his hands tied with flags or things resembling
rushes, being covered with clothes, and seem-
ing to be an European. From the tree where
1 took this prospect, I perceived another tree,
and a thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
nearer to them than where I was, which by
taking a small circle round, I might come at
undiscovered, and then I should be within half
a shot of these devourers. I therefore got
behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree ; and then I as.
cended to a little rising ground, not above
eighteen yards distance, and there I had a full
view of these creatures, and could perceive all
their actions.147

Such a sight did then appear, as obliged
me not to lose a moment's time. No less than
nineteen of these dreadful wretches sat upon
the ground, close huddled together, express-
ing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous
an entertainment; and they had just sent the
other two to murder this poor unhappy Chris-
tian, and bring him limb by limb to their fire;
for they were then just going to untie the
bands from his feet. Hereupon, immediately
turning to my man, Now, Friday, said I,
mind what I say, fail in nothing, but do ex-
actly as you see me do. All which he pro-
mising to perform, I set down one of my mus-
kets, and the fowling-piece upon the ground,
and Friday did the same by his; and with
the other musketI took my aim at the savages,
bidding him to do the like :_ Are you ready,
said I; " Yes, master," said be, why then fire
at them said I; and at that very moment I gave
fire likewise.

I only killed one and wounded two; but my
man Friday, taking his aim much better than
I, killed two, and wounded three. You may
be sure they were in a dreadful consternation,
at such an unexpected disaster; and those
Who had yet escaped our penetrating shot,
immediately jumped upon their feet, but were
in such a confusion, that they knew not which
Way to run or look; not knowing from whence
their destruction came. We threw down our
nieces, and took up others, giving a second148

dreadful volley; but as they were only loaded
with swan--Sher, or small pistol bullets, we
perceived only two of them fall, though many
were wounded who ran yelling and screaming
about like mad creatures. Now, Friday, said
I, lay down your piece, and take up the rims-
ket, and follow me. He did so with great
courage, when showing ourselves to the sa-
vages, we gave a great shout, and made direct.
ly to the poor victim, who would have been sa-
crificed, had not our first fire obliged the
butchers, with three others, to jump into a
canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them,
at which shot I thought he had killed them all,
by reason of their falling to the bottom of the
boat; however he killed two, and mortally
wounded a third. In the mean time I out the
flags that tide the. hands and feet of the poor
creature, and lifting him up, asked him in the
Portuguese tongue What he was? he'answered
me in Latin, " Christianusz" but so very weak
and faint that he could scarcely stand or speak.
And I next asked him, what countryman he
was? He said " Espaniola," and then uttered
all the thankfulness imaginable for his deliver-
ance. Signior, (said I with as much Spanish
as I was master of) let us talk afterwards but
fight new; here, take this sword and pistol, and
do what you can. And indeed, he did so with
such courage and intrepidity, that he cut two
of them to pieces in an instant. I ordered Fri-
day to run for the guns we had leg>> at the tree.149

which he brought to me with great swifiness,
and then I gave him my musket, while I ldaded
the rest. But now there happened a fierce en.
counter between the Spaniard and one of the
savages, who made at him with one of their
wooden swords; and though the former was as
brave as could be expected, hailing twice
wounded his enemy in the head; vet being
weak and faint, the Indian had thrown him
upon the ground, and was wresting my sword
out of his hand, which the Spaniard very wise-
ly quitting, drew out his pistol, and shot him
through the body before I could come near
him, though I was running to his assistance
As to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches
with his hatchet, dispatching three, but the
rest were too nimble for him. The Spaniard
taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded
two, who running into the wood-Friday pur-
sued and killed ; but the other, notwkh'standing
his wounds, plunged himself into'thefgba, and
swam to those who were left in the canoe', which
with one wounded, were all that escaped out
of one and twenty.

The savages in the canoe worked very hard
to get out of our reach, and Friday was as
eager in pursuing th'eifitt'- d, indeed, I was no

I found another poor creature, bound hand and
foot for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had
been, with very little life in him. Immediately
I unbound him, and would have helped him
up; but he could neither stand nor speak but
groaned so piteously, as thinking he was un-
bound in order to be slain. Hereupon I bid
Friday speak to him, and tell him of his deliver.

poor wretch drink a little, which, with the joy.
ful news he had received, so revived his heart,
that he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday
began to hear him speak, and look more fully
in his face, it would have moved any one to
tears to perceive his uncommon transports
of joy; for he kissed, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his
hands, beat his face and head, then sung and
jumped about again, like a distracted creature:
so that it was a great while before I could
make him speak to me, or tell me what was
the matter with him ; but when he came to the
liberty of his _speech, at last he told me it was
his father.

Here, indeed, I was infinitely moved to see
that dutiful and tender afi'ection this poor sa-
vage had to his aged parent. He would sit
down by him in the boat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherish him: then he tool:151

his arms and ankles, which were stiff and
numbed, with binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his hands; by which means, per-
ceiving what the case was,I gave him some
rum, which proved of great benefit to him.

While we were busy in this action, the sa.
vages had gotten almost out of sight; and
happy it was we did not pursue them: for
there arose from the northwest, such a violent
storm, which continued all night long, that I
could not suppose otherwise but that they were
all drowned. After this, I called Friday to me
and asked him, if he had given his father any
bread? He shook his head, and said, " None,
not, one hit, me eat a op all ;" so I gave him
a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried
for this end. I likewise gave him two or three
bunches of raisins for his father.

Away he then runs out of the boat as if he
was bewitched, with such an extraordinary
swit'tness, that he was out of sight as it were in
an instant; but, at his return, I perceived -tim
slacken his pace, because he had something in
his hand. And this I found to be, as he ap-
proached nearer, an earthen jug with some
water for his father, with two more cakes of
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Be-
ing very thirsty myself I drank some of the
water, of which when his father had drank suf-
ficiently, it more revived his spirits than all the
rum I had given him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him152

to carry one of the cakes, and some water to
the Spaniard, who was reposing himself upon
a green place under the shade of a tree, but so
weak, that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which, I ordered
Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum,
as he did his father's. But every minute he
was employed in this, he would cast his eyes
towards the boat, where he left his father
sitting; who suddenly disappearing, he flew
like lightning to him, and finding he only laid
himself down to ease his limbs, he returned
back to me presently, and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him
to the boat in order to be conveyed to my
dwelling, where I would take care of him.
Upon which, Friday took him upon his back,
and so carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father; and presently stepping out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it
along the shore faster than I could walk, though
the .wind blew very hard too; and having
brought them safe to the creek, away he runs
to fetch the other canoe, which he brought to
the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land;
then wafting me over, he took our new guests
out of the boat; but so weak were they, that
I was forced to make a. kind of a hand-barrow;
and when I came to my castle, not being wil-
ling to make an entrance into my wall, we
made them a handsome tent, covered with old

sails, and boughs of trees, making two good153

beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon
and cover them. Thus, like an absolute king,
over subjects who owed their lives to me, I
thought myself very considerable.

To get provisions for my poor weak subjects,
I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat;
which when he had done, I cut off the hinder
quarters, and chopping it into small pieces,
boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice
into the broth. This I carried into their tent, set
a table, dined with them, and encouraged them.
Friday was my interpreter to his father, and
indeed to the Spaniard too, who spoke the lan-
guage of the savages pretty well. After dinner,
I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms
from the field of battle, and the next day to
bury the dead bodies, which he did accordingly.

And now I made Friday enquire of his fa-
ther, whether he thought those savages had
escaped the late stormc in their canoe; and if
so, \1 hether they would not return with a force
100 great for us to resist? He answered, that
he thought it impossible they could outlive the
storm: or if they were driven southwardly,
they would come to a land where they would
as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the sea And suppose they had
attained their own country, the strangeness of
their fatal and bloody attack would make them
tell their people that the rest of them were
killed by thunder and lightning, not by the
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits154

(meaning Friday and me) who were sent from
above to destroy them. And this, be said, he
knew, because he heard them say the same to
one another. And indeed he was in the right
on't; for I have heard since, that these four
men gave out, that whoever went to that en.
chanted island, would be destroyed by fire from
the gods.

No canoes appearing some time after, asI
expected, my apprehensions ceased; instead
of which my former thoughts of a voyage took
place, especially when Friday's father assured
me I should have good usage in his nation. As
to the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more
of his countrymen, and Portuguese, who had
been shipwrecked, made their escape thither;
that though they were in union with the sa-
vages, yet they were very miserable for want
of provisions and other necessaries. When I
asked him about the particulars of his voyage,
he answered, that their ship was bound from
Rio de la Plata to the Havana; that when
the ship was lost. only five men perished in the
ocean; the rest having saved themselves in the
boat, were now landed on the main continent.
And what do they intend to do there? said I.
He replied, they had concerted measures to
escape by building a vessel, but that they had
neither tools nor provisions, so that all their
designs came to nothing. Supposing (said I)
I should make a proposal, and invite them here,
would they not carry me prisoner to New155

Spain? He answered no; for he knew them to
be such honest men, as would scorn to act with
such inhuman baseness to their deliverer: that
if I pleased, he and the old savage would go
over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an answer: that they should all swear fide.
lity to me as their leader, upon the holy sacra-
ment; and, for his part, he would not only do
the same, but stand by me to the last drop of
his blood, should there be occasion.

These solemn assurances made me resolve to
grant them relief, and to send these two over
for that purpose; but. when every thing was
ready, the Spaniard raised an objection, which
carried a great deal of weight in it: " You
know, Sir, said he, that having been some time
with you, I cannot but be sensible that your
stock of rice and corn may be sufficient, per.
haps, for us at present, but not for them, should
they come over presently, much less to victual
a vessel for an intended voyage. And there-
fore, my advice is, to wait another harvest, and
in the mean time, cultivate and improve some
more land, whereby we may have plenty of
provisions, in order to execute our design."

This advice of the Spaniard I approved ex.
tremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
that I esteemed him ever after. And thus we
all four went to work Upon some more land, and
against seedtime, we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow 22
bushels of barley on, and 16 jars of rice,which156

was in short all the seed we had to spare. As
we were four in number, and by this time all
in good health, we feared not an hundred of
Indians, should they venture to attack us; and
while the corn was growing, I pitched upon
some trees, fit to build us a large vessel, in
case the Spaniards came over; which being
marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was
now my privy counsellor, to oversee and direct
the work. Ililiewise increased my flocks of
goats, by shooting the wild dams, and bringing
home their kids to my enclosure; nor did I
neglect the grape season, but cured then: as
usual, though I had such a quantity now, as
would have filled SO barrels with raisins.

And thus all of us being employed, they in
working, and I in providing for them, till har-
wst came, God Almighty blessed the increase
of it so much, that from twenty-two bushels
of barley, we threshed out two hundred and
twenty, and the like quantity of rice, sufficient
to victnal a ship fit to carry me and all the
Spaniards to any part of America.

Thus the principal objection being answer-
ed, by a sufficient stock of provisions, I sent
my two ambassadors over to the main land,
with a regal authority to administer the oaths
of allerri ance and fidelity, and hat-e an instru-
ment signed under their hands, though I net er
asked whether thev had pen, ink, or paper:
when giting each of them a musket with eight157

charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a
fair gale, on a day when the moon was at full.

Scarcely a fortnight had passed over my
head; but, impatient for their return, I laid me
down to sleep one morning, when a Strange
accident happened, which was ushered in by
my man's coming running to me, and ca.ling
aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come. Upon which, not dreaming of any
danger, out I jumped from my bed, put on my
clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
when looking towards the sea, I perceived a
boat, about a league and a half distant, star ding
in For the shore, with a fair wind. Ibeheld
they did not come from the side where the land
lay on, but from the southmost end of the island.
So these being none of the people we wanted,
I ordered Friday to lie still, till such time as I
came down from the mountain, which, with my
ladder, I now ascended, in order to discover
more fully what they were; and now, with the
help of my perspective glass, I plainly perceiv.
ed an English ship, which I concluded it to be,
by the fashion of its long boat; and which fill.
ed me with such uncommon transports of joy,
that I cannot tell how to describe; and yet
some secret doubts hung about me, proceeding
from I know not what cause, as though I had ,
reason to be on my guard.

Not long it was, before I perceived the boat
to approach the shore, as though they looked

O

P158

for a place where they might conveniently land;
and at last they ran their boat on the shore upon
the beach, about half a mile distance; which
proved so much the happier for me, since, had
they come into the creek, they had landed just
at my door, and might not only have forced me
out of my castle, but plundered me of all I
had 1n the world. Now I was fully convinced
they were all Englishmen, three of whom were
unarmed and bound ; when immediately. the
first four or five leaped on shore, and took
those three out of the boat as prisoners, one
of whom I could perceive used the most pas.
sionate gestures of entreaty, affliction and dc.
spair, while the others in a less degree showed
abundance of concern.

Not knowing the meaning of this, I beckoned
to Friday, who was below, to ascend the menu.
taln, and likewise view this sight. "0 mas.
ter," said he to me, " y on see English mans eat
prisoners as well as savage mans." And do
\ ou think they will eat them, Friday? said I.
: Yse ," said Friday, "they eat aall up." No,
no,s said I, Friday, I am much more concerned
lest they murder them; but as for eating them
up, that I am sure they will never do.

And now I not only lamented my misfortune
in not having the Spaniard and Savage with
_ me, but also that I could not come within shot
of them unperceived, (they having no firearms
amcng them) and save these three men, whom '
I thought they were going to kill with their [159

swords. But some comfort it was to me, that
I perceived they were set at liberty to go where
they pleased, the rascally seamen scattering
about as though they had a mind to see the
place; and so long did they negligently ram-
ble, that the tide had ebbed so low, as to leave
the boat aground. Nor were the two men
that were in her more circumspect; for having
drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast
asleep; but one of them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move it, he hallooed out to
the rest, who zDmade all possible expedition to
come to him; but, as Providence ordered it,
all their force was ineffectual to launch her,
when I could hear them speak to one another,
"Why let her alone, Jack. can't ye, she'll float
next tidez" by which woids I was fully con.
vinced they were my own country men. I this
while lay very quiet, as being fully sensible
it could be no less than ten hours before the
boat would be afloat, and then it would be so
dark, that they could not easily perceive me,
by which means I should be at more liberty to
hear their talk, and observe all their motions ,
not but that I prepared for my defence . yet
as I had another sort of enemy to combat with,
I acted with more caution. I took two fusees
on my shoulder, and gave Friday three mus-
kets' , besides my formidable goanskin, and
monstrous cap, made me look as fierce and ten
rible as Hercules of old, especially when two160

pistols were stuck in my belt, and my naked
sword was hanging by my side.

The three poor distressed creatures, too
anxious to get any repose, were however,
seated under the shade ofa great tree, about a
quarter of a mile from me.

Upon which, without any more ado,I ap-
proached towards them, with my man following
behind me, and, before I was perceived, I
called aloud to them in Spanish, what are ye
gentlemen '2

At these words they started up in great con-
fusion, when they beheld the strange figure I
made ; they returned no answer, but seemed as
ifthey would fly from me : Gentlemen, (said I
in English) don't be afraid, perhaps you have u
friend nearer than you expect. " He must be
from heaven," said one of them, gravely pulling
off his hat, "for we are past all help in this
world." All help is from heaven, said I, but
Sir as I have perceived every action between
you and these brutes since your landing only
inform me how to assist you, and Iwill do it to
the utmost of my power.

Am I talking with God or man? said he, in
melting tears. Are you of' human kind, or an
angel? Sir,said I, " my poor habit will tell you
I am a man, and an Englishman, willing to
assist you, having but this servant only, here
are arms and ammunition : tell freely your
condition, can we save you '1'" The story, said
he is too long to relate, since our butchers161

are so near: but, Sir, I was master of that ship,
my men have mutined, and it is as a favour
they have put my mate, this passenger, and me,
on shore without murdering us, though we ex-
pect nothing but peiishingo here. "Are your
enemies gone? " said I. No, replied he
(pointing ate a thicket,) there they lie, while
my heart trembles, lest, having seen and heard
us, they should murder us all. " Have they
firearms?" said I. They have buttwo pieces,
said he, one of which is left in the boat. He
also told me, there were two enormous villians
amongst them, that were the authors of this
mutiny, who, if they were killed or seized,
the r- st might be induced to return to their
obedience.

'When he had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave" him and his two compa-
nions each ot~ them a gun, with powder and
ball sufficient, and firing myself, killed one of
the Captain's enemies, and wounded the other
is ho ea getly called for assistance , but the
Captain0 (who had reserved his piece) coming
up to him, " Siriuh, " said he, " 'tis too late to
call for assistance, } on s hould rather cry to God
to pardon vour villainv :" and so knocked him
down with the stock of his gun: three others
here also slightly wounded, who, at my up.
preach, cried out for mercy. This the Captain
v1 tinted, upon condition that they would su ear
t) be true to him in recovering the ship, which

(hr-)- solemnl}r did: however I obliged the
0'2162

Captain to keep them bound. After which
I sent Friday and the Captain's mate to secure
the boat, and bring away the oars and sail;
when the men, seeing their late distresse
Captain. now their conqueror, submitted to be
bound also. And then it was, that having
more liberty, I related the adventures of my
whole life, which he heard with a serious at.
tention. After 1111s, I carried him and his two
Companions into my little fortified castle, show-
ed them all my conveniences, and, when this
was over, we began to consider about reg-ain-
ing the ship: he said that there were twenty.
six hands on board, who knowing their lives
were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and
mutiny, were so very hardened, that it would
be dangerous for our small compan} to attack
tl1e111."lhis was a 1easonahle inference, 111.
deed , but something we must resolve on, and
immediately put in execution: we therefore
caved the boat upon the beach so high that
'siee c-ruld not shoot offat high water mark, and
1.1121311: 11 hole in her not easy to he stopped; so
that all the. signals they gave for the boat to
'1111. on board new in vain. This obliued
them to send another boat ashore, with ten
119:1 aimed, whose faces the Captain plainly
descried, the boatswain being the chief offi-
cer; but he said there were three honest lads
amen" them, who were forced into the conspi-
1.1m. Heieupon, It! gave him fresh courage,
(I'm 1 had perceived he 11 as in concern) in the163

mean while securing our prisoners, except two,
whom we took to our assistance, we thought
ourselves able enough to endure a battle.
When the sailors landed, and beheld their
boat in that condition, they not only hallooed,
but fired, for their companions to hear, yet
they received no answer. This struck them
with horror and amazement, thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if
they would return to the ship. I could per-
ceive the Captain's countenance change at this, _
till, of a sudden, three men were ordered to
look after the boat, while the other seven leapt
on shore, in order to search for their compa.
nions: and, indeed, they came to the brow of
the hill, near my anotent castle, from whence
they could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shoutingand hallooing till tired and
weary, they at length seated themselves under
a spreading tree. My opinion was, that no-
thing could be done till night, when I might
use some artifice to get them all out of the
boat; but of a sudden they started up, and
made towards the seaside; hereupon I or.
dered Friday and the Captain's mate to go
over the creek, and halloo as loud as they
could, and so decoying them into the woods,
come round to me again. And, this, indeed.
had good effect; for they followed the noise,
till coming westward to the creek, they called
for their boat to carry them over, and taking
one of the men out of her, left two to look
at'ter her, having fastened her to the stump of164

alittle tree on the shore. Hereupon imme-
diately the captain and our party passing the
creek, out of their sight, we surprised them
both, by the Captain's knocking down one and
ordering the other to surrender upon pain of
death, and who, being the honestest of them
all, sincerely joined with us. By this time it
was pretty late; when the rest returning to
their boat, which they found aground in the
creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran
about wringing their hands, crying it was an
enchanted island, and that they should be all
murdered by spirits or devils. My men would
willingly have fallen upon them, but I would
not agree to hazard any of our party. But to
be more certain, Friday and the Captain crawl.
ed upon their hands and fe', as near as pos.
sible ; and when the boatswain approached in
sight, so eager was the Captain, that he fired,
and killed him on the spot: Friday wounded
the next man, and a third ran away. Hereupon
I advanced with my whole army ; and it being
dark, I ordered the man we had surprised in the
boat, to call them by their names, and to parley
with them. Accordingly he called out aloud,
" Tom Smith, Tom Smith!" He answered,
"VVho's that ;" "Robinson!" answered the
other, " For God's sake, Tom, surrender im-
mediately, or you're all dead men." "Who
must we surrender to '1" says Smith. " To our
Captain and a large force here, who have taken
me prisoner, wounded \Vill F yre, and killed the
boatswain." " Shall we have quarter then C"1'65

said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out,
"You Smith, you know my voice, surrender
immediately, and you shall have your lives
granted, except Will Atkins." Hereupon At.
kins cries out, "What have I done, Captain,
more than the rest, who have been as bad as
me ;" but that was a lie, for he was the person
that laid hold of him, and bound him. However,
he was ordered to submit to the governor's
mercy, for such was'I called. And so laying
down their arms, we bound them all, and
seized on their boat.

After this, the Captain expostulated with
them, telling them that the governor was an
Englishman, who might execute them there;
but he thought they would be sent to England.
Hereupon they implored the Captain to inter.
cede for their livesand begged they might not
be sent to England. This answered our pro.
ject for seizing the ship. For, after sending
them, l'ast bound, to the cave, I sent the Cap.
tain to treat with them in the governor's name,
offering them pardon if they would assist in re.
covering the ship. Upon which, they all pro-
mised to stand by him till the last drop of their
blood; and whoever acted treacherously should
be hanged in chains upon the beach. They
were all released on these assurances: and then-
the Captain repaired to the other boat, making
his passenger Captain of her, and gave him
four men well armed; while himself, his mate,
and five more, went in the other boat. By
midnight they came within call of the ship,166

when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail her,
and tell them that with great difficulty they had
found the men at last. But while they were
discoursing, the Captain, his mate, and the rest
entered, and knocked down the second mate,
and carpenter, secured those that were upon

the deck, by putting them under hatches, while,

the other boat's crew entered and secured the
forecastle; they 'then broke into the round.
house, where the mate, after some resistance,
shot the pirate Captain through the head, upon
which all the rest yielded themselves prisoners.
And thus the ship being recovered, the joyful
signal was fired, which I heard with the great-
est joy imaginable . nor was it long before he
brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's
mouth, wherecomingtome nawares, "There,"
says he, " my dearest afrienend deliverer, there
is your ship, and we are your servants :"
comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon in
his arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we
were tenderly embracing each other.

Nothing new remained, but to consult what
we should do with the prisoners, whom he
thought it was not safe to take on board.
Hereupon, concerting with the Captain, Idress-
ed myself 1n one of this suits, and sending for
them, told them, that as I was going to leave
the island with all my people, if they would
tarry there, their lives should be spared; if not,
they should be hanged at the first port they
came to. They agreed to stay. Hereupon I
told them my whole story, charging them to be

V167

kind to the Spaniards that were expected, gave
them all my arms, and informing them of every
thing necessary for their subsistence, I and my
man Friday went on board. But the next
morning two of the men came swimming to the
ship's side, desiring the Captain to take them
on board, though he hanged them afterwards,
complaing mightily how barbarously the others
used them. Upon which I prevailed with the
Captain to take them in; and having received
some punishment, they proved more honest for
the future. And so I bid farewell to this
island, carrying along with me my money, my
parrot, umbrella, and goat-skin cap ; setting
sail December 12, 1687, after twenty-eight
years, two months, and nineteen days' resi-
dence, and landing in England, June 11, 1688
after five and thirty years' absence from my
own country, which rendered me altogether a
stranger there. ' I '

F OUR Y EARS.

I.

I AM monarch of all I survey,
My right there is none to dispute;
From the centre all round to the sea,
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.
Oh, Solitude ! where are the charms
That sages have seen in thy face 1
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,
Than reign in this horrible place.

II.

I am out of humanity's reach,
I must finish my journey alone,
Never hear the sweet music of speech ;
I start at the sound of my own.
The beasts, that roam over the plain,
0 My form with indifl'erence see;
They are so unacquainted with man,
, Their tameness is shocking to me.

III.

Society, friendship, and love,
Divinely bestow'd upon man,
011, had I the wings ofa dove,
How soon wouldl taste you again!
My sorrows I then might assuage
In the ways of religion and truth,
Might learn from the wisdom of age,
And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth

IV.

Religion! what treasure untold
Resides in that heavenly world !
More precious than silver and gold,

But the toll of the summoning bell
These vallies and rocks never heard,
Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell,
Or smil'd when a Sabbath appear'd.

Ye winds, that have made me your sport,
Convey to this desolate shore
Some cordial endearing report
Of a land I shall visitpo more.
My friends, do they. noiv and then send
A wish or a thought aftejr me 1'

VI.

How fleet is a glance of the mind!
Compar'd with the speed of its flight,
The tempest itself lags behind,
And the swift wing'd arrow of light.
When I think of my own native land,
In a moment I seem to be there;
But, alas! recollection at hand
Soon hurrys me back to despair.

VII.

But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest,

The beast is laid down in his lair,
Ev'n here is a season of rest,

And I to my cabin repair.
There's mercy in every place :

And mercy, encouraging thought?
Gives even nfiliction a grace,

And reconciles man to his lot.1'?!

FAMILY MAXIMS.

turn to it with willingness and pleasure.

GOOD-WILL m FAMILIES.

Better is the lowliest fare where love and
goodwill prevail, than the greatest daintiea
with discord and contention.

ANGRY Pessroxs.
Angry-passions blind the judgment: the;
