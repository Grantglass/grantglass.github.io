THE
MFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
HE that pretends to publish to the worJ4 an ac-
count ol his own life and actions, is doubt-
less under the strongest obligations to confine him-*,
self within the strictest rules oi modesty and truib;
and this, I can assure the'public, I most solemnly
determine in the following narration.
I was born at Y">k h the year 1632 of a repu-
table family My father w«v a me reliant ; born at
Bremen ;his original n*me w;js Kreutzoaer, wl.ich
for rhe fake of the En Iifh pu>niirciaiion was af-
terwards changed into Ciufoe. My mother's name
was Robinson, a native ofthecoumy of York, and
for particular reason I was Called R d/imon, af-
ter her maiden name.
I had three bro.hei*, of which I was the young-
est; the eldest was an officer, and killed in th* war
in the low countries and the others I could never
karn any thing of. My father iatended roe for the
law, therefore-greet caie was taken of my educa-
tion, but to very little purpose; my inclinations
were bent another way, a»d nothing voti&l servt
lay two bat at all bagaids I must go to sea.
( 6 )
My father aud rather were both violently against
it. One morning my father expostulated with toe
v<ry warmly: says he, what rc^f>n have you to
leave your native country, where there mnstbea
more certain prospect of content and happiness, than
to enter iulo a wandering condition of uaeasiuess
aud uncertainty? He recommended to me Augur's
wish, '< Neither to defire adversity nor. riches ;5'—•
that a middle state of life was ihe most happy, and
that the high towering thoughts of raising our con-
dition by wandering a broad were surrounded with
misery and danger, and ofieD ended with confusion
and disappointment; I iutreat you, nay Icoaim iod
you, fays he todeGU from these inclinations; con-
sider your eldest brother, who laid down his life
for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobedience
10 my will. If you will go, added he my pray-
ers mall however be added for your preservation;
but a time may come, whfn desolate, opprest or
forsaken, you may wish you bad lakeD your poor
despised father's counsel! He prosounced these
words with such amoving and paternal eloquence,
while B )ods of tears ran down hi; aged cheeks that
seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But
soon this wore off, and a little after ]informed my
mother, tlut I Could not fettle to my business, my
resolutions were so strong to see the world; and
begged (he would gain my father's consent* only
lo go one voyage, which, if it rfid not prove pros-
perous, I would not attempt a second. But ray
desire was as vain as my folly in slicing-; my mother
pasliongtely exprefs'd, her dislike of this proposal,
telling me, "That /he saw I was beat upon my
own ^itru&roD, contrary to their will and my du-
ty; Æe would fay no more, but lease me to my--
self, to do whatsoever I pleased/1
I was now.about nineteen years of arc, when
rr.eeiing with one of my school' fdlows at Hull,
who was bound to Lor.don with his failiti who w.;s
mast:r of a ship. I acquainted him with nry reso-
lution?, be readily promised me I should have a
free patsage, asd b: provided wit;» dl oihtr neces-
saries fnitn.ble to the ravage; and accordingly
^ without asking any manner of leave, either ot nvy
pareu(s or friend?, upon she fust <f September,
I toidc (hipping for London.
Our (hfp was hardly got char off the Humber,
but we were oTcrtakso by a violent lk-rnv *nd be-
ing extremely sea sick, I begin to reflect upon my
father's good advice, and the bappioef ofa middle
stale of 1 fe whici* he proposed to me, resclvi? g
thai if eirer I should ba so happy as to set my feei
again upOD dry land, I would return lo my parents,
and beg their pardon, and take my leave for ever
of all wamJeiing inclinations,
c These were my though's during the storm; J^fc-
that was no sooner over, bin my repentance vanish;*
ed with the danger; particularly when my com-
panion coming lo me, *sked me if i w^s nota lit-
tle frighted by the Horn, which, r s he expiessed it
was only a cap full of wind.—" And do you, cri-
ed I, caJUuch a violent storm, a cap full of wind?'1
—"'A storm, you fool you, said he, this is no-
thing; a go<d ship, and sea room always biffles
-such a foolish squall o wind-as that: but you are
si fresh water sailor; came, boy, turn cut, see
what fi^e wea'htr we luve now, and a good bowl
of punch wi'l drown all ycur past 1cpow».t>
In, (hnn the punch was made, and 1 getrory
druivk, and then all my former resolutions and no-
Uoas of returning borat^ vaotfbed* I reflSaia*£
fiot headed for several days* until I was roust3 up
by another accident, thai had very near put a final
cod to ray wandering resolutions.
Upon the 6th of September we ca me to anchor
at Yarmouth road, -where we lay windbound with
several other vcfllis from New-caslte, but there
being safe anchorage, awdour sti'p being tight, and
our ropes good, the sailors despised all dangers,
fls)d were as fnmy jo this station* as if they had
been od shore ; but on the eighth day "therefarose'
such a strong gale os wind, that prevented our ri-
ding up the river, which still eucreasiflg, >our ship
rode forecastle in, having (Lipped several large seas
It wa$ not \on^ before a general horror seized
the seamen, and I heard the master cry. " Lord
have mercy upon us, we shall all be l jst " For
my part, I kept my c tbbin very sick, till she dread-,
ful apprehension* of sudden death made me come
upon the deck, and there it was I wv.s indeed most
terribly affrighted,
The fee went mountain h'gh, & nothing was ex-
pected but unavoidab'e destruction. Two of the
ships had already cut their mafls by the board;
two more bad lost their anchor?, and were forced
out to ihe mercy of the tempest, aud we, to five
our lives were forced to cut away both our soiuuast
and main mast.
'Tis easy to judge the condition I was to, who,
being but a ficsb water sailor, w,?s in a far worse
c*se than any of the rest. Our skip was very
(bong, but, as I understood by them too h|avy la-
den, which made the sailors cry out, ''She would'
founder"
The storm continued extremely violent, and in
$hc middle of the night,. I could hear some cry ing
m%t (< That the ship sprung a leak; others,
** Thai there weie five feet of w.*ter in the hold."
I was ready to give up ihe gh^st through fear, when
on a sadden all hands were called to the pump,
and I a no on [j the rest.
While we were all in his confusion and distress
the toaster happened to spy some light colliers, and
fired a gun as a signal of our miseiy. I was not
then a sailor good enough to know the meaning of
the gun; but 1 soon understood it was a token of
our extreme danger, a»d I must fieely own it is
impossible for me to defciibethe agooicsl labour-
ed under.
Happy was ir for us that in t! e storm they re-
garded our sign*!, and with a great deal of hazzard
put out their long boat, and by wonder'ul provi-'
dei ce fav:d oui Iir<s; for with the greatest diffi-
culty, we had hardly got into the boat, when we
saw our sljip fink to the bottom, and had infallibly\ \
been every foul drowned , if they had not come \a
that ver^ nick of lirae to our assistance
'Twas not without a great deal of danger and
difficulty that they recovered their own ship - how-*
ever they made a (h'U to land us at a place called
Comer, near Wioterton light house, from whence,
we all walked in a most miserable arid drowned"
condition to-Yarmouth, where the good people
furnished us with necessaries cither for London or
Hull.
J have often thought since that it'was very strangej,
.tat after these great misfortunes ;ti setting out, I did
wot, like the piodrgal, return to my fat%r, who
fc tving heard of the shin's misfortune,, had all the
reason in the world to conclude I had been lost.
B*t my ril fate still pushed me ou iu spite of all tfee
frong convictions of reason, conscience and experi-
ence.
After three days (Uy at Yarmouth, I met the
youQg man that invited me to go abroad wilb his
lather, I found his face and behaviour very much
altered and I found likewise he had told h s father
who I w^s, and that I had taken this voyage only
for a trial, in order to proceed further abroad
hereafter.
Wbeo ibe old gentleman saw me, fays he,—
*' Y-iung man you ought never attempt to go to sea.
a y more, for depend upon if, you will never be
prosperous in a f-;a fairing cosidition. You fee
-what ill success heaven has set before your eyes,
and perhaps our misfortunes, may in some mea-
sure be owing to you * Pray, adds he, tell me tru-
ly, upon what motives you first undertook this
v ;yagw?" Upon this I told him the whole; at the
cad of which he broke out into the following ex-
clamation.
"O ye eternal powers, what great offence have
I committed, that I should take such a desperate
abandoned wretch iuto my ship that has brought"
all these miseries and misfortunes upon me ?" Alter
his passion was a little abaied he proceeds, *' Youog
man depend upon it, if you do not return and sub-
mit to your parents, wherever you go^ the anger
ol God will certaintly pursue you, and you will
meet with nothing but ruin and disaster, until] your
seiner's words are fulfilled upon you :,; and so be
left me.
And now again I had some notions of returning
home , but these were quickly over ruled by a
fool it'll opinion, that if I did my neighbours and
aojuaiatarace would augh at me. So strange is.
the nature of youth, that though they often do
foolish things without either sliame or remorse, yet
at the fame time they arc ashamtd to own their
folly, and repent.
In {tort, I made the best of my way to London,
being at all hazards resolved upou a royngs; and
being acquainted with 2 captain of a (hip, a voy-
age I soon heard of to the coast of Gur.iea. Hav-
ing some moaey and appearing somewhat like a-
gentleman I did not go on board like a common
sailor, bui soon got so far into the capuin's friend-
ship that he told me I should be his mess mate, and
should have full liberty to carry with me what
merchandize I thought fir, and to dispose of it to
my own advantage
I wag wondenully pleased whh thh kind offer,
and concluied that I had now an opportunity of
making my fortune; and in order to my voyage, I
sent to my frieuds f>r somr* money to fit me out,
who accordingly renvti d me forty pounds, which
I laid Oiit in goods according to his direction; vrht
taught me to keep a journal, and several of tbi
most useful parts of navigation, and indeed, by
hisaffillance aud my own industry in this voyage I
become both a f«tiln and a merchant. Part of the
voyage, I wai excessive sick of a calenture, occa-
sioned by the ex^aorditwry h at of ihe climate, be-
ing latitude o* almost 15 dtgrert nonb of the line;
bowever, I recovered and managtd mv little stock
so well, that I broug! t over wuh me 5 pounds 9
ounnes of gold um, which produced at London
near 300 p»uuds stc<ling
> Soon after my reiur^, my Aood frieactihe cap-
tain died; though ir is was a very great grits to
me, I resolved so go another voyage with b» mats
fliai had got the command of*th$ fame sibip. This
voyage proved aVeiy unsuccessful one. I earned
whh me about one hundred pounds, and left the
rest with the captain's, widow and so sea I went,
But as we w\-re foiling towards the Caaary island
we found we were chafed by a Sallee Rover, who
in spite of all the fail we could make in*'a fhdrt
time came up'with us, and now there w«s no re-
medy but 'o figlxt of be taken, * *
They had %S ^uns mcunjed, and but.ia; <
however, about thiee in the'afternoon -we came 10 „ *
an engagement, "Many" weie kilted on'Jjoib fides,
hut at legmh beirg ovcrpoweied by*nuinbcis, we
were soiced t& submit, aed all caniect jntb„S,alice.
Our men were sent to the Emj erot's co^jt to* be
fold, but the cnplain of the pirates making a partis
cnlar liking to me, kept m<* ft»r his ovo slave.
. * X'was in this rx.ifeuble condition that triy father's -
wvrJs came afresh into my remembrance/ $jj^L my
ihou^his weie coBtii.ually at work to make jnjfjes-
cape. My pan on enttosUd me with the .manage-
ment of his garden and hcufe ; and indeed I was-
Dot without hopes but at some time or otherap cp-*<
portunhy might offci ; the word of it $«is I had nor~
fi)oital to commur.icite my thoughts to, send Jfr*; |j
jwo ye?rs 1 could fi:>d nothirg \ mcucable. l^^t*
i In Jengtb of time I found my paticn was gic^rjL
so poor thai he c^ uld not fit out 1 is ship as uf^t^V *
#nd then ,te used confla'ntly once or twice m^kjx
so go out a fiding* taking me ai^d a IV'frrifcort
po ro*'tI>£ bo$j; ands much pleased was he'
my dtstemy In fishing, that he vouJc) often jf|
„s<ne w'hh a Mocr his kinsman, and a bey to;$4
^ftfor him.
0gp œotni»>g r,$ w$ ?me at sp< rt, thus

rose so thick a fog that we lost out way, and row
ing all uightrvrheR it was light, we fcuad curfelvs
at least two leagues in the ocean : however, we
made a shift to get to shore: a«d to prevent the
like misfortune for the future, our patron ordered
a carpenter to build a little state room in the mid-
dle of the long-boat, with a place behind to tUer,
and other conveniencies to keep^out the weather,
} as also a locker tq put all manner of provisions,
with a b^-dforae shoulder of mutton sail gibbing
ever the cabbio.
I i this he Wi-uid oste^ rake Ivs diversion, and
one iime particularly he invited thiee or f ur per-
sons «.<f distinction to go along with him, arid made
extraordinary preparation for tb ir entertainment;
taking with him three fuzeea, with a sufficient
quantity of po we* er and shot, that they might have
some sport at fowling as they passed along the sh
The pxt morning the boat being in readiness, on a
sudden their tnim s altered. However, my patron
ordered us to ^o catch a distj of fish, for thst he
was resolved his guests should sup with him,
A id now J began to think tf my deliverance,
v lat^rder to this I perfwaded the Moor to get some
'provisions on board, as not daring to meddle with
dpi; patron's ; who taking my advise, we stored
{owscIVefs. with rusk biscuits and thres jars of wa*
\ ter befi les, I privately conveyed into he boat a
boule of brandy, some twine thread, a hammer,
hatchet, and a saw ;in particular some bees-wax,
which was o! great comfort to me, and served t©
juikf candI-8. I then perswaded Maley (for sa
the Moor was called) to procuie sortie powder and
stoat* pretending to kill sea cuvlieus and which ht"
iitfjocently agreed to. And iu (hart being prurid*
ed with all things necessary, we sailed oat resolv-
ing for my own part to attempt my escape though
it fluMild cost me my life.
Whc > we were past the castle, we fell to fishing,
and I stood further into the sea; and when we
were ;;ot ut le st ;i league, I gave the boy the helm
and seizi-.l MaWy by surprise, and threw him over-
board, telling him L never designed him harm, but
thai I must consult the means of my cwn preser-
vation; adding that if he offered lo return, I
would shoot rum through the head ; upon which
he instantly timed about, and swam directly to
the stioie
This action frigihed the poor boy (whose name
was Xuty) exceedingly ; however, i soon eased
bim of bis fear, by telling him if be would be a
good, b ,y aud swear by Mahomet to serve me
faithfully, 1 would be very kind to him : the poor
child seemed to be wonderfully pleased wlH my
promise, and readily consented, and from that
time I began to love him most extremely.
We pursued our voyage, keeping-still oq die
Barbary c all ; but on the dusk of the evening I
changed my course, stcring diiectly S and by E.
that we might be always near the shore ; and hav-
ing a pleasant gale I found the next day* by three
in the afteanooo, we were got 15* miles beyond
the dominions of the Emperor of Morrocco ; yet
still were under dreadful apprehensions of being
re-taken.
I continued failing for five days together, until
I concluded that if any vessel was in pursuit of me
I wat got so far to the southward, that they would
iiot think proper, to follow me aay further.
After all this fatigue I anchored m the mouth of
a little river, but where, I knew not, wehber could
I see any people to make a discovery. Wfeat I
chiefly wanted was fresh water, which I was re-
solved to go od stiore to £od out as soon as it grew
duCkislb: but no sooner it grew dirk, but we heard
such howliugs audydliags of wild beasts aud moo-
sleig, that I must needs own I was exceedingly ter-
1 rified-
PoorX'iry, almost dead with fear, entreated me
not to go ou /bore that night. <£ Supposing I don't
Xury> srJ«l I, and io the morning we should fee
men, who are worse than these we sear, what theb ?'*
Ki O den we may give them d< shoot gu«, replied
Xury laughiug, and de gun make them all ruo a-
way " 1 he w~it and bro!;en English which the boy
had learned among the captives of our nation,
pleased me entirely, and to add to his chccifuj-
IKssjgf £ave n*m 3 dram of the bottle. We could
get but little sleep all the night, sot thrsc terrible
howlings they made; aud indeed we were both
affrighted very much when by ihe rolling of the
water, and other tokens, we justly concluded one
of these moi.sters made tow arch our boat. I could
not fee it till I let fly my fuzee at him. Whether
I hit him or no, I can't tell; but he made towards
the sh«re and the noise of my gun encreased the
stupendious noise of the monsters.
The aext morning I was resolved to go on stiore
togetfsesli WAier, and venture my life amoug beasts
or savages, should either attack me. Xury did
he would take one of the jars, and bring me some.
I aiked why he should go and not I? The poor boy
answered, u If the wild maos come, they eat me,
you go away." A mind scarcely bow to be imita-
ted j so coatt ary to self preserratioD, the most pow-
crsul law of nature! This indeed .increased m7
affections to the child, u well, dear Xury, said
I> we-sliall both, go ashore, boih eat wild nj^ns, and
they stwll eat neither of us.'* So giving Xury a
piece of rusk bread lo eat, and a dram: we waded
a shore, carrying nothing with u> but our arm
and two jars for water.
I did not go out of sight of the boat for fear the
savages should come down the river in their canoe,
and take it away ; but the boy feeing a vale a little
further, ventured lo it, and returning with preci-
patios, I thought h* w/s either pursued by the sa-
vages or some wild bessls; upon which I ran to-
wards him resolving either to perish, or preserve
him : But as he came nearer towaida me, I saw a
creature hanging at his back like one of our .hares,
but forr.eih.ing larger, which proved to be very
good a^d wholesome meat 5 and what added most
to my satisfaction, the boy assured me there was
plenty of excellent water in the creek where the
boat lay.
In thig place I began to consider that the Canary
and Cape de Verd islands could not be far off; but
having no instrument I knew not »n what latitude
we w-jre or when I© stand off to f$t fr them ; my-'
hopes were to meet Tome of the Fnglish trading
veffL'h, that would consequently take us in, and
relieve us.
Tl-c place I was in, was douht'ess, that wtjd un-
inhabited country that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's domiwions and the negroes; it abounds
with wild beasts of all forts, and the Moors keep
it fora place for hunting. From this I 'bought \
saw Mount Teneriff in the Canarit-s, and tried
twice to steer raj coarse &at way, bat a* ofr
ten driven back, and compelled to seek ray fortune
along the coast.
Oat morning very early we came to an anchor
at a imal! point, and the tide begriming to flow,
we were preparing to go further in; but Xury
who it seems saw further than I, desired me to keep
out at sen, or we should be devoured by monsters;
for Look yonder, Meyter," sayi he, in his bro-
ken tone, "and fee dat huge monster dailies a-
«)eep on de si le of de rock Pie pointed at the
place ; and I discovered a lion of prodigious size
basking himself under the (bade of a rock (( Xury ,
said I, you mill go onshore and kill him." But
the boy looked amazed: "Me kill him, says h«,
he eat meat one mouth: ,? meaning one mouth-
ful. Upon which I bid him lie still., and charging
my biggest gun with two slugs, and a good charge
of powjer, I took the best aim I could to have shot
him trough the head, but his leg lying, over his
nose, the slug-broke his knee bone. The lion awak-
ing with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, pir-
ing the most hideous gto.<n I ever heard : but taking
my second piece, I shot him through the head, and
then he J/.y stru'xling for life. Uj>on which Xury
took heart, and desired my leave to go on shore. Go
then, said I, Upon which taking a lfttle-gun in oae
Imid he swam to (hore with the other, and com.
ing close to the lion, put a period to his life, by
(hooting him through tfce head.
But the flesh os t> h savage creature not being
good for food, I concluded this was spending o«r
am nuni ion to no purpose. Indeed I thought the
skin when it wns dry, might be ofsome service j
aod so I determined n flea it off, which took us up
a whole day to effect.. ,?
From thence we went to the southward, resolv-
ing to iiv^ sparingly upon our provisions, and to
go oh flame *i seldom as* possible, my tefign be
to reach C<»rabb, or a~y ether plate about the
Cape de Verb, m hop»;s to meet with some of ihc
ISur&pegso fliipij-and, if pievidence should net sa-
vour me in t:iis*, my aex: resolution w*s to seek for
the jsiaiids/'or veulurc myself among the negroes;
for * without «ue of these,. I could have no other
prospsctt but starving. f
As w€ were5 sailing pretty near the shore* we
could discover several people upon it looking after
us. we coulu perceive they were blackualced
and unarmed *ll, except one. who bad something
la his hand iik; a Kick, wfcicS Xury told*nie was a
laacc, with which they c^xxU kill at a great dis-
tance. I was iucllaed to have game ashore, but
Xury dissuaded me. However/ I drew ujfar to
the shore as 1 cenfm, sud talked to them by fig os,
still I made them seMil>'e j wanted something. They
made si»as again to me to flop my boat, whilst t«ro
cf them Kfnjuto the country, aod ih less than half
an hour, br^tight me two p'rees «f dry fsefh, aod
some corn #hl^b-wa$ exc^eologly welcome to u-;
and at the fogie .tiqjeto prevent our fears, they
laid it-down a^d went and stood at a distance till
we had feiched it toto the boat, a?.d ihea came up
clbfe to us again.
WbUst were preparing to rettfrn our thanks
to the kind negroes for the rood they had brmight
us, we were surprised wish the near approach of
two monstrous crejtf ures3 which we law running
from the ruaumaias in pursuit of each other* they
passed the negroes with great swiftness, undjutnp-
ed-directij imo ths-fesj, -waqtooly swimmtDg abont

as if the eraser had put an end to their fury; at
legdtfa one of them coming neacer the boat t^an I
desired, I took one of toe gu» s and let fly at
and killed him.
I cannot txp.efs the OEsteroaiioa of ihe poor
negroes, upon hearing il^e repoit cf the gun, nor
their surprise at-seeing the creature slain by it I
made figua to ihrm io«baw it out of[the wattr by
a rope, which thsy Accordingly did, and then, I
perceived it w«s a very beautiful leopard, which
m^de me Jksirous of the skin; and the negroes
being no less desirous of the flesh* I freely gare it
tbtitk i as for the othrr, which wai likewise a leo-
pard, tnade back to the mountains with great
swiftness.
The negroes having furnished m with the best
provisions which ihe nature of their countvy, and
circatsiLiiices w^ould allow, I took my leare of
ihem\ audf ta eleven days fail, 1 came in sight of
Cape de? VWd, or thole islands'that go by that
name, but could by no meaos reach, either of
them. Upco which 1 grew extremcl^^r^ecled;
when X'iry, with a fort of terroj^¥rfed4ut>
*' MSliro, Msstro, a great ship i^'aliil.^I
soou pt-rceiveft she was & Portuguese^ and as I con-
jectured bound to Guinea for negroes, upon which
I strove ail that I could to comt up to them ;%iit
all tny striving.had beeo iii vain, if ihe^ bid: no¥
happened to f\y me, and shortened their saiis'to
Hop for rue.;
I£acbur|ged by tMa, I set up my aacietit, and
ffeed a guts iit tekeo of distress, upon which they
kindly Jay by, till I came up whfi them. They
spoke to me in Portuguese, Spaaiih and French,:
jBetlher of these did I uBderflaad; till at lfcgaih*

Scots sailor called, and then I told sum I was a*
English man, who had escaped from the Moors at
Sullec ; upon which they took me kindly on board
with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable j^y
my heart felt at this my happy deliverance, who
from being a late miserable forlorn creature* wai
not only relieved, but in favour wiih the master o f
the stjip, to whom in return for my deliverance, I
offered all 1 had to him; "God fcibid, said he,
that I should take any thing from you: every
thing shall be delivered up to you when you come
to the Biafils ; if I have saved your life, 'thy no-
more than I should expect to receive myself from
any other, when in the same circumstances, if I
should happen to meet the like deliverance: And
should I take from you what you have, and leave
you at Brafils, why t is would be only taking away
a life I have given ; my chanty teaches me better:
those effects you have will support you there, and
provide your pass ge home again. " And indeed he
acted whfehe strictest justice ia what he did, tak-
ing my things into hi? possession, and giving me ao
exact iwventry, even to my earthen jau.
He bought my boat of me, and gave bis note
to pay me 8 pieces of eight for it, when we came to
Brazils . he gave me also 60 for my boy Xuty>

tance ; however, the boy being willing, I agreed
he should be set at liberty after ten yean.
We arrived at the bay of all saint*, after day*
sail. The good man would not take an^ thing for
my p?.ssige. He gave me 29 ducats for the leo-
pard't lkiu, and 40 for the lion's, every thine: ht
caused to be delivered, aud what I would lell h*
bought; ist &ort I made near 2*o pieces of my
small ca»go, aod with this little slock I began, a*
ft were, to enter anew into the world.
He recommended me to an honest planter with
whom I lived in the nature of a servant, till I had
informed myself something in the manner of plant-
ing and making sugar, aod observing the great ad-
vantages of that business I resolved to get the mo-
ji oey I had kfr behind me in England remitted, and
to buy a plantation.
In short, I purchased a plantation adjoining to an
honest Portuguese, born of English parents, whom
upon all occasions, I found a very kind and useful
neighbour. Our flocks at first, were both very
low; nevertheless, by our industry and care, we
made considerable improvements, and began to
grow tich, And now I repented the loss of my
dear boy> Xury, having no mortal to assist me nor
any body to converse with* but my seighbour only*

why could if not as well be obtained in England as
here? when I pondered on this with ferret, the
thoughts of my late deliverance forefook me. I had
none to converse with, but my neighbour; no work
to be done bat by my owo hands, and this made
me of'en fay, roy condition was like of a man thai
cast upon a desolate island. So unhappy are we in
our reflections^ forgetful os what good tbingsw*
receive ourselves, and so unthankful for cur deli-
verance from those calamities that others endure,
I was in some measure settled before the captain
that took me up lest the Brazils. One day I went
to him, and told him what stock I had left to Lond*
aad desierd his assistance in string a remittance

to which the good genus)email replied, he would
have me only sent for half, lest it should miscarry,
and if ii did, the rest would support me; and so
takeu letters of procuration liom me he assured
me he wi u'd seive me to the" ut roost of his power.
Aud indeed wonderful was his kindtiess towatds
me; for he not o<ly precured the money I had
drawn upoa my captain's widow, but sent me over
a servant, with cargo proportionable to my con-
dition. He also lent me over tools of all forts, iron
work, and uieufils necessaiy for rjrjy plantation
and which proved of ibe greatest use to me in my
'business.
Now my wealth began to enercase apace';.and
even in this staus I o)ig'it hate been happy enough

great a power over me. 1 had now lived four years
in the Brazile, and had not only learned the lan-
guage, but contracted an acquaintance with several
of the most eminent merchants at St. Salva-
dor, to whom, by way ot difcouise» giving au
account of my two-voyages tola? coast of Guinea,
asd rHc-maDner of trading there for mere trifles, by
which we might furnish-our plantations with ne-
groes, they gave such attention to what I said, that
three of them came one morning to mc; and told
me they had a secret proposal to make. After en-
joined me to secrecy (it being an infriengemcot cn
the powers of the kistgs of Portugal and Spain)
they told me they had a mind to sit out a shipto go
to Guinea in order to stock the plantation with ne-
groes, which as they could not be publrckly fold,
i.! ey would divide among them; and if I would go
their supercargo in the ship, to manage the tradings

without providing any (lock. The thirg indeed was
fair enough, had I bee a in another condition. But
I, bora to be ray own destroyer,, c u!d not resist the
proposal; but accepted the ufser upon condition of
their looking *fter my plantation. So miking a
will. I bequeathed my effects to my good freiad
the captaiii as my universal heir : hut obliged him
to dispose of my effects as directed, one half os my
> produce to himself, and the other lo be shipped to
EngUnd.
The ship being fined cut, aod all thine s ?n rea-
diness, we set sail the ist of S?pt. 1659. steering

days we had not tailed btfore we were overtaken
by a violent storm, which l isted i2 days successive-

selves I t degrees in the northern latitude upoo

our coarse, sleeting westward, in order to reach
the leeward istaods; and here it was we were over-
taken by a terrible tempast.
Ia this great distress, one of our men cried out,
Land when looking out, that very mo-
ment we found our ship was struck upon the sand;
and expected that we should be all immediately
„ lost. We knew not where we were driveu, and
what was worse, were certain the ship could not
hold out many moments longer.
While we were looking at one another, expect-
ing dcaih every moment, the mate laid hold ef the
boat and with the help t.f the rest got her flung
over the ship's Ode, and-getting all into her, which
Was eleven of us, committed ourselves to God5*
mercy, and the wild sea. And now we saw, that
tbe last effort would not be a sufficient prote&ion
from death: so high did the sea rise, that it was
impossible the boat should live* As to making fail
we had none; neither, if we had could we make
use of any. So that when we rowed, or saltier
were driven about a league and a half, a raging
wave, like a lofty mountaiu came roliog a stern of
us, and took us with such fury, that at once it
overset the boat. Thus being swallowed up in a
moment, we had hardly lime to call upon the tre-
mendous name of God: much less to implore, in
dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy, to receive
our departing fouls.
When men strugling with the pangs ofdeath they
are commonly insensible; but the case was quite
different with me. For though I was overwhelm-
ed with the water, I had the ra ,st dreadful appre-
hensions, and the joys of heaven and the torments
of hell were allternate in my thoughts, aud yet
still I kept driving on, while all my compani-
ons was lost, 'till the wave had spent itself and
retiring had thrown me upon the shore half dead
with the great quantity df water I had taken in
during my struggling; however, I got upon my
feet as fast as I could, lest another wave (h^uld
carry me hack: but notwi'hflanding all the speed
I made, I could not avoid it: for the sea came after
me like a high mountaiu* or furious enemy* so that
my business was to hold my breath and by raising
rnyfelf on the water, preserve ?t by swimming. I
held out as well as possible, till at length the water
having spent itself, began to return, at which I
struck Forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I

took Co my beelt again. Tbiis being feivsd twio*

recovering a Hiile before the refu*a of tire oext

wave l^id abated, and then I made stiift to reaeh

I hoped so have got the boat, but the water be*-
tweeo that and the shore, rendered it impractica-

^ to get -something from thence for my present sub-

At all hazards' I resolved to go to the (kip, so
stripping off my coat and (hoes, leaped iuto tbe
water, aud swimming tohei, I had the good for-
tune to fyy a rope hanging so low down that I
could teach ft, by the help of which with some dis-
fi<-ul<y, I got iiuo the forecastle. Here I sound
that the ship was bulged, her stern lifted up against
the bank, and her h?ad almost io vhe water ;all
her quarter, and what was there was free and dry,
the provisions I found in good order, with which |
crammed my pockets ; and losing no ticne eat while
I was doiug other things, I also sound some rum,
r>s which I took a hearty dram ; and now I wanted
far nothing except a boat, to carry what wa3 need-
ful for me.
Necessity which is the mother of invention, put
a project into my head. There were on board se-
veral spare y*rds, a spare top mast or two, Aud
three large (pars os wood ;with these I fell to
work, flinging as mauy of them overboard as I
could manage, and tied them together that they
mi jht not drive away; when this was done, I tkd

found the raft to drive a YniU (iistance from fW

which 1'brought away the carptaut^ stqr%

I only fouud a wild cat sitting 00 one t» e chests,

When I ha«I landed the second cargo, I fell im-
mediately to work to make me a little tent, and
^Fortifie I it in the best manner 1 could, to sscure
 myself a? much 28 possible against any sudden at-

fred my fire arm*, blocking up the doors, and laid
the bed I had brought from the {Lip upon the
ground, and slept as comfortably as though I ha 1
been in rov native country.
But still the thoughts of cny future fubstfe&ee
and preservation were uppermost in my mind, aud
so long as the fb'p remained in that condition, I
daily brought away one accessary or other; parti-
curly the ringing, fails and cordage ; i( mt twine,
a baircl of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of
meal, three ca of rum ; and what indeed was
tnost welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.

I cuufi&ted tlrat the grairnd where I wtfs in*

rai ned to find out a place more healthful arid cor-
veniest; aad to my great comfort and satisfaction*
I soon found o-ie that answered my ex< e£Ution.
The place wa* si little pl.Jn near a riling hill;
the front being as steep as tbr fide of a house.—
On the side of this rock was a IhtJe hollow place,
resembling ih* entrance of a cave; jutf b<fo?e tt h

was a hundred yards broad and twice as lcrg,
with a pleasant descent every way to the sr j si;*.
After this I drew a semi circle, con aiisi ig b ut
twenty yard3 in the diameter; and when tlut
done, I drove down a row ol stakt s noi above Jwx
inches from each other: and by the help t scabies
which I had brought from the ship, and luj~h other
materials I ma ie use cs, I made a f< rt ol r*gukr
fonific^iion, which I concluded was i>> a g cat
measure impregnable against arysud^Ci* attemp
either of fcvjges or wild beasts, and for my bet-
ter securely I would have no doors, bin tome out
and in by the heljj of a le«dder, which I nu^c for
that purpose. %\

I found a tree, the wood of which was very hard
and out of thai, with the greatest difficulty, I made
me a foitof a sp«»de ; in doing of it, I almost spoil-
led my axe, which might be of ill consequence.
Nov. 23. When I had got my fools into the
best order, I could, I spent ail my time to the loth
of December in finishing my cave and lay in my
tent every night unless the weather was so wet that
I could not lie dry ; and withal had so well thatch-
eil it over with staggers, the leaves of trets, &c»
that.I thought myself tolerably secure.

some goats, fLut oae of them, and lamed another

sc-ucVl fiU.ul great numbers of fowl much like

Whilst I w*s rummaging among my moveiblts,
what should rnll into my hautfs but a b g, which I
fUj> >• fe might be made use of to hold cm for the
fowls in the &ip. I purposed to mak* use of it to

the least suspecting- th* coosequ-nce. T.^e rain
bad fdlen in a great quantity a Jay or two before 5
and the moMh after, to iuy*rcat surprise, T dis-
cr,Vi red something spring up very green andflm-
rifhiug, and its I came daily to view ii, I saw several
eais of g»etn barley, os the versy s«me size.and
shape ot thole in England. ,:%
My thought! were very much confused ar ikis
-unexpected sight} and I must Win I bad i be r»hh$i

to imagine that providence bad ordered ibis oa
purpose for »y subftstaoce : great were my acknow-
ledgements and thankfulness to Almighty Ged, sot
his mercies to me in this desolate place ; which were
infinitely heightened, when at the same time I ob-
served some rice stalks wonderfully «re*o and flou-
rishing, which made me conclude there must con-
sequently be more corn in the island, aed accotd—
ingly, I spent several days in searching the rocks;
when at length it came into my mind thai I bad
Shaken the bag in the very spot where those blade
os corn were growing.
It was about the latter end of June, before these
cais of c )rn grew ripe, and then I laid them up
exceedingly careful* expectifig I should one day*
reap the advantage of this little crop, whJc* I useci
all my industry to imprrw* i and yet it wa< 4 years
before I could eat any barley bread, and much lon-
ger before I had any benefit from my rice. Af-^
ter this, with indefatigable care aod industry, £
finished my wall, oidering it so, that I bad no
ways to go into my fortress but by a ladder.
April 16. I finished my ladder, and ascended'
it: after pulling it up, then let it down on the ia«
sidc, and descended into my n#w habitation, where*
I had space enough, aud so fart/fie^, that nothing
could attack me without scaling the wails.
But what does all human paias and industry a-
vail, if the blessings of God do no^ crown «ur la-
bours ? Or, who can stand befote the Almighty,
when he stretebeth forth his arm ? £ai one ti^e as
I wat at the entrance of my cave, tber; happned
such a rerriblc earthquake, that cot uply the roof
cf the cave cam': tumbling about my ears* feui th«
posts seemed to ci*ek urribly at the faae time^
This made mt in great amazement run to my lad-
der, «oei get over ifot wall; when I then plainly
knew it was an earthquake, the place I stood on
sustaining three terrible (Locks in Uk than three
minutes. And when I f*vr the top of a great rock
roll into the (t«, then I expected the island would
he swallowed up every inorae»t; and dnwdful it
wisto see the sea thrown into the most violent
agitations and disorders by this tremendious acci-
dent.
For way part I stood lik« a crimiaal at the place
mi execution, ready lo expire. At the moving of
the earth, I was, as it were sea sick; and very
much afraid left the rock, under which was my
fence and habitation, should overwhelm me and it
ID a lasting tomb.
When the rhird dreadful (hock had spent itself,
my spirits began to revive; yet still I would not
venture to ascend the ladder, but continued fitting,
not knowing what I should do. So little grace
thea ha 1 I only ;o say, Lord have mercy upon me!
and no sooner was the earthquake over, but that
pathetic pray«r leit me«
It was not long aher when a terrible tempest a-
rose, at the feme time attended with a hurricane
of wind ; the-sea seemed mountain high, and the
waves rolled'so impetuously, that nothing could
be^perecived out froth aacl foam, Three hours did
ihis storm continue* aud in so violent a manner,
as to tenr the very trees'by their roots, which was
succeeded by abuoefcapee; of rain' When this was
over, I went to my t*tft> but the rain coming again
upou me in a furious manner, obliged rae to take
shelter in the cav»; and then I was forced to cut
a channel thro* my fortification to la the water
•ut It continued raining all that night; and some
time the n*xt imy ;*yct no sooner did the weather
clear up, but I rtsolred to build me a little hut in
some o;.ta place, walltd round to defend me from
the wild cieatures and savages, as not thioking
but at the next earthquake, the mountain would
fall upon my habitation and me, swullaw up all in
its bowels,
Afml, 2j| 30. Were spent in contriving how
and in what naapner, I should fix my new abede;
and here 1 was under the greatest concern, having
no tools fitting For such ao uaderfaking; however,
I spent several days in whetting and grinding my
tools.
,May 1. As I was w*lkipg along the sea side,
I louod a barrel of gunpowder, and divers other
pieces of the ship, wbicb the violence of the late
florin bad tkrown 00 the sand. I saw likewise the
remaining part os the ship thrown up by tbe tem-
pest, very near the shore, resolved to get to her
at I could , but at that time I found it ioapractica-
Ue.
I continued to work upon the wreck till the
34th, aud ewy day recovered something that
would be of service 10 me, and got together so
many planks,and so much iron, lead, and other ne-
cessaries, that had I tools and skill, I might have
built me a beat, which I wanted extreoily.
Junk 16. As I was strolling towards the sea,
I found a large turtle: the 17 1 spent in cooking
it: I found in ber threescore and ten eggs, arc! the
flesli was tke most delicious meat that I ever tasted.
The 19 I flayed within the whole day, there be-
ing a continual rain, with florist of wind aad
lightning.
From the l^tb to the 34 h I was jvery sick, and
!iad get a terrible ague, which osteal hvlu me for 9
Or 10 noun, with extreme violenct'.
June 15th. All this ilay I w**j afflicted with
an ague; thirsty, yet could net hel$ myself to wa-
ter; prayed to God in these words', Lord in pity
look upon nie, Lord have raercy t/ipon aae, have
mercy upon me! after this Ifcll Jst«ep, which I
found had much refreshed me; wJi*<u I a waked I
fell astesp a second time, aod sell rnto this strange
aed terrible fort of dream-
Me liieught I w*c sitting on the s*me (pot ©f
ground, at the outside of the wall, wfeere I saw
when the florm blew after tbe Earthquake-, and
that I saw a man descending from a great black
cloud, and light upon the ground. He was al) o*er
bright as 1 flame «f fire thai a little before surround-
ed him; his counteGa^ce inconceivably terrible;
the earth ;s it were trerablad whto he slept upon
the ground,audflasties of fir^ feemtd t-i still the air.
No sooner I thought him landed ujon ti e earth*
but with a long spear or other weapon, he made
towards me : but first ascending * rising grouiuf,
his voice added to my amazemeut, whajj I st ought
I heard him pronouoee these dreadful words, Un-
happy wretch I feeing ail these things have not
brought thee to repectmee, thou (hall tmmediatt-
ly die. In pronouncing this dreadful sentence, I
thought he went to kill me w»tb the spear that was
in b'S haod,
A y body may think it impossible for me to ex-
pref he horu r; <>f my mind at this vision; and
even wh-n I .wake 1, this very dream made a
d v y impr.m n upo» my mind. Tb* Iiiih> clivifie
kuuvveledge 1 wad, I retired siow my father's m-
ft ructions, and that was worn ou? by an uninter-
rupted scries of the set-fairing impiety for tight
years space Kxc*pt what sickness forced from rat,
I don't remember I had one thought of lifting my
heart up lowrtids God; but rather had a certain
stupidity of sou*, not having the least fence of fear
of ihe Omuip./tent being when in distress, nor of
graitude to ham for his deliverances. Nay, when
I was on ih* defpen.te expediti^ on the desart
Alrif*u sh«>rce I can't rtmernber I had otac thought
of what would become of œe, or to beg h»s confo»
lation jind aflistance in my sufferings and distress;
When the pciiug.d captain took me up, and ho*
aourabiy used mi, nty further, when I was even
delivered fr<ioa drawing by escaping to this ista< d>
I Mvtr looked uj>orj it as ^judgment, but odI/
said, I wat« an uofonuaatedog, and that's all. In-
deed fame (eoti traofpoit cf foul I had, which
"were not trough grace, bui only a common.fligh|
of joy, that I was ?et alive, when my cnmpa^Uns.
were all drowned!: and no other j.»y could I con-
ceive but what is common with the sailors over *
bo>fl of punch, after they escaped the greatest
dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor
cooveviienqh s might have cu'led on me foi a tnank^
sul acknowledgment to Providence. Indeed the
growth ef my corn touched me with some {ewee,
but that soon wore off again \ The terrible earth-
quakes poirusd to me as it were the finger of GJSk&«
but my dreadful amazimeOt continued no lon^^
than ij&duratita. But now when raj- spirit* begaj^r
lo sinrfcluauer the burthen of a strong distempers
and I coulrl leisurely view the miseries of death pre-.
seat use If before my eyes 5 then my awaked cos-

science began to reproach me with my past Its**
m which I had so wickedly provoked the jutice
of God to pour down his veRgeanœ upon tac.
Such reflections a* these oppressed me tvea in
the violence of my distemper ; somt prayers I ut-
tered, which only proceeded from my fear of death.
But when I conuiered my father's advice and pro-
phecy, I could not forbear weeping; for he told
me, that if I did persist iu my lolly I should not
only be deprived of God s bltsstr g, but have time
enough to reflect upon my dtspiGng hii instructions;
and this in a wrttehed time, when none could help
me. And now concluding it to be fulfilled; hav-
ing no foul io the island to administer aDy comfort
to me, I prayed howtrtr earnestly to the Lori, that
he would help me in this «y great calamity. And
this, I think, was the first time I prayed io siice-
lity for many years. But now I must teturn to my
Journal.
Jon* st, I slept pretty well most part of the
night, which refreshed me very much: in the morn-
ing I eat a biilut, and drank some water roixt with
rum: I boiled a piece of goat's flesh for my dinner,
but I eat very little, and at night I supped upon
three of my turtles eggs; after supper J attempted
to walk out with my gon, but found myself too
weak, and so returned to my habitation.
Here conscience flew in my face,reprebendmg me
as a blasphemer and reprobate for sayisg ia my a-
gooies, What have I done to be distingufbed in all
this feeae of misery? Methought I heard a voice
aosweriag to me, ungrateful wretch, dare you ask
what have you done? Look upon your pail life,
and then alk thyself wby thou wast not drowned in
Yarmouth road or killed by the Sallcc rovers J
w hy not devoured by wild beads in the deserts of
Africa, or drowned here with the rest of thy com-
panions?
Struck dumb by these severe rtflictions, and fear-
ing the return of my ague, I began at length to
consider what was 'he moll pioper to be done, to
free myself Irom ihts distemper, anJ having beard
that the Castilians use tobacco for most of their dis-
eases, I was resolved to try the experiment.
I tried several ways with the tobacco, first took
a leaf and che which made me very sick and
almost stupisi-d me; next I steeped it in rum, re-
solving to t4kc a dose of it when I went to bed,
and ttaa, I put some icto a pan, anil burned it,
holding my nose over the smeke as long as I
could endure it without suffocation, After these
several operations I fell into 2 sweat, and slept
quietly md well for 15 or 14 hour*, and when I
get up in the mon.ing I fouad my spirit, rtrived*
my stomach muck better and I gr?w exceeding
hungry, w»ic'- I had not been for some tier c past,
in short, 1 passed my sit the next time and f. uud
that I everyday ^rsw iltonger and better.
The 30th, 1 v-ctured out with my gin, and Jol-
leds a fowl net much unlike a brand ^orse, but Mid
ntt eat as the fl sh, chusing rat:.er 10 dine upcm
two or three more of my turtle's eggs. In the
evening I re neve 1 my medreioe, o:t withstanding
which I h id a ii;t'e fpic** of sit th? nexi day ^na
therefore on tie 2J of july I took tny medict&fe <
as I 4rd at the'first'; and on the 41 h» which iras
the iay in wh'ch I expected the r«i&ro of my fits*
the <tgus left nae, which was'no small joy to me 5
and indeed the goodness #f God on this occasion,
affected me so seacibly, that I fell on siy knees* and
fetarncd thanks in the most devout and solemn
manner.
july 4. I walked out wiih my gun but my dis
order reduced me so low I could go but a little
v'**y at a lime; tor the experiment weakened me
exceedingly. I had now been io this island about
ten months, aud all the while had noi (cm man or
Woman; and so growing better, I began to think
myself sole monarch of the isle, and resolved to
make a tour about it, in order to view the extent of
my dominions! and to make what discoveries I
could-
The 13th I bagKO my journey, and among ether
things 1 foimd a little brook ol running water, on
the bunks of which were several pleasant meadows
Covered with grafs ; on the rising parts, where I
supposed the water Hi not reach, I perceived se-
veral pleasant stalks of tobacco, and »ther plants
I knew nothing as: among the rest I found some
sugar wees,- andsereral plants of aloe wands wiih
these discoveries I returned well satisfied to my lit-
tle oastle, and slept that night very comfortably.
The next day g«ing the fame way, and further
than before I found the country lull of wood,
and extremely pleasant and delightful. The me-
lons lay on the ground in great quantities, znd
groat clustres of grapes hungamongihe tiees ; and
th%ugh I was mighty glad of this discovery, yet I
ear very sparingly, of them, for fear of putting my-
self •ither into « flux or a fever.
fne night eombg on, I climed up into,a tn»e,
and having fixed myself us secure as possible, slept
very coraforub!y though it was the first time I had
ever Uin out of ray habitation: wben ih* m orning
came I proceeded with the greatest pleasure about
four miles further, *nd at r e end of this valFey 1
f«uod a fi*« spring of excellent wafer, and the
Country all rou ;d the must beautiful ) ever saw:
and now I was resolved to lay up*s much fruit as
possible
Jolt 19, Having prepared two bags, T re-
turned thither ia order o bring home 10 my
castle as much of th* several forts of f;uiis as I
coul J, that I might have a steck by oseagiinst I
sliould waotit; and now I b g*n to rtfbct that
this i>art <*f the istand was infinitely the best to in-
habit ia, but <h^n 1 thought at t!.e fame tin'e, that
if I removed from my present place of abode, I
should lose the prospect of the sea and so, if pro-
vidence stbouhi order a ship on that coast, I shouJd
Issc nil peffib I ty of deliverance t however, the
|jlace was so delightful, 1 reiolv.d to build me &
sort of a tastuefs, or rather a country feat there*
•which took au up the remainder ot the month of
July.
Here it w s I dress, d up my grape> which I af-
terwards carried to my old habitation, lor a winter
supply. About the I4*h of August the rain began
to fall with great violence ici> made me judge
it prorer to retire to my castle 'or shelter, The
rain continued to fall more 01 less till the middle
of October, and sometimes with that violence that
for several days I could not stir out of my cave,
till I was constrained to it by the pure want of
food, I went cut twice, the first time I shot a
giat, and the second I found a turtle, as large-
«§6 the former.
September 30. Casting up the notches ob
the post, I found they amounted to 3-654 I con-
cluded this to be the aonivetfary of my landing*
b %
And after I had returned thanks for my wonderful
preservation in this desolate island, I went to my
bed and slept very coutcntedly.
Before I proceed further in my journal, I must
take the liberty to put tfee reader in mind of the
barley and rice , I had kvei about 3* stalks of the
former, and 2o of the Utter; and concluded the
season to be proper, I dug up some gr«uad with
my wooden spade and sowed it, which at the pro-
per time grew up and answered my expectations.
The wet weather was no sooner gone, but t»y
inclinations led me again to the bower I bad built
on the other Gde of the island, which I found whole
and intire as I had left it, and the s;*lks all grow-
ing much after the nature of our willows, which in
time made me a noble feuce, which I shall have oc-
casion to speak of more particularly hereafter.
And now I conceived that the seasons of the
year might be devidtd iDto wet and dry, and not
into Summer and Winter as in Europe, as thui:

And as the winds continued to blow, the wet
season would continue either longer or fbotttr;
and aster I bad made t:eie and the like observa-
tions, I always took care to provide accessaries,
that I mig ht stay wirbia during the wetness of the
weather, and in that time I took cate to make such
tool6 as I wanted.
The first thing I attempted was to make me «
basket, which after much labour, and difficulty I
effected ; but the two things I most wanted- were
utterly out of my power, viz some casks to hold
my liquors, anJ small pots to boil and tiew my
meat, and also a tobacco pipe, fur which I at last
found out a remedy.
After the weather grew fair, my further reso-
lution of viewing the whole island took place; and
accordingly taking my dog and gun^and other ne-
cessaries proper, I set forward, aod having passed
the vale where my bower stood I came within
si *ht of the sea, lying to »be W. and when it was
a clear day I could discover land, but could not
tell whether it was an island or the continent %
Bcither could I tell what place this might be ; on-
ly I thought it w»s Americaj and consequently
fthat part of the country which lies between the
Spanish territories and Brnsiis, which abound wilh
Cannibals who «evous human kind.
In vUwing this part of the island* I found it was
much more pleasant 8c fruitful than wrere I had
pitched my tent. Here were great numbers of
parrots, 8c with great difficulty I got one of them,
which I carried home with me, but it was a gteat
-while before I could tame it and bring h to speaks
even as much as to call me by my name. In the
low grounds I found great aujuubcti of bar:* aad
foxes, and abundance of fowls of different kinds,
with great quantities ofgrapcs, and other excellent
-fruit. In thh expedition I dt 1 not travel above two
milts a day, being d*sir*u8 to make what discove-
ries I could ; and when I came to the sea /Lore, I
Was amazed to fee it look so exceeding beautiful 8c
so full es•xccllent fisli: but though tbi« journey, I
must confess, was very delightful to me, yet still
my secret inclination led me to my old habitation,
so after I had set up a sort of a land mark for my
guile for the future, I concluded to return by a
d/ffiartrit way than that I came ; and as I w«s mak-
ing tbt best of my way, my dog happened to (ur.
prize a kid, which I rescued from him, and led
borne in orjer to try if I could raise a breed, which
at some time or other, I was satisfied, woulJ be
of some use to me.
After I had been about a month upon this expe-
dition, I returned to my little castle, and repoled
myself with great pleasure iu my hammock, and
Indeed eonlinaed a week within to rest and refresh
«nysels; and now I began to think of the kid I had
lest bthiod me In the bower, and resolved imme-
diately to fetch it home. When I came there, I
found it almost starved ; I ga?e it some meat, poor
creature, in gratitude for its deliverauce it
followed me, as naturally as my dog, quite home
to my custle, which I afterwards kept as one of my
domestics.
Tie wet season being come, I kept myself with*
in ; and upon the $oth of September, it being the
third ytar of my abfde in the Island, I paid my so-
lemn ackoowledgemcnts to Almighty God for my
preservation, and entcftained myself with a world
of reflectfons upon my present and former eondi-
tlon j aad as I was ooc moraipg sadly pondering
upon my prescat state, 1 happened to open my
bible, when the following words occurred : "I
will never leave, nor forsake thee;'' 'which I pre-
sently took as directed to myself, and 1 must owa
the expression gave me a great deal of secret satis-
faction.
The beginning of this year I fixed my daily
employmenti as follows, the morniag I spent ia
my devotion, and paying my duty to God ; after
I hii done that, I went out with my gun to seek
provisiois; whic h after I bad got, toek me up some
time in dressing and coaking. In the middle of
the day I was forced to lie by, by reason of the ex-
cessife heats, and the rest of ihe time I spent in
making and contriving such necessaries as I stood
most iu need of.
But now the time for my little harvest coming
on, I had the desirable prospect of a good crop:
bat my hopes were greatly disappointed by she
goats and hares, who having tasted the sweetness
of my corn, bad eropped it so close, that it had
not stiength to stioot up into a stalk: to prevent
this, I was forced to make a hedge tound it but I
hid no sooner done thii than I was infested with
vermin of another species. My back wai no sooner
turned, but a stock of birds Game atd destioyed
what the otheis had left; I let fly upon these, aod
killed three of them, which I huag up H6 a terror
to the rest upoa stakes, which project had so good
an effect, that they a«t ooly forsook the corn, but
that part os the island forever afterwards.
My corn growing ripe, antf harvest coining* ont
I cut it down, aod carrfcd home the eats ; aod as*
icr I had rubbed them aud threslied them in the
best sunner I could; tfee prodace of the barley, &s
learasl could conjecture, was about two bushels
and 3ia Sialf, ar.?d (hat of the rice much about the
si ok quami'y ; and now I plainly saw by the pro-
vidence of God, I should be supplied with corn,
though at the same time, I wanted all manner of
necessaries for making it into bread, which with
the greatest labour and difficulty, I afterwards sup-
plied.
My t ed being e creased, my next care was to
prepare n»f>re land to sow it in ; and accordingly
fixed upon two large plots upoa 'be backside of my
castle, which I prepared with infinite pains, and
put h into the ground & after made a hedge rouud
it to dtfend it from vermin.
I . short, ray corn encreased to that degree, that
I thought I might Dow venture to eat some of it
but bow to make it into bread, was still the diffi-
culty ; and yet even this I found rruaus to sur-
mount at last and so, as io all other emergencies, I
found a remedy beyond my expectations.
After I had procured every thing needful for
making my bread, which you may imagine was no
small satisfaction, the prospect of land which I had
seen on the other side of the water came frefb into
my raiud ; but how I should come at it I was won-
derfully at a loss. I tried to recover the (Lip's
boat, and then make a Canoe, but all in vain;
and here I could not forbear reflecting upon the fol-
ly of those that undertake matters they are not at-
tic to go through with.
I was in the middle of my projects when my
fourth year expired, since I had been cast on the
island ; nor did I forget to keep my anniversary
with that solemnity and devotion as I had done the
year, before j I bcg*a to thiak myself separate from
the world, and from all opportunities of humao
conversation. I oow had nothing to covet, being
as it were an eaaperor, or king of a whole country
vrbere 1 had nobody to eonlroul me, nor nobody to
to govern but myself.
Tiuse thoughts made me look upon the
things of this world with a religious contempt, and
rendered me easy in my isolate and melancholy
•ondilion ; for having roa«ie God's mercies to me
matters *\ the highest consolation. I relinquished
all peasire thoughts, and dismal appi«h<:osion5> and
resigned myself cetirdy to God's providence
My drink was quite gone, and my biscuit almost
exhausted: my linen was worn out, only some of
the failori cVrcj tiered fhfits remais'd, which were
erf mighty use to me in the hot weather. My
cloathes and ha! were quite worn, but those I sup-
plied by the help«*f my goat ikiis, of which I first
made me a fort of a cap, and then a waistcoat and
Open kneed breeches, with the hair on the outside:
and ibus being perfectly at ease in my mind, I spent
my time in coniemplating the blessings of Heaven,
and wa* ravished to think, that at one time or other
I should be delivered from my present mislotunes,
and placed out of the reach of them forever.
For five years afor this nothing worth mention-
ing happened ; only at spare times I had finished at
small canoe, with which at all hazards, I resolv-
ed to try the circumfeience of my dominions ; ia
order to it, I put provisions on board, with am-
munitions, and other necessaries, fit for the expe-
dition.
It was the 16th of November, in the 9th year
of ray reign, that I began this voyage ; wtoich was
much longtr than * expected hy rcasea I had ma-
my difficulties to encounter I did not expect ; and
indeed the rock was so high aud ran to far i to the
sea, that I often resolved to turn back, father than
run the risk oi behig drivejj so far out to sea, lb*t
I could by do means get back again.
In this confusion I wmc to an anchor a* nea* the
shore as possible, to which I wad«d, and clamber-
ing up to the top of an high hill, I viewed th« ex-
tent of my dominion*, ai;d at all hszards resolved
to pursue my voyage, It is endles* to relate what
dangers my rafh&els exposed me to. I wa* driven
by the cumiat so far into tSe sea, that I had h.ndly
any prospect to get b*ck *g,jn ; not by all I could
do witfa the paddles, which I made to supply the
place of skulls, to help me, and now I had no pt ef-
fect bus perishing in the sea, when my provisions
were spent, or befjre, if a llo'tn should arise.
However, by ihs lucky change os the wind, or ra-
ther by the particular providence of God; I was
drives back again to the island, and to my unspeak-
able joy, I came on shore, where being exceedingly
fatigued with watching and hard labour, I laid me
down and took a little repose. Afttr I ha 1 awak-
ed and had diess*d myself up as usual, I laid up
roy'boat in a small convenient creek, fit for that
purpose and taking my gun, $cc. 1 made the best
of my way towards my Ucr/er, where I again laid
roe down to rest, bui it wat not long before I was
surprized wbh a voice, which called," Robinsoa
Cruso* , poor Robinson Crusoe, where have you
been poor Robinsoo Crusoe ?" Upon which I start-
ed up in great confusion, & castingmy eyes round,
I saw my parrot sitting upon a hedge, and then I
knew it was (he that called to me ; but was strange-
ly surprised h©w the creature could come theic,
an] why h shoaU fix upoa that place above the rest,
the; bird came to me as soon as I called it, aod
perched upon my thumb as usual, and seemed to
signify a great deal o! joy for my return.
This voyage had cured me of a great deal of my
ra nbling inclination ; insomuch th.a i began to by
asi le all hopes of delivetanc ; so I led a retired
life, and in a very contented manner, passed away
Dear twelve raoiths, spending tr.y lime in making
inss u lie us, and doing such things that I found
were most a^fJuiely necessary, both for my pre-
fers and I mure subsistence.
My next confi leiaiion was, ray powder growing
short ; what I should do to kill goats and lowl ic#
live upon. I had abundance of contrivances in my
head to try to cn*ch the goats alive, particularly the
she goats with young, and at legnth I had my de-
sire; for making pinsaJls, and bathing them with
some of my com, one morning I found io one of
them an old he goat, and in *he other three young
ones, viz. a male and two females ; the old one
was too strong for me, and I couid not tell how to
master him, but the youDgones I made {his: to get
borne to my c^ve : it was some time before I could
make them feed ; but ast*r they had been kept with-
out so•»!, and I threw them some lreih coin, and
gave them so sue water, ihclr stomachs esme to
them ; and now my next care was to find them pas-
ture, and secure them so tb*t th<-y might not run
away; all wish which abundance of pains ?.nd dif-
ficulty, I at last effected, and withal, by my good
uGge of these poor creature?, had made them |b
tame and familiar, thai they would follow me »ifd
eat my corn out of my hand ; this having answer-
ed my eads to all inteuts and purposes I think in
atrout a year and a halPt time I had got a slock of
about ei, and in lest ihao two y*ars 45 ; and now
I was »ot only well provided wiih goal's fL-ft, but
with miik too, which was another bleQiog I had
lit le reason to «xp»ct.
Being ebus happy, and haviDg almost forgot all
hopes oi liberty, I lived a* well at the nature of
my condition could possibly allow, and indeed it
was a very diverting sight 10 fee me fit iu slat* at
my dinner, all alone by nyfelf like a king; and it
would have been a very pleasant bject to have
seea me in my joat-skiu dress, aud other suitable
habiliaments
M.y chhi concern now va< about my boat?hav-
ing cost me so much haid labour, I resolved one
time *o go along ibe store by land to her ; but had
any one in England met such a figure, it wculd
either affright theoi, or make them burst into laugh-
ter : nay, I myself could not help srnihVg at my
habit, which I thiuk in ibi§ place is verj^roper to
describe.
The cap I had upon my head wr,s great, high
and slnpelese, made of a goat skin, with a fl^p or
pea: house hanging down behind, not only to keep
the su .- rom me, aut to stioot the rain from off my
neck, nothing bc'i^g more perorciout than the rain
falling u. on the fi sh in these climates. I h.'.d a
short jacket »s goal's kin, the ;kirts comijsg down
about the middle of my thigs; but my bretches
were o'. eo kr.eed, mad- of a vuy old he goat (Via
whose hair h*v>g down such a length on eithtr fi 'e,
that it reached down t* the calve* of my legs. As
for shoes and slockin/s I had nsne, but made me a
resemblance of somethings I kaow not what call
them;they were made like buskin*, and lacedoa
the side like spatter dsslra, barbarously [taped like
the rcU vs my h&bi; J bad ua me a broad bell of
go a* «ki* Writ i, git i round with a couple of thongs
intl?,,* ot buckles ;o.i e**h si,k oswhich, lo sup-
ply ih- deficiency of a i^ord aed daggtr, bung ray
hitthtt ana* Lw. I h,*d another belt ect sj broad,
yet fastened in the sarju* manner, which bung over
my sliouider ; and at ihe end of if, under my left
arm, wcie two pouahas, made also of goat-akin*
to bold my powder and (Lot. My basket I carried
on my back, and my gun on my (houHer, and over
my head a great clumsy umbrella, which howe-
ver, next my gun wat tbe mrst necessary tbingabaut
me. At for my s*ce? the colour was nut really so
swarthy at a molatto'a, or might be expected from
such a parson a« I, who took io little care of it, in
a climate wilhia 9 or 10 decrees of ibe equator.
At one time mv beara1 grew so long that i hung
down abave t quarter of a yard ; but as I bad both
niors and stiffens in store, I cut all off, and fuf-
ferid none to grow except a large pair es Maho-
metan whitkers, the like of whiab I bad seea worn
by some Turla at Sallee, not strong enough indeed
to bang a bat upon; but of such a monstrous size as
woufti have aenaatd any in England to have seen.
Bus all this was of no consequence here, there
being neme to obsetve my behaviour or habit. And
so went by the reute intended to the place where I
lest the boat, but fouad that ther« was no way to
bring it off without running the fame risque I was
so lately expaied to which I thought too.dange-
rous for a second experiment, and therefore I tc-
solrcd upon aeothec expedient, which waa ta make
another canoe, and l&avc it on the ether side ©f tbe
river.
And here I think it may eot be improper to in-
form ihe reader, that 1 had two plant* tioui in the
isUud ;thc first was my little son or castle, where
I had mad* feveal improvements; and the second
was my bower or country feu, whert my grapes,
and the enclosures for my goats, and several other
cobvenieocie;, mads it a v.iy pleasant and agreea-
ble retirement.
From this place it was that I used to go often lo
view my boats ; and now I /ball relate a thing that
gave me the most disquiet of any thi»g I hid tree
met with since my first comiag into the island.
It may be welJ supposed, that aster I h*4 been
soloDg in this desolate part of t e world, nothing
could have been more surpuzi g than to have se*a
any human creature ; but one ay as 1 was going
to my boat as usual, 1 perceived on the land the
print of a man's naked foot, and had I seen an ap-
parition I could not have been m&re terrified. I
Jooked round me on al sidts, but could aot hear or
fee any thing ; I observed the ttampliiigs, and w^s
convinced lrom all the signs that some foot liad
been there, and in the deepest confusion I r«turn-
ed back to my habitation.
That night 1 never closed my ey<8, and was full
of ihe most dilmal apprehensions that I was ever l»
all my life. Sometimes I had the vanity to think it
must b; the devil, at other times thought ii ra-
ther lome savage that the curreut bad drive > in,
and not liking the phee, was secretly gont oft to
sea again* Happy was I in my thougfcts that none
of the savages had seen me nod y$t, at the same
lime, I was exceedingly terrified Ust thty (h uld
have seen my boat, and so come in great cumbers
and fi jd me out and devour nse^ and all my little
Hock that had been so long a gathering. These
thoughts afflicted me sxtreratly, and yet after ma-
ture cooliieretion, I concluded it was the best w*y
to throw myself upon the sovereign govenor of
the work', and to submit entirely to his mercy aud
provide ace.
After a world ef fears and apprehensions, for
thi ct nights aod days, I ventured out of my for-
tress, Sr. milked roy goat*, and after I had put every
tfci«g ia ordar, not without the greatest constsrna-
th>n, I wcat again to the shore to make my fur-
ther observations, and upon the whole concluded,
that either the island wsi inhabited, or that some
p*rs#ns had baen on /bore, and that I mi^ht be sur-
prized before I was aware. This put several fright-
ful notloss into nay head, insomuch that ^leep was
an entire straager tome, my whole thoughts being
taken up in nuihinj but my preservation, I put my
little castle into the best posture of defence I was
able, and placed all my guns so that they might
be (ervicable, if I should have occasion to make
use os them.
I divided ray goats into federal parcels ; ten /lie,
goats and twa he outs I put into one place of the
island, and the other ten with two he ones in aoo-
I and wsilil I was in search of this latter,
wsiicn w*s on the western pare of the island, I
thought 1 discovered a boat but at too great a dis-
tance to perceive what she was. Being come to
the shore, upon the S. W. part of the island, I was
•onvioceJ that they were savages after thty were
gone, by feeing th« place covered with the skull*
and wangled limbs of fcuman bodies. I observed
likewise a fort of a circle, and in the midst I per-
ceived there had beeu a fire about which I cot jes*
tured these wretches fat, and mtmafurally satrifi-
eed aid devoured their fellow creatmes.
The horror aud loathsomeness of this dreadful
spectacle coafouaded me so, that though I was sa-
lisfUd these savages never came into tht part of
the island vrh*re I was, yet such an abhorrence to
them seized me, that for two years [ confined my-
self to rnf castle, my cauutry seat and my enclo-
sures, and thus my circumstances remained for
hmc time undisturbed. But still n\y grand inten-
tion remit ?ed: which was to try if I could destroy
some of those savages, and save a victim, that I
might afterwards make my servant.
Many were myprojccttand contriranecs tobring
this about; at length I cam? to this fettled resolu-
tion, to lie privately in ambusi in some near con-
venient place, and let fly upon ihera with my gun
first, and thea falling in with my pistols and sword
in bund, I did not doubt but if i/iey were ixveoty
I should destroy them all and rescue the unhappy
victim they were going tosaoifice: and so much
did this proptfal please my fancy, that I was fully
refolven to put it in practice the fcrst opportunity,
and accordingly I soon found a place convenient for
my purpose; but, at the same time, bad several
checks of conscience and reasonings within myself,
concerning the lawfulness and justtesa of the at-
tempt, and after a long debate I concluded to lay
aside the design.
Whilst I was cutting dowa feme wood one day
to make charcoal to dress my meat, a*d do the fa-
mily necessaries, I perceived a very large cavity,
and going towards it, I could discern two large
eyes staring at me, upon which I made haste out,
extremely terrified, oot imagining wfcat it eould be
that looked so frightful, however, after I had re-
covered again from my surprize, I weot again in-'
to the cavity, resolving at al) hazards to fee what
it w*s> and when I carae near enough to discern ic
perfectly, what should it be aster ail kit a mon-
strous he goat lying on the ground, and gasping
for death, and dying lei mere old age.
The creature was notable to stand, a»d so I let
him lie undisturbed and employed myfclfin view-
ing the place, and making observations. At the
farther fide of it, I observed a sort os an entrance,
but so low I must be forced to creep into it up-
on my hand^ and knees: I had no candle, and the
place was d.crk, and so I suspended my ennw prize
till thi next day, when I returned with 6 large
ones of my own making-.
After I bad passed he strait passage, I found the
roof rose higher up; and sure whea I came
further in, no mortal cvei saw a more beautiful
sight ; the wail, and the ro@f i t Heeled a thousand
lights from my two candlts ; and indeed it seemed
to me the most delightful grotto I had ever keard
of. In sWt, I could fiud no fault but in the en-
trance, that I thought so render more proper for
my defence and security, and therefore I determin-
ed to make this place my principal magazine ; and
accordingly I brought hither with the utmost expe-
dition, feme arms and ammunition judging it im-
possible for me lobe surprized by the savages in that
fastness.
I think I was now in the 33d year of my reign,
and tolerably easy in my condition. By this time
my parrot had learned to speak English very well,
and many diverting hours we used to have together.
My dog died of old age, aod my cats eaerwsed and
• _ ( ( 60 )
multiplied so fast, that I was cften forced to destroy
some of them* lest I should be over run by their
numbers. I always kept two or three domesl c
g03ts about me, and had several fowls ih.u built
and bred about my castle, so that I wanted noihirg
but an honest companiou or two to make me as
happy as I could wish but al<<s ! what unfore-
seen events destroy the uncertain enjoyments of
human bappiuess!
It was now December, the time of my harvest,
wken going out one morning early there appeared
to me from the (hate, about two mil«8 distance
from me a flaming light from that part of the islaiid
where I had before observed some savages had beca
on my stde ol the water.
Terrified with this unusual spectacle and being
under dismal appreheoGoas that thtse sayages
would find me out and destroy me, I went direct—
]y to my castle, aud shut myself up at List ai I
could, and put myself in a posture of defence ; and
after this I got up to the top cf a rt ck, aod
viewing with my perspectiveghss, I could discern
co less than nine naked savages fit round a fire and
eating as I supposed human fkfh, with ihtir two
canoe* hawlfd upon the store, waiting for tbc
tide's carrying ihsm back again.
I waited wish impatience till they were gone}
when going to ti c place nothing c*n cxpicse my
deiestation of so ho»rid a light, especially when I
saw the limbs and fletfi of human creatmts lie torn
and mangled upon the ground : in short my indi£-
nation agianst thein rose so high, that let the con-
sequence be what it would, I was determined to be
iev«nged upon the first that sliould come tbiiher,
thu* I lost my life iu the attempt. I found after-
wards that they did not come over so this island very
often, and as near as I can remember, it wit a year
or more before 1 saw any of them ; but before I
proceed farther, I hare another accouot that will
deserve the readers attention. It was on the 2#th cf
Mty according to my wooden calender, after a ve-
ry terrible florin, when I wzs alarmed with she
noise of a gun, as fired from a ship in distress;
upon which I immediately ttok my perspective glass
and went up to the top cf the rtek, where I had
not been a moment but a static of fire g*ve notice
of another gun, and then I was co»firmed iu my
epinion that it could be nc-thinj else but a stiip in
distress; the weather being very hazy, I c#uld not
at that Time discover at what distance the ship lay,
or where she wa§, but the weather clcarieg up, I
sjiw with my glass that the wreck was upon those
hiJd?n rods where I wasjn great danger of being
lost in my boat.
I made a fire upon the hill by way-of sigaals,
and they saw it, and aoswered it with scvtral guns,
I had severalnotions ccactmiag them, as it is natu-
ral in such cafes ; but considering seriously the place
wnere they were and all other circumstances, I
could not conceive any possibility but that they must
'all be lost ; and hdeed to the lat y«ar of ay beiag
ou the island, I oevtr kotw of any that were sarei
out of the ship, I oily saw the bo«y of a boy which
was drove a fcore, but could not discover by him
of what nations they were.
Tbe sea was now very cajra, which temptei me
to venture to the wreck, do$ only in hopes to get
something I wanted, but likewise if there were a»y
body left alive in the ship, \o endeavour to save
their lives, This resolution so far prevailed, tbat
I went home immediately, and got every thing
ready for the voyage : and accordingly, after a
great deal cs labour, hazard and difficulty, I at
length gM to Ue wreck, which I beheld w/ih the
greatest piaty and concera. By her make I found
she w;iS a fpaoilh (hip, and had eodured a terrible
conflict before fbe was lost,
VV;»€u I came near to her, I saw a dog onboard,
•Who no sooner sa* me, but he fell a yelping and
howling, and I no sooner called to him, but the
poor cretaure jumped info the sej, and swam to
m?, anJ T tork him into the boat almofi f.mishcd.
W.;en I came i/»t > the ship, the fiist things r) ar I
bthsld were two drowr.cd men in she srms cf each
o?h;r; I found she was a rich ship, and as I have
re.if^n to belhve bound home from the Spanish
Weil Indies. What became of the itsl of the sail-
ors T couM not tell, t' ere bting none of (heir bo-
dies on b^ard besides the two already menrioned.
As I was rummaging abous her, I found several
things I wanted, viz. a fire fh« vel and tongs, two
brass kettles, a potto make chocolate, some horns
of 6ne glared powder, a gridiron and several other
necessaries Thtfe I put on board my boat toge-
ther with two chests, and a cask of rum, an-j after
a g eat deal of toil and difficulty, I got safe back
to the island.
I reposed m} si-If that night in the boat* and the
next day l«n-!ed ray cargo, which I carried to my
grofto, and having exa »inrd my effects, found in
the two chef's, several things that I wanted, par-^
ticwlarly some shirts and handkerchiefs I found''
likewise three bag of pieces tf ei ht, all wi icN I
would willingly have i-i'-en sir five or six pair of
Sn^Ufli ftocs and stockings.
After T had stowed all ihii new cargo iamycaye
I made he bell of my ay to my carHe, where I
found every th nc as 1 had lift »t, ib ti»*t*I had no-

As I lay on my bid t»ne » ight in March the %4\h
year of my soli ude, I r n t*sri<u(ha ' the acc;>uiite
of my li e, irora my vrry rvmembr^ca e to the pre-

alMa«ce I must htvt perished inevitably,
Af.e* I had t us biiefly debited with myself my
.present andformer co di^o ^> I began next to con-
sider the nature of - hose hwagts, aud the country
where iluy in'-Tabbed i ho* far it was id tfn place
from whence they came, what .boats they hadA®
bring them hither, and had likewise an inte ntion to
go to their side t« see what discoveries I couid make
I had notioDi that if by any method I could get
"upon the continent, I might io time meet with a
ship lo carry me to Europe ;sor bere I looked upon
myself to be the most miserable man living, and
preterrei trea death itself to my Oay in this de-
solate island. Whilst my thoughts were thus in
confusion, I had no notion o£ any thing but sny
voyage to the continent ; and indeed so much
was I now inflamed with these nation?, that I
in a great measure, forgot my duty 10 God,
and was reduced almoft to a state of despera-
tion ; and after many thoughts and irugglings,
In aay auiad, I came at length 10 this conclu-
iioo, viz that th« only probable way I had to es-
cape was to ;-e< nm of these savages, which I could
find no other way to bring about than by venturing
jny life to deliver him out of the jaws of his dcrou-
reri wh'ch I nought must iafpire him with grati-
tude to is deliverer.
These were my fixed resolutions ; but I think it
was At le.ist a year and a half before I could fit d an
opportanhyof ptmiogthera in execution.To the best
•f my remembrance, It was mt third day of April
early in tie imcrning wh«n I was surprized with'
the si^ht <?f five canoes all upon the shore together,
on my itic of the island, and ire creatures tSat
belonged to them a'l U den and out of fight. At
first, I thought all tle'e boats must briag too
xnaay to be aiuctei by a single person and was in
a mighty confusion wkat was ihe best to be done;
howtrer being impatient to sec something t^f thtir
management, I took my gnos and went secretly to
the top of the hill where by the help of my per-
spective ghfs, I obf.rved no less than thtriy, fining
round a fire a* d feasting upou what meat they
had dressed; what it w*s, I could a A ciistio^uislj ^
but they were all dancing sr und the es, and
using many ^ri^hifui and barfcarious gest-ues.
Whilst I wa^ lo» king earnestly au the£ wietcFes
I could discern thrm d«aggiDg two Ctiic;able crea-
ture^ out of one of tie b^ais. It was not long be-
fore I si\v one &i them k -.ecked down and three
or four </f them fell to c w\ g aad mangling hi»
body, for their cookery, in order to devour him
as they had done the rcimer.
W*ifst the other miserable creature stood ex-
pect; g every moment the fate o* his companion*
suspired wuh the jopes oi I if* he gave a frudea
start fntn them, and ran with g eat swiftness to-
wan;s my castle ^three i f them followed him. and
i was under great app'.eh<nfr»:is that he wsulc! fly
to my gt'i? f >r ;;io;ectbn. I was glad o fee he
had the heels of mem, and from his Iw illness con-
cluded be coul t pieiently lose fig t of tfeem, and
s^e his Use. There w<& a little oe k just before
hjm, where I was afraid the pocr vict-m vvowld be
trfken U he c.mld not swim ; but it happened that
he swam vciy wdl, and soot- got uvcr5 and ran
again whh hb for at er st-e, gih and fwi uefa. Two
t at followed *im Iwam over after him, but the
other thai could not swim returned back to his
companions. And now or ntyr 1 thought it was
m) time to procure a savage fr *iy ca© par ion.
Accordingly, \*ith all the fp< e 1 could I came
dovn irom she roek: aud taokuj my two gun?, rc*
solving to save the victim if possible ; *nd in order
to it came a nearer way* and put myself between
She pursuers aad tbe puilueo^ beckoning 10 tfee
latter to stand still, who, you may imagine, was
not a little amazed at the fight of me. The first
purluir I knocked down with the (lock of my
piece, and the other, who I perceived was pre-
senting his bow and arrow lo slioo^ ac, I ict fly at
Mm, and k/lled him dead upon the spot. The poor
frighted Indian was terribly amazed to sea the fire,
and hear the nolle of the gun; however, I m.tde
a Ggn to him to come to me, which at length he
did, but oot without a great deal of !earand
trembling, being afraid, I bclive. 1 would kill
ahem too. I did all a could to convince him of his
mistake, and at length so f*r convinced bint by the
jsijns I made him, th.tf he came to me, and threw
himself at my feet, and took one ol my feet aud
put it to his hea i, which was a token, it seems, to
he ray (lave torever; upon which I took him up,
inade iiuch of him, aud encouraged him in tt e
best manner I could-
By this time I saw the savage I had knocked
down be^an to recover, and was got upon his breech
•which made my new slave a* much afr.dd as be-
fore ; but I soon prevented Irs flight by presenting
my piece at him ; buf my iavage opposed my/hoot-
ing him, making a sicjn to me to lend him my sword
•which hung by my fid* ; & no sooner had 1 grant-
ed his requtst, but away he runs to his enemy, and
veiy dexitroinly at one blow cut ofF his head, and
as * taken of triumph bmu^ht it to me, together
with the sword, and laid them both down at my
feet.
The greatest istonifhment my new servant was
in, was b»)w 1 came to kill the savage at that dis-
tance, witkout a bnw and arrow ; and to sati fy
fcimsclsisl that matter, he made fl^ns to me to let
bTm go view the body, which I granted ; aster he
had tu.aed him, aad viewed she wound the bullet
had made in his breast, he look up his bow aad at -
rows, anJ came back to me again, inakisg signs
lo me to give him leave io bury them, which
(with my consent) he performed with wonder-
ful dex-.erhy. When I perceived he had done,
I called him away, and carried him dir<.cliyto my
cave, where I gave him victuili, and tbtu pointed
to him to lie iowd upon a heap of straw, ai d fake
a little rest. He was a very handsome well-propoi-
tioned fellow, and in afi -respects the most beautiful
Indian I had ever seen- I think he bad not sept
abuve an hour b<fore he came out o) the cave to
me as I was milkj'jg &y goats, and again threw
hi.ns.If at my feet, and put my other foot upon i is
head, as'a further token that he intended to be my
sUve forever.
As I understood him in many things I made him
sensible I waa veiy well pleased with him, and in a
little time I be/.ao to speak w th him and learn him
how to talk with me. Li the fiist pl.<ce I made him
understand his name v as to be Fiid*y, because it
was upon that day I saved his life ; then I taught
him 10 fay master, vfnic:- I made him sensible was
lo he my name. I likewise learned bimjo fay y<S
and no and to know what they meant. I gave him
some milk in an earthen pot, making him view; rue
whild I diank it before him, and sopt my bread ia
it, and I gave him a cake ©f bread, causing him
to do the like, to which he readily consented, mak-
ing signs of the greatest satisfaction imaginable.
That night we stayed in the cave^ but early the
•next morning I mads signs to him to rile and go
with me, aud withall made him to understand that
- I I uenJeJ to g've some cloaihs to hide hi- na-
kedness As we passed by the place where the two
sav4g$» were bailed he po'tnttd diiectly lo the
graves, and let me know by his gestures, that he
intended to dig them up and devour them; upon
which I let him lee I w*s extremely displeased at
it, and beckoned to him to come away, which he
diil with the greatest reverence.
In our way to the c*stle we went to the top of*
hill, to view it the swages were goce and sliding
thtre wai uo more oi them to he seen, we resrtf&r
ed ou:selves that nigh', and the next morning.
I i cLlved to arm myself, and to tak: my man with-
me,.aid go and view the place where thry com-
mitted their barberities. When we came upon the
spot, n was impossible to view the horribleitjs of
t-e sp'cticle. Here lay t'ie fi.sh and entrails. a-\d
thut t'»e mangled limbs oi human creatures;, ia
ihart, the fi„ht filled me with the greatest h tror
and detestation. Friday gave me to understand that
thtre were thiee, sicrficcd there, and i( I had not
rescued him he h*d bcea the fourth. I made hiin
gathe: up the iragmeuis and lay them in a heap,
and then I made a great fire upon then> and burnt
them to aslirs; and yet flSli I found" that my nun
h.id an hankering after the flesh, which T relented
v-'ith the utmost abhorrence, and ier *im know by
some angiy tt.ken 1 gave him, that if ever I found
him g-jilty cf any such barbarity I should certain-
ly ik"'£ him.
Alter this we returned to my castle, where I
cloathed my man as well as the nature of the place
and my circumstances would admit. He seemed -at"
first a linle uneasy and aukward in hh n:w dress;
4mt after be had worn them 4 or jf days, tie grew
/
familiar with them, and seemed extremely well sa-
tisfies. Mow my next concern was how I might

?he God Pamnv ke-*; kui all he could say os him
ihat be was very ©Jdj muth older lhaa the
ea and land, moon ard star?, and that he lived %
gi t at way beyond them alL
When I bad enquire! as f*r ss I thought conve-
nient into (he manner of fervmg their God, I pro-
ceded according to ihe best of rsy knowledge to
instruct him in t*e Christian leligion, and laid be-
fore him fevetal cf ihe chief truths upon wWcb it
was grounded, to which he gave ihc greatest at-
te;.t*o and would <-sk very pertinent questions by
tbe way of information. In short, I soon perceiv-
ed th«s poor creatare every day improve by my in*
struction, and thus my endeavours to instruct him
wer* a great help to myself and brought those things
afresh its) my memory which the legnth of time
h?.d almost defaced-;so th^t I had ihs greatest rea-
son to bless Providence for fendirg him to rxe m
this state of solitude. Fits company allayed the
thoughts of my misery, and made my habitation
more comfortabig than it had ever been Gice my
fLst coming to the island. It brought to my mind
daily notions of Heaven, and heavenly things,
and filled me with a secret joy, that I ^ as ever
breught into this place wkich I once thought was
lie most miserable part cf the universe.
By tlh time Fr^day had made great improve-
men's lu hii Engli/L, tho' a little broken.. We con-
versed vviih great famiiiari'y, aad I took a psnicu»
lar pleasure so relate to him the several accidents
and adventures of my life. I soon made him un*
derstand that wonder!ul mystery, as le conceived
it, of tin gun powder and ball, and taught him to
fli3ct, which he soon learrcJ to great perfection.
I gave nim a knife, which he w*s very proud of;
likewise a belt aad hatchet, which wiih the rest of
his acccmremeait, m$dt him fookliks Don Quixctc
when he went lo engage the wind mills. After ik's
I g\we him a particular description cf Europe, and
old." England, the place of my nativity, above all
She rest. I also gave him a Urge account of my be-
ing shipwrecked, and carried him and shewed him
flic ruins of the skip's boat, which, though it w*s
almost rotten and falling to pieces, yet I could per-
ceive he took particular notice of it, which made
me ask him the season why he pondered so much
upon it; to which he replied, without hesitation,
Me see a boat like :h:s come to a place in my nati-
on, and by fmther tokens he gave me, I c*m? to
understand, thai t! e boat was cuiven in by a storm.
Ii presently came into my mird, that this must be
some European boat I hat was forced there by stress
of weather, asier the loss of the ship, which put me
upon an enquiry, what sort of a boat this was and
who came with it? He told me they were white
men that came in the boat, and they were 16 in
number, that they were all alive, and that his
coar.rrymen were v:ry kind to them : upon which
it came into my thoughts, that these must be the
crew that belonged to the snip that was cast away'
upon my island, who rather than be devoured in
the ocean, had-commited themselves to providence,
and consequently were drove a shore among the
wild Indians.
The notions I had of the cruelty of these savages;
nude me ask Friday several questions concerning
them.- He told me he was very certain they still
livtd there, and were well treated : I asked him
how it came to pass that they did not kill them,
and eat them as they do one another? His answer
was in broken English* that they made friends with
them. He farther added, that neither his nation
oer any otl er nation that be knew of cat their f«I*r
low creutttictf but inch whom the law of arms al-
fowed to be deroured* and theywtre only those
*bofe misfortune it was to be m^de prisons of
war*.
Sometime after tin's, upon a my clear day my
©an and { wer* up to the top of a very high bill,
oo the east side of the isUnd, fiom whence I bad
©net bvfoie £e;i t'#Ccntmtatof Ame* tea. I could
cot immediately icil what Was the matter, far Erf-
day on a fudde^ fell to danci*ig4nd juropieg* as if
he had b- ea a ad, I fked htm the reason os his joy^
0 ! *ays he, I Aemy counts y, and -the very pfa£t
where the white, a ea live tcgtther. Upon Which
1 could not t.hioki: but that if he couid by
any rr* ans g-i lo re, he would sorgtt all I heil
4nxt or hiajjitnd j erhaps biiog bit countrymen in*
$5 my island io deftroy me J but to my shames
s^e^k it, my jea'ousy was very ill greunded: for
the p» oi feilo-v w*s quhe of a diffcr«nt^jic£tl-\
oa ; *nd *s I found afterward* would have fret If
k st his life, faifti* tha i bare left me, or done me
an injury > ~ ^.
Soon after this, I asked him if he had not a de~
fire to g i into his own aouotfy? Hbaufwcr Wat,
He lo?*d h*s country very well, bufcjhewonki not
go without me": Friday, lays It wSt stidi I d«

deal of good there j you'll leam them tolnre good
tiVcpt and make all the wild men boÆttame arieso-?
btr« Mm says I Friday, what you fey n rout of;

A%eaj?oa,por will I venture mjfdf among them, %
mjoxi (hall go yourself and lea?e *ne alote* a* \,
W$&tefattl$tf*&^ jour life "vyk"

Nev*r was any poor innocent creature rm>re
thunderstruck than poor Friday was at these words,
especially when I told him he would be at liberty
to go as soon as we could get a boat ready to car-
ry him. This put him into a greater agony,yet
dellring mt to kill him, for, fold he, I had much
rathet ah thaa lose so good a friend, and so kind a
ma&a*. When he spoke this the tears ran down
his cheeks so plentifully, thai, I had much ado to
refrain from weeping myself. I was forced to
comfort him in the best manner I could, telling
him, if he was willing to Hay with me, I would
naver part with him as long as I lived.
In short, the fellow's hmclly and sincere beha-
viour, soon convinced me of ihe unreasonableness
of my jealousy, and Friday became more dear to
me than ever. I ideed I thought that tfererX
could get to the continent, and join those white
men, Friday had mentioned, it might be a means
to further my return lo my native Country. Inor»
der to thh Friday aud I went to the w&odsto look
out for a large iree to huild a canoe, which with
much dilncuhy, weetfeclcd in about 6 weeks time,
aud with much trouble and pain, got her into the
\Vater. I was very much r^jokad at the launch-
ing of ttm little man of war, which Fiiday mana-
;ged with great dexterity, and a (lured me it wa»
large enough to carry us over and that if I thought
proper, he was ready to venture with me.
I l«ked the poor fellow's honest proposal, but at
the sune time, I thought if I could procure a mast
and sail, it would be betur ; which with tae great-
ed dttBcuhy, imaginable, in 3 months time, I made
a shift to patch together, and after this too, I had
my man Friday to instruct in the art of oarigatfoa
whisii before he hi<j $9t i&e least qotioa &
I was dow entered upon the a?ih year of
reign, or rather of my captivity, and kept the an-
niversary of my landing with greats* solemnity loan
ever, having received such res eased signals of Di-
vine favour in ruy dellve* anse, preservation aed
prosperity.
I now wanted for *ioih?o£, and yet my mw4
*was still intent upon my deliverance; and in tiuik
I bad a strong impression upon wt that I should
nm be anoiher year io this illaud; yet ail! I con-
tinued my husbandry, and made the necessary pre-
paration* for my iubstllancc The r«dny season
coming on, we were forced *o continue sot she molt
part within doors having* hist mad* al» neceflary
preparations for the security Snd safety os n>y
new boat, Vl\ the months of November and De-
cember, at which time I was fully determined to
fail over to the Continent, and no sooner did it be-
gin to draw near, but I began to make preparati-
ons for my intended expedition; asd in a fort—
night'* lime I proposed to open roy little dock,
and let out the boat for that purpose.
One morning as I was busy in making preparati-
ons for my voyage, Friday, whom I had lent to
the sea snore to look for a turtle, came running in
a terrible fright and said, I have very bad hews
yonder are 3 or4 canoes upon the coast ; and they
eonie to look for poor Friday. S&J*,I they wilJ eat
me as well as you, and therefore we must resolve*
to sight for ourlive*. Friday replied trembling, Me
will fight as well as I"xan but I ata afraid they arc
too many io number far us; but I will obey your
•rdei c, and loss the last drop of my blood fbr you.
Wiitaut ftttibcr disputes we tail to loading o*r
arms, and making every thing ready for the onset
when we bad double armed ourselves and put every
thing in tbe best posture that could be, I took my
perspective glass, and went up lo tbe top of a bill
to try what I could discos er, and I soon perceived
they were twenty savsge* and 5 prisoners, waicb
I concluded by their manner os acting were to be
devoured.
This dismal and inhuman spectacle filltd mt
whluhe utmost horror and detestation, 8c tbe more
so because I saw a while mao, who by their acti-
, ons ar^d preparations, I found was to be the next
fact lice ; tbis made m: make all the speed I could
being fully determined to deliver him or perish in
the attempt; and so I gare Friday order t© follow
me, aad do every thing that be saw me do. When
we came to a proper distance, undiscortred ; I
gave the word to Friday to firs, as I did tbe very
fame moment. We took our aim so well, that be-
tween us we killed 4, and wounded 3 or 4 more*
No man can express the consternation and confu-
sion these savages were in, upon this unexpected'
accideat: However act to give them any respite,
we took up some other arm*, and let My upe>n them
a second time killed two more of them and wound*
ed Hveral others; which added so to their coofu*
Son that they rao yelling and screaming about like
mad creatures. Says I, Friday, take the aharged
gua and fcllov/me ;£b /hewing ourselves to them,
and at the same time giving a great shaut, we
went directly to die victim, and immediately cut
*he bands from bis hands and legs, and lifiirghina
up, I alked him in ibe poituguefe language, what;
he was? He told me in latin he was a Spaniard*
aad « Qhn&im mi a&«$ (wtumlag ifcc best ackaow-
fedgeDaents be ctuld for his deliverance, he wa*
about lo give rac an account of hit misfortunes^ but
I prevented hrm> telling him, That would do bel-
ter at another lirae; and further said, Sigaior, vc
will ulk hereafter (mt now our business is fighting,
1 gave hiaa a dram aud a peace of bread to reft -fk
hmi, and then gave him a sword and pistole, and
bid him do what he could, a»d to give the man
hit due, no one could behave himself wi h greater
courage. In short, we so managed the matter,
that of the %o fa rages, not above 5 < r 4 escaped;
and those I was resolved to pursue and endeavour
to iistroy too, if possible ;accordingly I leaped in-
to one of their cauoes, and ordered Friday to fol-
low me: but I wa* no sooner got in but I law
another poor creature bound hand and fool for the
slaughter. I presently helped him up, but he wa*
so faiat and weak, that be chiU neither stand or
speak but groaned sadly, il>i kir>|» he was now to
be sacrificed. 1 bid Fr'uK j speak to him, and as-
sure hiw of nil deliverance When he w*a a little
recovered and sat upon the boat, and Fryday be-
gan to hear htm speak, and had looked upon htm
uftre t'uiiy, you cannot imagine the poor fellow's
transport: at length when he had recovered him—
self, he told me that the other , exsv\ was his fa-
ther j and, in truth, he g4Yc such uncommon tefti-
monies of his duty and *ff cti-e, ih<t I* must
seeds own I was very much affectM with \t,
In (hon, with a gre*t deal of ; iificuhy we gat
bot^ the Spaniard and Friday's father home to my
castle* where I nude ineni a handsome tens, and
treated tb«m iu the best manner ray chcumstai.ct*
would allow. And thu»v l»ke an ab ^hue Ki» g, I
foveraed my little dotaiaiou, aud findtug that my
»tw subjects were very weak I ordered Friday to
kill one of my kids, and stowed znd boiled the
flesli, aod made them some very good broth, and
dined with (hem myself. Alter dinner, I ordered
Friday to go to the field of battle, and fetch home
the a&ns. < and tbeti I desired him lo enquire cf his
father, if he though! it polubfe for those sivagcs
to out-ride she storm, which began at their going
o£, or, if they got home, whether he thought they
would not return In great number* and endeavour
to destroy us. Hi* aj.ii.wer was, That if they did
reach their own couutiy, which he hardly thought
possible, yet the strangeness of their being attacked
would certainly make thtm tell the people, that
they were certainly destroyed by thunder and light-
ning, and whoever weal to that island, would cer-
tainly be destroyed by the hands of GODS, and
not of man; and the Illaod was enchanted; and
that the Gods sent fire from above, to destroy ail
those that fLonld land in lu
This-account having freed me of my apprehen-
sions, and for a long time no Canoes uppenriog ; I
resolved to pursue my intended *oyag«, Friday's
father having a timed me I ralgbt depend upon
good usage from the people of hfs country; at to
the Spaniard, I asked him his opinion ;he t*ld roe
they were 14. that xrere cast upon the istand, and
that thry had a good understanding with the Indi-
ans but were in want of necessaries for the support
of human life; and that if I thought proper, ht
and the old savage would go out fust, and settle all
roatrers in order to our reception: aad at the fame
jime, he told me, they would all swear fidelity to
me and own me as their leader.
t^poa these assurances, I resolved to send tbfrm
over: but when every thing was ready the 5 pa air
ard started this material odjeclioo : You know, Sir,
fay* he, I know the leogth of your flock; and
though you may havt enough for us that are now
with you, yet when you enlarge your family, I am
sensible it com never beiiitikient to support us long,
and therefore my advice is io wait another hai-
cil, and in the meaa time to prepare as muck
ground as possible, whereby we may hate proviii?
ons to carry on our design* This advice 1 liked
extremely, and from that moment I always esteem-
ed the Spaniard, and made him my Privy Coun-
sellor on ail occasions. We all four went to work,
and prepared as much ground as would (orr sft
bu&ela of barky, and 16 of rice, which was all
the feed we had to spare; and al the Came time I
took all the care imaginable, to eacrease and pre-
serve my Goats, by shooting the wild damiand ta-
king the young kids and putting them into inclo-
sures ; and took such other measures, that, by the
blessing of God upon our own industry, after bar-
vest, we had provisions to victual a slbip for any
part of America-
The principal occasion being thus anfw«r«d, I
gave my two ambassadors, a musket each, with S
charges of powder and bail, wiife provisions fit for
their expedition, and away I sent them, 'fktf had
not been gone a fortnight,, but I began to grow
impatient for their return.. Whilst my thoughts
were perpetually takeo up with the expectation of
them a very strange accident happened which was
first discovered by my man Friday, who, one morn-
ing came running to me, crying out, They are
came they arc come : upon which I jumped from
ray bed and looking towards the sea, I perceived
a boat about a league and a half diflasce, standing
directly in for the shore. I soon found that these
were none of the company I expected ; for by the
help of my glass. I found that this boas must be-
long to some ship; which by calling my eyes a-
bout, I plaiuly di'c:?ve»ed lyin^r at anchor, atspmc
distauct at sea, which by ihc fashion os her long
boat, &c I concluded must be aD Kn^lislh v>ss;i.
Great were kj ttai;s.>orts on thr unexpected
fight, which brought into my miod fresh notions of
deliverance ; ani ) et I had some cauii^nafy thoughts
*wbich 1 cons els were of use to me after wart's It
was not loog- before 1 saw the boat approach the
shore, and then I was fully convinced ihit they
Were English. I Uw four of them leap upon the
shore, and take $ out with them, thit locked like
prisoners, who, I observed made paffiooa e ges-
tures of intreaty; and not knowing wl a< t* e
meaning might be, beckoned to F»ilay, wh > was
Xiear to me, io go to the top of the mountain and
make what discoveries h? could, who "ma lu:le
time resuming back, O ! f*ys he mast's, y< u fie
Englishmen eat œuds as well asstvagrg. But of
thisl soon convinced him to the contrary ; and yet
I could not help thinking but th*re must be some-
thing very barbari ms in hand. I coul i not per-
ceive they had any fire arms, but lather th, t they
Wtre preparing to kill their 3 campani ns *hh
their sw( rds 5 and now it was, 1 lamented \ny w,»nt
of power, to preserve them. However, \o my
great satisfaction, I fou^d that they mined ibur
prisoners up into the'desolate is^rd^s they houghs'
to be either sta ved, or devoured by wild beasts
and rambled about tke woo 1 to make observations
so long, iiil the tide was gone, and the boat a-
ground,
lo sliortt I considered what sort «f men I had
now to deal wi h, aau therefore resolved to act
with aHt c caution imaginable, and so concluded
)l «u . cit m»i to mike any attempt til! it grew
d*ik ; but hr day being exerflive hoc, I concluded
the tadort were Ifvi in t ic shade to fleep, aad per-
ccui g 5 ji-uT disconsolate creatures fitting no-
des a tree at some distance from me, I made a*
«H>te to do, but went up to them, asking them in
the S^a^fh tongue, What they were? At which
they ILru J up aud being surpriaedat the oddaes? of
my dress., they began to avoid me ; but I called
to them in English, not to be afraid; forynu have
a fiend nearer to you than you expect, tel! me
yuur condition, and is it be in »y power, I willN
serve you faithfully. Sir, »>oe of them, the
(lory i* lee long a* present: I was raafier of the
(hip t'?ai lies yoader at aochdr, my men having
mutinied, anil it h a favar they have put this pas-
senger, roy mate, aid I, on (Lore ia this island,
without Murdering us, tbo' we have no profpeJt
$>ut tm perish here for waat of the necessaries of
life. Says I, have they auy fire arms? Only two
fuzees, replied he, aud one of them is new left
behind in the boat, and if the two desperate roguts
that ave with them could be taken, l am pretty well
assured the rtA would retuva to their duty. Well,
said I, let us now retire a little farther under the
covering of the wood, and we will talk farther.
And there it was I made several conditions with
thew, which they very gratefully and honefily per-
formed.
It wa*not long before we came to a resolution

him to recover his ship, which they all promised to
do, in the most solem n manner; however I advi-
sed the captain to keep them bou»d, and then our
next cure was to secure the boat, without which it
was Impossible to reach the flip. To shorten the
relation as much as possible, we concerted all our
measures so well, that at last the ship w»i recovered
according to our wish, aud new there remained
noshing but the disposal of the prifonus, the roost
danger/out of whieh we resolved to leave ou the
island. I gave him arms, and all the necessaries
I had in my caflie ; aud teliing them all my whole
story, I charged them to be kind lo the spaniards
that I sent for over. T h*y promised me very fair,,
and so Ijfnformed them of every thing necessary for
their subsistence ; so taking wish me my man Fri-

who to#k me on board oa the coast of Africa* and
to learo from him, what was become of my plan-
tations at the BraGIs. According to my wisli, after
some little search, I found him out, who gave me
a very satisfactory account of all matters, more
particularly of my plantations in the Brasils, which
had been so honestly managed in my absence, that*
beyood my expiation, I found myself worth
40o»l sterling ; with which, as soon as possible, I
resolved to make the best: of my way to England,
and by the advice of the captain, I was persuaded
to travel by land to Calais, which had like to hava

bears were driven out of the woods, and tho5 we
were more than 20 of us together, they set upon

When 1 CMtiiC t: Linden, I found try bills of

cime into my mind to return to Lisbon, aud from
thence to the BraGIs, to look after my plantation;
but upoa second thojghts, I cor eluded it best to
fell it ; upon this account, I thought proper to
write to my correspondent at Ufboo, anddeG cd

mise io do all that he could for me ; and in truth as

every panieuhr, with the greatest justice and in-
tegrity.
Io /bore, he lold my estate for me to the best
advantage, and remitted to me for if, bills for

adieu to all foreign adventures, 1 had no other care

afterwards I married a virtuous young gentlewo-
man, of a good family* by whom I had two sons
aod a daughter, but she dying, I grew disconsolate
and melancholy, and at the instigation of my ne-
phew, resolved I would once more make a voyage

CONTAINING a full ACCOUNT of hit
Travel* ami remarkable Transactions
both by SEA and LAND.
MY new kingdom ran continually in roy mind
anil look up my thoughts both day and
night ; -insomuch, that my wife took notice of it
and would often ask me the reason of my extraordi-
nary thoughifulnefs, supposing my marriage with
her might be the c*ufe. Her tend?r expressions,
together with the concern I had for the preserva-
tion of my family, at length brought me to a refo-,
lution to.feit'e myself in some fixed way of living;
accordingly I bought a little farm in Bedfordshire,
with a resolution to remove thither t upon this,
there ^as a pretty little convenient house, fur-
rounded whh land very capable of improvement,
which fui.ed my temper, as to planting, managing
and cuittvaUoB, Nor was it long before I entered
upo.i my new settlement, having bought plowii^
iiarrows, carti, waggons, horse?, cows and stieep;
so that I now led the life of a country gentleman*
In this rural retirement, I began to think myself
as happy as I could wish, wbsa on a sudden all my
happloess was destroyed by the unexpected lose of
my wife.
Her death gave me a fort of contempt of ihe
world, aud filled me full of different thoughts and
inclinations. My country life grew bmthensome
to me, and in (tort, I left my »arm, left off house-
keeping, and in a sew months after, returned to
JLoudoo, but there I could find nothing to emer-
lai'a me and divert my melancholy. It was now
the beginning of the year i6#$> when my nephew
"whom I had bred up to the lea, was returned fr«ra
his voyage, captain of the ship he went out in ^
•who coming to me one morui g, told me it was
proposed to him by some merchants, to make a
voyage to the East Indies, aud if I would go, he
would undertake to Luid* me upon my island, that
I might have an opportunity to enquire into the
slate »,f my new kingdom.
Just before he came to me, it came into my-
thoughts to get a patent, & sill my ill and with in-
habitants. -What devil, said I, sent you hither with
this meÆage? And though I liked the motion, yet
I would not let him know it at sirll; however after
a little pause, I told him if be would set me down,,
and call for me at his return, I would ceruinly ga
with brro. As to calling for me as he came backb-
ite told me it was impracticable: but, fays lie, I
will tell you what we can do: we may put r sloop
ready framed on board, which may be easily put'
together at any time, and so i might return with
pleasure. I was not long in forming my resoluti-
on, but couiraiy to the advice of all my friends, I
was fully determines] to undertake the voyage, and
in order to it, I made my will, aad put all my af-
faire in the befl posture I poffibiy could, and so wab
my trusty servant Friday, in the beginning of Ja-
nuary, i£$4, I went on board, baring, besides
th it sloop already raeottoned, a very considerable
cargo for my own colony- First, 1 had some ser-
vants, whoro I proposed to leave there as inhabi-
tant?, or work while I llaid there, at they should
appear willing- There were two carj e Ui?, a
smith, and a very ingenious fellow, who was Jack
ot all trades; for he wa*s not only a cooper, by
tr4rJe, but also he was dexterous at making wheel*
and band mills to grind corn, likewise a good tur-
ner and a go d j ot maker. 1 also canied a tay-
lor, who consented to Hay in a y plantation, and
proved a most necessary fellow in the island. As
to my cargo, it con filled of a sufficient quantity of
line-* and English Huff, sjrcloalhing the Spaniards
that I expected to si d du re ; as likewise gloves,
bats, shoes, and (lockings ; togeii cr with beds
bed Jog, and h use hold stuff, especially kichea
nteosiis, with pots, kettlis, pewter, br*ss, &c. al-
so na'ls, t'jols ot all sorts, staples, hooks, l.imvcs
aud all otner things mcess\ry ; all which, I think
cost me about 50a#U Nor was this all; tor I car-
ried an hu >dre \ spare arms, muskets and suzees,
beGJes fume pistols, a conGdersble quautiiy of se-
ver a! sons nf (hot, too barrrls of powder, 2 brass
canion, bt-Gies swords cutlÆs, and the iron part
or some pike* and halberts ; and I made my ne-
phew take 2 Xnall quirur-deck gui.s more than
he had occasion sot iu his ship, to Lave behind, if
there was a necessity, so that we might build a
fort tlure, and man it against all opposcrS.
We had not been long at sea, bn* we were over-
taken by a storm, which drove us upon the coast
of Ireland, as far as Galway, where we were e-
bilged to flay 2o days for wind. On the 4th oi
February the wind presented, and we had si vety
good gale for several days. On the soih late in
the evening the mate called out, That he saw a
flash of fire and heard a gun, upon which we all
ran to the quarter-deck, from whence, at a dis-
tance we saw a rerrible fire, which from our rec-
koning concluded could be no other than a stiip
that had taken fire at (ca, and that it could not be
far off, from the report of the guns, which we
heard several times. We made to it with all our
fail, and s*on perceived it was a great (hip, bur-
ning ia the middle of the lea ; I immediately or-
clcrdcd 5 guns to be fired that the poor people
might perceive there was deliverance at hand, who
consequently might endeavour saving their lives
in their boats, nor was it long before the ship blew
up...
We hung out our Ianthorns, and about 8 in the
morning, when it began to grow light, we (aw
two boats making towards us, so we made a sig-
nal to them to come on board, and took them all
up, being men, women and children, in all 64.
We found it was a French ship of So* tons com-
ing from Canada, and that by the negligence of
the htlma man, it was set on fire iu the steerage;
and that in all probability, if Providence had not
sent us to their assistance, they had every foul pe-
rished.
Never was people certainly (o overjoyed, as these
poor wretches were. Among the passengers there
were a priests, an old one and a young one ; the
';? eldest was a stupid old fellow, but the young one
was a modest fine gentleman. His bchavour was
very reaaarkabU. At his entrance on hoard he fell
•o hh f*ce ?o *h« rftofl bumble prostration so the
AJpighiy. I chought indeed ht had fallen into a
swoon, «tnd so ran to help him up; but ha modestly,
told me, he was returning his (hanks io the alaugfu
ty> dsfiring me to lear* him a few mouirnts, and
that, next Jo his creator, he would return me thanks
a'fo. And indeed he did so about thvce minute*
•with great serfousiess and affecYiOQ, though the
te»ri Hood iu his eyes, which eenfirmed the gratis
fude of hit foul. Nor did he less shew his pies/
and wisdom, in applying himself to his country
g>*op]«, and labouring to compose them by the
rooli powerful reasons, arguments and persuasions,
And wheti; indeed, these people had taken their
nights repose, in such convenient lodgings as our
/hip would allow, we found nothing but the best
manners, and the most civil acknowledgements,
for which the French arc eminently remarkable.
Next morning the captain anc! rhe young" priest de-
fired to speak with me, and oil tred us the money
and jcwehthey had saved, which I refused, telling
them, our business wag to save them ; they told u«
that then aH they bad to deiiie of us was, to set
them on ILoie somewhere on our paisage. As to
landing we tola1 them that bring bound to the Eaft~
Indies, we could not do that withou* changing our
Gowfe anil that we could not justify ; but wt
would carry them, till we met with some (hip
bound either 10 England or France, that wduld
take them on board; however we resolved to land
them at Newfoundland, which was not much.out
of our way : and according as we proposed* in a*
bout a week's time, we came to Newfoundlands
where they bhrtd a bark to «arry them to France,,
all but the young priest, who chofs to go*
aud 2 or | of tbt sailors.
Now directing our course to the S- S. E. about
2o days after, we met with another adventure th^t
gave us a fresti opportunity to exercise our hum Jt-
iiy. In the laiitude cf 27, we saw a sail b&ring
towards us that fead loll all her mafls ; and firing
a gon in token of distress i the wind being ac N.
we soon came to speak with her, and fount her to
be a sliip of Bristol bound home from B2ibadocs,
• hat had bsen driven cut of the road by a furious
hurricane. They had been tossed about the sea for
fey era! days, and were sLiiost starved.
Id this ship there were three passengers, a gen-
tle woman, her son, and maid servant ; these we
found io the most miserable condition that can be
imagined. The gentlewoman, died, and it was not
without the greatest care add difficulty that pre-
served the young man and the maid, whom at iluir
earnest entreaty, after we bad suppilied the ship
.with what we could spare, we took on board our
own (Lip.
We werenowin hr'tude 19, but pasting by some
little incidents, I shall relate what is most rentaik.
able, relating to ray little kingdom, to which I was
drawing nigh It was with no small trouble that
we got to the South side of my island; however,
at length we came to anchor at the mouth of the
little creek,'aud then we soon ft w my own little #as-
tie, and I kaew perfectly where I was. When 1
was .certain of the place, I called to Iriday, and
asked him is he knew where he was? The fellow
who knew the place as well as myself, replied whh
a'great deal of joy and pleasure, I know very well
where we are : yonder is our castle, and point-
Islg to the hill, I sec, says bc> a great many men.
When the English aniient was spread, and v?e bad
fired three guns lo let them know we were friends,
hung out the white flag of truce and so with the
young iriar aad my mao Friday, I went on shore,
au4 who should I see the yery first mao but the Spa-
niard whose life I bad saved; and Friday, who
saw his father at a distance, ran to him with all she
joy imaginable, and embraced him with extreme
te edit ness.
It was the loth of April that I set my soot oa
shore the second time, when my faiibful Spaniard
accompanied by one or more, came up to me ; he
did not know me at first, but when T hinted to him
who I was, no man could express, nor behave him-
self with greater gntutude. He took me by the
band and asked me if I would oot go and take
poiilffioo oi my old habitation, where I found they
had made Considerable improvement. He then sect
the person that attended him lo call his comrades:
I ask*d him several questions and he ?s readily
anfwewd me, telling me withal, what strange con-
fusion the/ had with tbe Englishmen, who designed
to have murdered Them. ..Whilst we were talking
ills man whom we had sent returned with eleven
more. These, "said'he, are some os those that owe
II Jr ling to your gooJnefa. And after he had
made them sensible who I was, they all fluted me
la a very graceful and handsome manner.
Before I relate the history of .the transactions of
my kingdom, as I ha 1 it from th& Spaniard's own
ro^onih; I must here insert whsi 1 omitted in cay
former relation* The matter i» fchis: just before we
Yr'-igbcd anchor to set fail, there happened a quar-
rel on board the strip, whit h had like to have oc~
<a«uooed a second mutiny,nil such time as the £uu«
rageous captain, taking two os the^mo&jffsr&Sory
be laid them in irone, threatningtberb,, *$,iiey were
cooccrned in the former disorders, to have fhem
hanged In England lor running away with the ship.
This frighed some of the reU, as thinking the cap-
taia would serve them in the setae manner,, tho* ht
seemed to give them good vrotds for :he present.
But the ma e having intelligence of this, made me
acquainted with their fears, so that to make them
mmt easy, and ourselves more safe from their con-
(piracies; I w*s obliged to go down and pafo my
honour's ward for it, dm upon ihtir good 'behavi-
our, all that was passed should be pardoned , in tes-
timony of which, I ordered the two men's iron* tq
be taken off, and themselves forgiven. But as this
bad brought us to an anchor that night, in which
ihere was a calm, the % min that had been in irons
dole each of them a musket, aad some other wea-
pons, and taking the (hip's pinnace, not yet haul*
ed up, they ran away to their brother rogues. The
next morning we sent the Jong boat, with' men t<»
pursue them, but all in fain : the mate in revenge
would ba^c- demolished my littl* castle^ burnt i s
furniture, and destroyed their plantations, but hav^-
ing no ori'ers for it, he did not pat it in execution.
And tbua there "were five englishœen in the ifl^.nd
which caused great differences, at my faitbhd Spa-
niard gave me a perfect account of in (be foilowiag
manner.
The Spaniard's Relation, of what happened jri
the Island, from my Departure, till my second
Landing.
X/ OU may rjmci^er, fir, y^p^t^ne n'n a voy-
X ^ge^ Jtnd indeed, I was tibt at Bltls s«rjtti*ff4
lo £ud at my return that you bad lest as. We had
a very good passage, and my countrymen, were
overjoyed to find I had so miraculously escaped;
and when I had shewed the arms and ammunition
which I had brought, they were transported to the
last degree. Aster a tittle stay, we got what we
could from the savages, made bold with two of
their caooes, aod so came, all of us over to the is-
land, where we had no sooner landed, but we
fouod the Englishmen had quarrelled with one ano-
ther, and had attempted to murder and destroy
their fellows, and were often very near putting
their wicked practices in execution.
One day it happened, that as two of my Span*
iards were in the wood, one of the soberest of the
Englishmen came up So them, an4 made heavy
complaints how cruelly they were'used by their
countrymen, and that if we did noi take them under
our protection, and give them, assistance, they must
inevitably be starved and uodonc. When they came
to supper, obc of the Spaniards in a gentle and
friendly manner, began to reprehend the mutinous
Englishmen, that it was a great pity their emu try.
mea should perish, and therefore entreated them to
suffer their countrymen to procure their substslence,
without further disturbance; to which they replied;
Jatt them starve and be damned, for the island was
theirs, and if they did* not work for"them, they
should have no share ia it. Come fays Atkins, Jack,
who shall dare to build in our domink nwithout
our consent? And as we afterwards found our,
they would certainly have murdered them, if ihey
had not been prevented: however, they pulled
down tbair huts, and did them all the damage they
possibly eduJdt l^fiect they had <Jon.* ibi* villainy*
they ea«e back to the castle, boasting of what
they done, and telling one of the Spaniards, tfeat
they must expect the fame treatment, if we dSidooi
mead our manners. This quarrel in a (ho l time
grew so high, that if he had not timely interposed,
& taken away theit arms, ia all probability there
had been murder.
The wicked fellows perceiving that they had
made us all their ermines, began to relent and to
beg for their arms, but this we positively refused
which made them so mad and desperate, that they
lest us in the greatest passion imaginable. They
were hardly ^one, but ilieir two countrymen came
to us with their complaints, telling u*. Tl ey w<re
ruired ; and truly sir, we cculd not help think-
ing h very hard, that nineteen of us should from
time to time, be pulled and insulted by ihrce such
notorious villains. It was -with some difficulty
we perfuaderi their two countrymen from pursuing
them, and killing them wiih their fire-arms; but
upon promise that they should have justice done
them, they desisted. About five days after, be-
ing almost staived, they came to us in a very sub-
missive disposition., and begged heartily lo have
their arms restored, which, upon certain conditions
was at lall granted But f»great was their vilUny,
that they h*id not them «*bove three days when they
began their old trade. And now it was that an ac-
cident happened, that net only obliged us to lay a-
side all private animosities, but likewise to provide
for our mutual security.
One night ?s I lay i» my bed, I was disturbed
with unusual fears and apprehensions I got up and
related the matter to one of my Spanish friends,
vtbotslldmrfuGhhtats wcr« ooy#cflighted

advised iftc to look out carefully ; adding that there
was some mischief on the stocks. Accordingly we
went up to the top of a mountaio, where we disco-
vered a light and beaidthe voicees of several men,
Wiich terified ut exceedingly. We cauld got tell
what to conjecture, and therefore sent cut old Fri-
day as a spy* to fee if he could learn who and from
whence they were, who returning in a very short
time, brought us word, That they were two differ-
ent parties of two different cations; and (hat after
a bloody battle, they had landed there by mere ac-
cident, & in all probability, as soon as it was light
a bloody battle would eafu?. Old Friday hid hard-
ly ended his relaiion, but an unusual noise gave
us to understand, that the engagement was begun,
and nothing could be more bloody anil obstinate,
nor men of more invincibly spirits, nor more ac-
tive and ready i« their way of sighting.
We were undoubtedly, fir, In great consterna-
tion, lest they should run into our grove and de-
stroy what we bad, and so resolved to put ourselves
upon our defence, and (Loot the first that should
approach : and as we app;abanded se it happened;
for three of the army that wera vanquished, came
to the place for (belter; but these I would not suf-
fer to be alain ; but bad them surprized and taken
alive and to truth they all proved very excellent
servant!, and where of great use to ua afterwards.
The two parties being off, and the coast clear, we
went to the place of battle, where we found 32
dead upon the spot, with several bows aud arrows,
and other forts of weapons, which I ordered to be
carefully picked up, and carried into our armory.
This dismal spectacle had tbat effect upoa the 3
troublesome £pgli&aien, that œuc& of tfc«r wary!/
* I
X 3* >
t«mper began to abate, aod they resolved lo be good
friends, and to think unanimously, what was best
to be dooe for our mutual security and preservation?
And accordingly all bands went to wor k to str engih.
*n the fortifications of our ca (lie, and provide a
proper security for our provisions, and indeed we
did both, witk all the caution that the nature of
cur circumstances would allow. And tbua for two
years we lived in a comfortable retirement, baring
neither seen or heard any thing of any of tht sava-
ge* for all that time.
But now there happened another quarrel, which
might have proved of bad consequence, if it had
Dot been prevented ia tiro*:. The 5 wicked En-
glishmen being the aggressors. I oidered them to
be disarmed, and left the case to be determined
by ihe two Englishmen, who sentenced them to be
feasged, alledging among other things, that they
bad a design 10 murder in, and only deferred it to
a proper oppertunrty: upon which I a&ed At-
kins (who was the ring leadrr) what we had done
so them to deserve to be murdered? Or what he
bad to say for himself, why we should not immedi-
ately kiilbim, who had formed such a vilainous c!e-
•fign to murder iw. lo truth, tie Engli&mfco pies-
fed very hard to bang one of them for an example:
the other two : but this I would by no mesas con-
sent to, upon tbe consideration thatl owed my life
to an englisliraau, to you, sir, my bell and only
preserver; however to put it out of their power
to do us any further mischief, we determined that
for the future they should have no arms of any
fort and that if they did again attempt to give the
society any manner-of disturbance, tbat then we
mmli immediately &ooi like wild betf t#
after this sentence was passed, which was general!^
approved I ordered tiem some provisions for their
prere at subsistance, and appointed them a place in a
remote part ol the island, where they might plant,
Sc make what improvement* they thought proper.
They had lived 6 months in this separate condi-
tion, and got in their first harvest, which that (ea~
son was but very small, by reason they were
naturally not only very Lie, but had every
thing to begin anew, and what was still worse,
wei e but very indifferent workmen at the best. These
se iIowa lived thus for above $ quarters of a year*
when growing desperate and weary of working, a
new wbiou came into tlieir beads which might
have been of fatal consequence. Nothing would
serve iktm h seems, but they must seeds make ay
voyage to the continent, to try if they could seize
some os these savages, and make them staves tod*
their druilgery; and indeed the project was not
so preposterous if they had not been actuated
wicked notions and designs-
One moroiog they came to their Iknilt, desiring
to speak with us ; which being granted, they told
us, they were weary of that state ot life, and if we
would give them one of our canoes, tuey would go>
seek their fortune. You may be sure, sir, we were
not a liitie glad to be freed from such troublesome
companions; however we represented to them the
danger of it ^ but finding nothing would change
their rcfoluiioo, we consented they should have
one os our canoes, and at the fame time gave them
frene sue arms, ammunition and provision $ and so
soon as they had fitted out their boat, they merrily
failed away, the fp*niard3 at the fame time calling *
alter them aud wishing them a good Toyogt*
And 1st truth, nothing could be farther from our
thoughts, than the possibility of feeing their faces
any more ; and yet a uaoath scarce had passed, hut
ose of our Englishmen, btlng abroad at work, saw
three men well armtd comiog towards him ; upon
which away he flies to bring intalligence, telling
ui, we were all undooe, for there were men upon
the island that were do savages. While we were
considering the eveat, up came the 3 Englishmen,
H»vhoai we presently knew by their voices ; and now
our wonder eaasiog, our nexi enquiry was into the
nature and manner of their voyage, and the reason
<5f their so speady return, all which one os them
gave in the following manner.
Aster two days fail, we reached land, but
finding the inhabitants savage*, and comiijg with
their bows and arrows to give us an unwelcome re-
caption, we thought better t« make the best of our
•way* steering Northward, In our passage we dis-
covered several little islands, which seemed to be
inhabited; at one of which we resolved to go at all
hazards, which we accordingly did, at one that
l*y the most to the westward. Here we found the
natives very courteous to us, giving us what they
could procure. Among these hospitable Indians
tve stayed several days, enquiring by signs, what
nation lay near them, and were informed that taere
were several savag* nations that lay nigh to them,
that were accustomed to eat mankind; but for
their parts, they were not accustomed to eat
such sort os diet, except such as they look in
battle, We enquired how long it was since they
had a battle, and whether they had now any prison-
ers ? to which they made answer it was oot above
months, and thtir king had now zoo prisoners,
which he reserved for the slaughter. Mighty desi-
rous we were to fee these prisoners, which they
mistaken, thought we wanted some for our owa
use, aud made signs lo us, chat at the next rising of
the fun, we should have some; and accordingly
at the very time, they brought us 11 men aud 5
wooien, jufl as so many cows and oxen are brought,
to a sea-port town to vicinal, a sight that gave us
a great deal of horror* and what to do we could not
te)l: to refuse them we know would be an unpar-
donable affront, and to dispose of them we knew
not how. However, we resolved to accept of
them, and gave them in return a few fishes that
we had in the canoe, and so taking our leave, we
sailed to die ntxi island, where we set 8 of the mea
at liberty; with the rest we made the best of cue
way to ihe iilaad; and though we treated them a&
well as we could, we could by no means convince
them, but they were 10 be killed aod devoured.
Thus, sir, did these 3 desperadoes conclude thefc
narative. Here I a iked them where thry had
lodged their new family being very desirous ta
s*e ttam. They told me they were at their hut £
and so taking Friday's father with us, we all Went
to fee these poor creatures.
When we arrived at their hut> they all fat stark
ualted expecting their fatal tragedy j there were
3 lusty comely young men, well shaped with flrait
and fair limbs between thirty aou five and thirty
years old; and five women, two of whom might
be from thirty to tony, two more not above four
and twenty, and the la It, a comely tall maiden of
above seventeen* Indeed all the women were very
agreeable, both in proportion and features, except
being twaay, which their modes! behavior. aat&
other graces m?Ac amends for, when they after-
wards came to be clathsd. Their naked appear-
ance, with the misery of their condition, was no
very agreeable spectacle* Now it was that I or-
dered Friday's father logo and fry if he could learn
any thing from fhem and if fhey could understand
him, and assure them that they should not be sa-
crificed but not being of his nation, he could on-
ly make one ef the women to understand, and that
•was only by signs too. When they were told by
ihe woman their interpreter that they were not to
be killed, no man can express the strange gestures
by which they expressed their joy; and when they
"were asked whether they were willen to be ser-
vants, they made joyful signs to express their readi-
ness. But now sir, having women among u«>
which I was apprehensive at some time or other
raigbt occatron quarrel?, J asked the 5 Englishmen,
how they proposed to dispose of their families? ad-
ding, that I was not going to lay any restraints up-
on them, only I would desire that they would take
each but one; and after they had chosen which
they had a mind to, no other man should presume
lo touch her. Well this they all agreed to, and
so they concluded so'draw lots for ;he choice,
which beyoad expectation, they did with regularity
and exactness : the only thing that's observable, is,
hat the poor women, vl) old Friday had convin-
ced them to the contrary, were under the most ter-
rible apprebentions, that as the Englishmen took
them away, 3s their lots directed, they were imme-
diately to be murdered.
But these frights and terrors being removed, the
Kngli/hmen with their new wives went to work, and
ia a rery siiorl time tad stBislbed sereral huU, pro*
per for their living. Aid now fir, I coxae to lay
before you a scene quite different from any thing
that has beea related. One morning very early,
there came 5 canoes of Indians on Hi ore, upon the
old account of devouring- their prisoners, all that
we had to do was to lie concealed till their bloody
ceremony was over, and to take proper measure*
to defend ourselves in cafe of need, but notwith-
standing ail our caution, there happened an uu-
happy disaster that had like to have •tcasioned the
utter desolation of the island ; for after the sova-^
ges were gone off, u&y Spaniards and I looking out
to make observations, we found 3 savagea that had
over gorged themselves lying fast afleep upon the
grouod: what to do with them at first, we could
not tell : to murder them we thought would not
be justifiable according to the laws of Christianity,
having no previous quarrel with them : at length,
we thought it most advisable to secure them alive
and set them about some work or other, till we
could dispose os them; and accordingly we took
them prisoners, and carried them fLst <o cur castle,
and then to the two English, who soon found them
employment; but for wanfos keeping a strifl guard
over them ; one of them got away ioto the woods,
and was not heard «»f for several days.
This unluckv accident gave us great apprehensi-
ons, that, by some way or other, this savage would
siad'rneans to get bitohis own country* and inform
his own countrymen how weak we were, and con*
sequently that: they would come over and destroy
us al!, nor indeed were our notions iIl-grotindedt
for in 8 months after, there came 6 cocoes, with lo
men ia each, aud lauded wiihia lufa tlmo a mile of
the Englishmen's habiiation, who, with the greatest
terror imaginable, lei tbeir milch Goats loose into
the woods, and ran to their secret cave, resolving
to defend themselves till we should come to their
assistance*
It was not long before we could perceive thiir
hibitatiou in flu nits, and the savages in pursuit oi
them in several parties; upon which they took their
stand at a convenient place* and determined to de-
fend themselves to the very last extremity. Whilst
they,were thus expecting them, the savages came
up ; one of them was the runaway, who had bsen
the cause os all this mischief, and he they resolved
should he the first that suffered, let what would be
thecoiisequeoce; and accordingly as it wasc^ucert-
ed, the first let fly, aud indeed he bad taken his
aim so well, that he killed the foremost outright,
shot the runaway through the body> and wounded
the third.
Sad and dreadful was the outcry, the wounded
Indians made Being quite insensible from whence
thdr sudden destruction came, aud, as we were
lofermed, believed that they were destroyed by
thunder and ligrnning, haviug never before heard
or seen any thing like a gun ; while they were in
this consternation, the Englishmen had time to new
load their guns, and firing both together upon a-
nother party of 5, who were standing by the 2 that
were wounded, they all fell to the ground, as if
they had been killed : upon which the two English-
men went up to them without charging their guns,
which was a very wrong step: for when they cams
up they sound four or five alive, three of them
siigtly wounded, and one of them not at all, then
they were forced to take the but end of fhffr
anftets, and knock them on their head, and took
him that was not wounded and bound him, and
laid him it the foot of a ttee hard by> and then
made all the haste they c$uld towards the car*, lo
fee if all wa* well there ; and finding every thing
safe they came back to the tree where they left the
Indian bound, and found to their great surprize,
he was gone ; and now they were in greattr fear
and coufufion than before , but while they were
conGderisg what was to be done, seven of the Spa-
niards came up to their assistance, bringing wijb
them that very Indian the two Englishmen had left
bound under the tree, whom the Spaniards had re-
leased ia their way.
This great rainforcemtot so much encouraged
the two Englishmen and so great waa their indig-
nation for the loss of their huts, that they would
(lay no longer ; but taking the Spaniard* with them
all well armed, away ib*y went in pursuit of the
rest of the savage g, but to no purpose, for from a
rising ground they perceired that taey were got
on board their canoe*, and were got out to sea too
far to.be come at; which gave them nsw matter of
fear aud apprehension, least they should go home
directly and inform their brethren of all that had
fell out, aid incite them to come over with a greater
power, and destroy the whole island, iknd as we
judged, so it happened : for in less than 7 months
they came over with 25 canoea, and landed upon
us wnh 250 men, all well armed with bows and
arrows, and other formidable weapons.
You may imagine, sir, we were In no small con-
flematioa upon the approach of these unwelcome
guests; nor were w* wanting to make the best pre-
parations we could to defend ourselves, we -uaud
®ur faithful slaves in the best manner we could
nor would our women be persuaded from fighting
along with us, bemg resolved to conquer, or die
with their husbands, whom they now loved with
the greatest tenderness and passion* Of this link
army, I was the commander in chief, and WiJl
Atkins, whom I knew to be a fellow of invincible
•oarage* I appointed my lieutenant-general, and
gave him 6 choice men well armed, to command
as a separate body. In a very short time the fight
began on Atkin's quarter, who ordering this men
to sire in the thickest of ihem, never were crea-
tures in greyer tenor and confusion, as irnagUiing
their ded uction to proceed from the God's ; and
if Atkir s had obeyed my orders, and retreated un-
perceived, they had fled to their canoes without
sny further attempt, but perceiving of him and his
small number,, they came on again with the great*
est fury.
In short we were forced to Interpose with our
wh«!e body to save Atkins and his party, who were
pressed very hard and had one of the English men
killed by his side, and himself wounded. We
g«*ve three vollits, but they were grown now so
desperate, that notwithstanding0111, sire, they came
up to the very teeth of us insomuch, that we were
forced to retire likewise ; and in truth I am will-
ing to own,, that if the night had sot given u» a
little respite, we must have been in a great deal of
danger. As soon aapossible, I drew up my little
a«my on a rising grouod, where by the light of
the moon, we could observe the savagts in a great
deal ot disorder ; upon which we concluded it
would be the best to fall oa them now/aud if pot
fible toglve themavolly undiscovered, which we
did by the guidance of the (wo Englishmen that
knew ibe ground perfectly ; aster this we gave
them 3 ?ollies more> and then rushed ih upon them
with our swords, & with such irresistable furr that
they gave waY, aud making a dismal howling ani
screaming they betook themselves to their heels.
Many of them were kilkd in the flight, but we were
so exceedingly tired with fighting these 2 battles,
that we did not then pursue them to their canoes
in which we concluded they would immediately get
to sea ; but there happened a dreadful 11 or in, they
were prevented, and many of their canoes were lost
into the bargain.
After we had taken some refreshcncnMod a lit-
tle repose we resolved, as soon as it wa* light to
go to the place of battle, in order to make what
observations we could ; and coming at length to a
full view of the remainder ot their army, we found
them lying in a most miserable posture ; and when
we came within musket- shot, I ordered two guns
to be fired, in order to try if they had any notion of
coming to another engagement: and the project
answered so effectually, that they no sooner heard
the report of the first gun, but they all started up,
ancl in a most astonishing manner, ran away to the
mountains; tho' I confess, I had much rather the
weather would hare suffered them to have gone
off without giving us any more trouble \ for now
the cafe was, what must be done with this great
number of savage ordatures? Great was our d*~
bates on this point:however, after mature con Ode-
ration, it was determined to destroy their canoes,
which when they &w they made the most hideous
•ufccrfet| but to no purpose; foe we either burned
«r entirely destroy**! them all, wsuch whea
they saw, they ran about for a considerable
time ; aod as the had no arms, nor any materials
to make any, fa notwithstanding their numbers we
Were the less apprehensive of being surprised by
them* ladeed our stock of provisions were so
very small, that Ire came to a resolution to driW
them up into some remote corner of the island* and
to kill as many of them as we could catch, in order
to lesson their number, and then to give the remain-
der some com te plant, &c. Pursuant to this reso-
lution, we pursued them with -our gum, killing
every day one or more, till at length their rmmbtrs
was so reduced, that wt concluded, if poffible* in
lake one as them alive, which at last watt some dif-
ficuUy we effected; and using bim kindly, we
brought him to old Friday, who told him if they
would^ submit and do what they were commanded,
they should be used well, otherwise they should be
. ail slain, aud he bid him go and assure his compa-
nions of it, who were in the most miserable stam-
Ing condition that could be imagined*
The poor creatures who were now reduced ta
37 in tbewhoje, received thi* offer with all the joy
that might bee; so we sent them some food, which
they ea* with great thaakfulnesj, and made ut-all
the promises wu could desire; and to %ht them,
their due, they have never broke any of tbsm to;
this day. And thus, sir according to the;be$t of
my ability, I have given you an account of what
w most material that has happened ia thir i%\mi

THERE is do doubt to be made but that the
Spaniard fpvc mt a faithful account, which
was exceedingly agreeable to me, and no less sur-
prizing to the youDg priest, and to all the rest that
heard it; nor were these people less pleased with
the necessaries I brought th«m, which were a migh-
ty help to them in perfecting their habitations.
Will Atkins was now grown a vary sober man and
had fixed up his hut with exquisite curiosity. In-
deed , nothing considering the circumstances and
the nature of the place, could be finished with
greater curiosity, kept more neat, or have better
conveniences. For the habitations of the English-
men were by much the most commodious in the iuV
and. As to religion they had little among them; and
the m*n only taught tJactr wive* to speak English;
they were all fiuhful enough, and bore a child once
a year, fooie of which were now 6 years old, and
very strong and healthy.
When I enquired of the Spaniards concerning
their manner oi livtDg among the savages, they
gave me 3 very deplorable relation oi it ; adding,
that they had hardly any hopes of support, or of In-
jure deliverance. Many were the methods that we
took to intlruct the savages, but to no purpose 5 for
ihe Usages, ignorant as they wtre, could j<ivc 00
ear to the iosnuctioos of those who owed t! em their
lives. And at the returnof their friend, whem they
thought* had been devoured, their joy \ra$ t&ceciKing
great, especially when they saw the loaves of brea3
which I fewt them; but whet* (hey beard the errand,
and perceived the bait, their transports were i a ex-
pressible This was the account I had from them:
and now it follows, I (h#uld inform the reader what
I did for them and in what condition I left them.
As it was generally agreed that they should
liave uo disturbance from the savages, so I told
them I had made this voyage chiefly for their fakes,
and as I was not come to remove them, but rather
to establish them and fix them upon the island, and
that for that end? I had brought them all forts of
necessaries and artificers, with other persons, that
would not only add to their number, and conse-
quently to their defence} but would likewise be a
mutual help and support to them: they were all
together when I talked to them after this manner,
J asked them one by one if they had entirely for-
got their former animoGtics, and would engage in
the strictest friendship? to which Will Atkins re-
plied, That they had aflliction* enough to make
them all solitary, and enioiies enough to make
them friends; adding withal, That he had most
justly deserved the treatment he had received from
the Spaniards, a«d th<u he was only to blame in
she affair; upon which the Spaniards replied,
That Gncc Will Atkins had upon all occasions be-
haved himself so valiantly in their common de-
fence, ail that was past should be utterly forgot-
ten 4 that he should have bis arms, and be made
At next commander to the governor*
Upon these kind declarations of mutual love and
frieadAip,. we concluded to dine together on the
morrowj which vre did in the best order and for*
m«Hty# which ihe mature oi the place would per-
mit, and after that, I distributed to every one os
them his portion of the necessaries I had brought
over, and then divided the island into three dis-
tinct colonies, making my old habitation the me-*
tropolis, which the Spaniards inhabited.
The yong man whose mother was starved to
death, as was before mentioned, and the maid,
who was indeed a very pious, virtuous young wo*
mao, feeing the good difpoGtion o; affairs, drop*
ped their resolution of going to the East-Iodias,
and both desired I would permit them to stay up-
on the island, and enter them among my subjects;
which I readily agreed to, placing them with the
Englishmen, where they lived comfortably; and
the youn^j woman was afterwards married, as will
appear in the ft que I of the story.
And now I come in course to speak of the young
French Priest, wbese pious behaviour and excellent
discourse were extremely agreeable, and deserve
a particular observation.
One mofoing he came tome as I was going to
the Englishmen's plantation, aad addressed h?n*self
to me in the following manner: I know you have
nothing more at heart than the prosperity of this
island ; and as the blessing of God is the only means
to procure that prosperity, I humbly submit it to
your wisdom and goodness, whether some corrupt
practices now amonsj us ought net to be removed;
continued he, I must confess, I look upon it to be
a great unhappinefs, that we differ in some points
of religion; yet we both believe and worship tht
fame God, who having laid us down several stated
rules of obedience, we ought not knowingly trans-
gress them. Here are in the island four Englishmen
that have cohabited with savage women, and have
\ued tbtmas their wives, which can be nothing less
1 bap' ad u Ifety in the moil literal fenfe, it belsg.well
known to you, and to all the rest of the inhabitants

torious liberty? And can ypu with reason expect a
blefltngupon the inland, whiift soeb corrupt practi-
ces continue with unpunity, and men are perait-
ted to H ve in such an openjtafe of adultery? It is

knowledge ; but now,the cafe is entirely altered;
and 1* you neglect ,the> remedy, die guih will lie

fess, that I thought he meant I should separate
them:; but therein he quickly;un4eceired me,, by
tellingme hisaneaoing was not that I flbould fepa-
rare them, but rather link them faster^ toget her by
marrying them. The piety and sincerity of the'
man if are me a great deal ofsatisfaction, itisooiucri
that 1 promised iilca I wouB instantly go aoddif-
•couisc with them, and use ray beft end«avou.s with
them, ihat every thing- might be done according
in his direction. ., r
- When we came to the Englishmen,I a{k«dlthern
concerning their manner of living with the fa-
» srage women; abiding ho> , scandalous it was to
lire ipfuch at) open and continual couise.of adul-
tery. To which Atkins replied, that he beHeved;
the savage women;they li$ed wi b, to be the most,
inuoeeni people in the farfd, and jhat they would
- never forsake !bem, and to confirm me they xmt£.
fmp:z$% hc7tokl me if there wa* a clergyman in
the Jhip, they .would be married to theni witb *H

which ihey all agreed so, and^so the thing was
accordingly done to thejr mutual satisfaction ; ob
whieli I gave Atkins a Bible and requested his
initriH^jng wife smd family in the principles of
his religion. .'
«The.a&hs- of the island being thus fettled, I
was preparing every ihing for going? da board,
when the young nsaD, whose mother bad. heetr
barred, as before mentioned, .come to mej: {'ayidf,
he understood there was a clergyman d^Jbtujatd
that bad married titeEnglistimen and the savsge?>
he had a match to prdptje between iwAchristjau^

And now ha ring disposed every thing in the
i(iand in the best manner pofljble, and giving she
people assurances, that I would always hate them
ki my thoughts and wculd be sure to send them
proper supplies as often as I bad an opportunity,
upon the sicst of May 1695, I set fail for the Bra-
fits; bat the r.ext day we were becalmed, and
lookiog towards the N N. E. of the island, we
could perceive something out at sea looking very
black, upon which the mate, going up the /hrouds
& taking a view with a perspective glass cried out.
It was ao army. Ao army, fays I, you fool, bow
can that be? N:y, sir, fays he, do not be id a pas-
sion, for lean assure you, il is not only au army,
but a fleet too, and they are making ail the speed
they can towards rs. As they came nearer towards
us, they seemed to be very much surprized at the
sight of our /hip, not knowing what to make of
us, a; d our men been unwilling they should come
too Dear made signs to them to keep off, which
they did 5 but as they retired they let fly several ar-
rows, by which one of our men was wounded.
In a Jiule time they bad the courage to come so
near us c at they ccu^d hcarus fpeake; upon which
I ordered Fiida) 10 call to them to know what they
would have, u| on which they poured a wh; le
cloud of arrows upon him, seven of which went
quite through hi* body; and so I lost ray Uithful
servant, and my moll aOeclionate companion ia
all my affliclfo *s and solitude. I w*s so enraged
at the death of poor Friday, that I ordered the gun-
ner to load with some small shot, an immediately
give them a broadside, which he did ib effectually
that thirteen or fourteen of their canoes were over-
set, and the rest so frighteaed, that away they flew-
with all the speed they could; but our men ?ook
one poor wretek about au hour afterwards, as be
Was swimming for his life; but the creature waa-
so stuboru and surly, ifcut I could oot prevail on
him eiiher to eat or drink; upoo which I ordered
them to throw 1 vim in the sea, by which means,
after we had taken him up the second time he came
so far to himself, that he let us know that they
were going with their kings to fight a great battle j
and when wea&td him, what made him come to
us, aod (hoot at us-? All the answer be could
make u', was, That they only came to wonder
at us i Poor Friday was buuei with all the pomp
and decency our circumstance* would allow. And
now having a fair wind, we made the best of Our
way to the Brasilca, and in a very few days came-
to anchor in the bay of AU Saint* With some
difficulty I got on (bore with part of my cargo,
and having fitted out a vessel with provision for
my islands and fettled several' matters with my
correspondent, we set fail for the East-Indies.
When we failed from the Brafih* we made di-
rectly to the cape of Good Hope, having a tolera-
ble good voyage, steering most part S. E. At the
cape we only took in fresh water, and then foiled
directly to the coast of Coiomandel. The first place
we touched at wa* the island of Madagascar, where
though the People are fierce and treacherous, yet
for some time they treated us well, and gave us
some commodities. I made it my chief business to
go on shore as often as I could, to make obfervati-*
ens, and indeed the people traded with us with Co
much seeming civilityt th&t some of tb% mtnteiolv- #
ed one aigtbt to stay on shore in atent, which they
made for (hat purpose; but for my part, I and
some of the rest thought it more safe to lye io the
boat, from whence about two o'clock in the morn-
io, we were alarmed wiih the firing-of guns, and
our tneji crying out for help or they should all be
murdered.
The occasion of thh fray, as we afterwards on*
derstood from lome of them that made their escape
was this : Ad old woman thai fold milk, brought
with her a young woman chat fold herbs, who when
the sailors (aw they laid hold of her, and carried her
among the trees ; upon which the old one made
such a prodigious out cry, that both men and wo-
men coose running to their assistance. At the be-
ginning, the fellow th.it began ths fray was killed
with a lanes, though at first we did oot know what
was become of him. A night or two after we resolv-
ed to go onshore, & try if we could find out the man
ti>at was missing. An hour before midnight we
land*** at the place where the action began, but it
was so dark, w« could discover nothing till the
boatswain fell over one of the dead bodits, *e
concluded to stay there till morning, when we dis-
covered two and thirty dead bodies lying <<n tS>«
ground, w! e>eof two were not dead. HUv.ng
made this discovery, I thought I had seen en ugh,
aud so wai preparing to return on board, but the
boatswain and the rest, which were about twenty,
resolved to go to the Indian town, to tty it -they
could find out what wai become of Jeffs;es their
companion-
I opposed this resolution a* toodaogerou to be
undertaken; but all I could fay signified nothing;
^they were resolved to go, let the consequence be
what it wauld. It was doi witho-u!.difficulty that
thryiouod the town, which consisted of about two
hundred bfrofcs where the people being'in a pro-
found deep the sailors concluded to divide them-
selves int.) tl tee bodies* ^od kt the town on site,
in three places at once, and to kill al! that should
attempt to escape and to pluuder (he rest. Hav*
ing made (his desperate resolution, to work (hey
vent, but they had not gone tar, but the first com-
pany fuuud J heir companion Dick .jeffr.'cs, strip-
ped iiirk naked, with hi* throat cui (roni ear to e r
hanging by one arm upon a tree. In ahculead-
joioiiig to tilts tree, they found fifteen or sixteeo
iodians.
-They immediately set fire to the house, and at
the fame time to several other parts of the town;
so that in a very little time tie whole place v?.<s in
flames, aod no sooner did the affrighted creatures
run to fare themselves from the flaraes, but
the sailors instantly ehher drove them back into
t *e fire, or killed them without mercy. Durirtp;
all this while they never fired a gun, le&lt the
noise should awake the people too saO for them to
destroy.
I was extremely angry with them tor thtis cru-
elty, but particularly with the captain, wh v in-
stead of persuading them to reason, rather prompt-
ed them to farther mischief. As for the teiL they
only boastedj of their revenge, and according to
#heir accounts, they destroyed 153 womea aud
children, and, burned the whele town to allies into
the bargain ; and however our men might value
-themselves upin this bold exploit, I always looked
-upon it with detestation;, and ( ave it the title of
*h%maflkGre cf Madagascar.
When we were under sail, the boatswain would
be oftea magnifying and defending this blooJy ac
tion, which I as often dispraised and coademned,
bidiisg them depend upon it, that God would ne-
ver bles* tbeir royage aster such an nnpar*IJ led
barbarity. Aud as I foieioid, so ft came to pals;
for when we came upon tbc Persian shore, we lost
5 of our men, who venturing too far upon shore,
were.either kill'd or taken and made ftares by she
Arabians. Upon this misfortune I agaio repriman-
ded cbem, advising (hem to repent, upon which,
says the boatswain, you are always disturbing us,
and as you are Out a passenger, we are not oblidged
to bear it; and therefore it you do not forbear for
the future, I am resolved to leave the ship, and
not fail with such dangerom and ung raitfui com-
paay.
All ihh I heard very patiently, heirg sensible,
as casts then stood, I had no remedy, aod indeed
I thought all had been ever and forgot. But so it
happened; we weie now in the road of Bengal,
were going one day on ihore with the supercargo
one os the men caiite to me, and *.«>ld me, I need
not trouble myself to come on ba ud any more,
for «hat le had orders from the boat swain, and the
rest or the officers not to bring me on board any
more.
This insolent message much surprised me ; how-
ever, I made the fellow ne answer, but went to
the supercargo, and desired him to go on board
immediately, aod acquaint the cj plain, that fie
might prevent the mutiny, whicb. I had reason
to apprehend: but before this cor dd be done, tbc
matzer was effected; for I was hf/rdly gone out of
tfœboaVbut the boatswain, guv aim, carps ale**
wish all inferior-officers, came to the quarter*;
deck, defning to speakwith the eaptain ;aod them
the bcwifwaio began torailagaiost me exceeding-
ly, tciiiog hira, if I had not gone od shore myself,
they were itsolved to have compelled me> 10 if.
And fasiher he had the insdknceio add, that if I
had net quilted the (hip, though they had all re-
spect imaginable for the capiaia, and would serve
him with their lives, yet they would ail leave the
Chip immediately; upon which the rest Cried out*
one aod all, one aad all.
Though my oephew wss a man that wanted
neither courage nor resolution, yet thfa unexpect-
ed hehaTiour shocked him exceediagly; he ex-
postulated with them, telling them the danger and
injustice of such a proceeding; but all would not
do, they were hilly resolved tfcat if I came on
board, they would all leave the (hip; upon which)
fays he, if ibis be your resolution, I will go aod
acquaint him with it; aud fj Le came to me, and
told me all thai had passed I am very glad to
see you, nephew, says I, ani am glad it is no
worse: for in *rutb, Icx^ecttd they would have
rebelled against you : I only defuc you send
me my necessary things on shore, and I will fied
my way to England as well as I can. Though
this vexed my nephew to the heart, yet fiadiog
there was no remedy, ht took his leave of me and
Went on board, aodsent me my necessaries, and
so this matter was ended in a very few hours ; and
oow I thiak I was at least a thousand leagues fur-
ther from England than I was at my little king-
dom*
My nephew left me two servants to attend me
who engaged to be with me till my return* I
took lodgings in the house os ao EngiislMnai*,
where were several merchants, &c. And indeed
I liked the company and entertainment so well,
that I continued her* for several months, consid-
ering what course I had better take. I had some
valuable English goods, a thousand piects of tight,
and'a letter of credit lor more, if I fliouid have
occasion. The goods i soon disposed of tqadvao-
and I bought several good diamonds which
I could easily carry about with me.
One morning a merchant with whom I w s vtry
intimate came to me ; fays he, Countryman, I
have a proposal to make to you, which I do net
question will be to our advantages; to be short.
Sir, we arc both in a remote pan of the world,
and far removed from our native country, and yet
/we are in a place where men that understand bu-
siness may get money. Now if you will put >.
thousand pounds to ray tlv-usand pounds, w$ k?!
hav? a ;;ocd (hip; you shall be the captain* and I
the merchant, and we will go upon a trading vo\*>
This proposal soon gained upon me, suiting ex-
actly with my rambling inclination; but it requi-
red some rime bes re we could get a vefltl to bur
raisd or (allots fit. to man her out. In a little
time we procured both, and chose a captain, not
caring for the charge myself, away we sailed lor
China, and had a very prosperous voyage, haviog
not only gained a large sum of mosey, but withal
got a good insight into the traffic of those comnef.
Our next voyage was to the Spice tfla&ds, which
proved likewise very successful; and not Icng af-
ter the merchant and I made up our accounts to
tautual satisfaction; we found ourselves veryrhth.
and aowr ounconccra was to dispose of cur j»oixey«
Whilst we-wtr\i cobfidcriug what was best to be
cicite* it happened that a Dutch ship of about 2oo
tuas, came mto that pott* The meo pretended they
were so UU *bat thtre were sot bao4.s spffictof ^
manage the vefleljth* captain heiog deiksus to go
io Europe, public notice was given that the ihip
was to be fold, which qo sooner came to our ears,
but we bought her, and would hare entertained
'iopie cl the men, but they could sot be found;
for as soon as ever they lud received their divi-
dend* they all went privdKiytoth> Moguls coun-

After we had bought the ship and Sited her with
all frtcefiTrrtes for the voyage, with foise difficulty
and expense, we picked up some sailo*scf differ'
: eat pouottiesy and manned bee ioielabie well, re*

lo this aiaoptr we tiad£d. back waid aad forward

thti y^yage we. met with contrary, wbds, which
; beat ut up aud dowtJ; and oo looser were we
^got clear oi these fugged seas,, but we found our
, ship had fpruog a leak wrhich obliged us to put in-
4*o the riv>r Cambodia, which goes to Siam.
\ Qoeday as I was on Ho*e refreshing myself
, jtbm came to me aa Englishman, that was ^ats to
*#a gast. Iadmman, that rid then lathrftraefait*
Sir, (aya he, you may very well wonder at my
business, who am a perfect stranger to you, but
DotwidislaodiQg that I hare something to impart
to you, that concerns you very nearly, and it is
the emiueiit danger you arc in has brought me
to you ;danger! said I, I kuow of no danger un-
less that hui flap is a little leaky, aud that I bleed
shall be rectified as loon as possible. I believe fays
be, you will find another employment. The town
of Cambodia is about ten leagues higher, and
three leagues on this fide lie three Dutch aud Eng-
lish ships, and will you veuture up farther into
the river, without considering whether you have
force enough to sight them all?
I knew aot what he meot by this discourse, and
turning short upon him, Sir, said I» I kaowof na
reason I have to be afraid either t»t the Dutch or
English, I am no interloper, and what business then
can they have with me? Well, fays the man, If
ay advice is of no weight with you, lake your owq
way: However, I am very sorry you should be
so much an enemy to yourself: I will be plain
with you, unless you »put to sea immediately you
will be attacked by five long boats full of armed
men and hanged yourself for a pirate, if you are
taken ; and Gr, , I thought such a piece of service
deserved better treatment, £h, said I, you shall
not siad me uugrateful; let me beg you therefore to
explain yourself, and I will put to sea immedir ely.
Why then in ibort, the matter is this, y#u knew
ery well, that your captain, with three of his rnen>
were killed by the malayans; that you or some
otheis that were on board, ran away with the ship,
and are turned pirates. Now sir, this it in sub-
ihuiG* what I ha?c to say, and Jcao only further
assure you, that isthcy can lay their hands on you
they will ex*cut« you without ceremony.
Sir, said I though no man came more honestly
by tbe fhfp than I did, yet as you represent the
matter, I think I ought to be on my guard, andl
heariily thank you for yuur information. Come
says he, it is no time far ceremonies, if you value
your own, and the lives of your men, get out to
lea as fast as you cao. 1 am very well satisfied,
laid I, in your sincerity, aod the service you have
doae me, pray, therefore, tell me what recom-
p?oce I (hall make you? Only take me with you*
says he, aud if you find what I have told you is ~
true, I refer myself for a secompeosation to your
generosity.
So reasonable did this appear in every particu-
lar, that we went on board directly together, where
we no sooner entered, but my partner welcomed
me with the joyful news that they had slopped the
leak. I am glad of that, fays I, but come, let us
make all the haste we can to weigh anchor; weighs
si*ys he, what is the matter of this hurry? Pray
alk ho questions, said I, put all hands to woik^
without iofmg a moments time: upon which, in
great-surprize the captain was called, who imme-
diately ordered the anchor to be got up; and tho*
the tide was not quite down, yet been aflisted with
a little land bree2e, weJ&ood out to sea : And thea
it was, that calling m^partner into the cabin, I
related the story at large, whiph was confirmed*
and more amplified by the man I b« ought on
board* But scarce had we finished cur discourse
upon this head, but a sailor came to the cabin
door, with a message (rom the captain that we were
chased by five sloops full of armed men. Vsry
well, setd I, I am luify convinced there is some-
thing in*?, ar>d so I wens upon deck, and told the
men that we were in danger of having the ship
seized, ani to be executed, as pirates, and a&td
them if they would faithfully stand by us, aad by
one another? Ta which they unanimously replied,
they would stand by m, and fight for -us to the last
drop of their blood. Then T asked the captain
which way he thought was best to defend ourselves,
who replied, he bcliev;d it was «he safest way to
keep them off with qui grc?t guns, and according-
ly the gu uer was ordered to load the guns with
small shot, aid to bihg them to bear f re and-.ift;
j4i»J thus the deck being cleased, we were in all
points p ep.aed for an engagement.
We stood out to sea, but still the boats followed
us very close* We could perceive ti e two foje-
most were English,' which were ahead of the
Dutch by two leagues ; hereupon we fired a gun
without a ball, intimating that they should bfiug
too, ant! we put out a flag* of true? as a signal of
parky; but finding them crouding after us, till
they came within ihot^ we took in our white and
-hangitg out the red stag, immediately sued at them
with ball; And then we called to them with a
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril to
keep off*
. But all this signified nothing to them, who de-~
pending upon the ctreogttnhat followed them, were
resolutely bent for mischief: Hereupon I ordered
them to bring the ship too, by which me*0s, they
tying upon our broad-fide* we let fly at them fi?c
guns, one of whom carried away the stern of the?
hindermost boat, and obliged them not only X&
sake down their fail, but m^dc them all run tct tbe
head of the boat to keep her frOcb sinking; aDd so
lite lay by baying cQpiigb-of.it ; and ib the rhairi ,
time we prepared to welccrraetbe foreaVost boafik

p^ticufyrly the meaning,o( all thiv, one of the,
Du-tchol^tt whom \ve took up let us into the ic
<&et? Jelling us the fellow we bought the ship tWm^

was an errant thief, and that he ran away with
the stxip 5 but the Captain was treacherously mur-
dered, and that be and four more were forced to
betake themselves to the woods for safety; and
that at length by means of a Dutch vessel fe its
way to China, that came accidentally to take in
fresh water, they were preserved. He further told
us, tfut they weie informed that the fellow fold
the ftip at Bengal and (he was turned pirate, and
had taken federal prizes,
After mature consideration, we concluded it
best for us toreturn to Bengal, where being known.-*
we might best prove how we came by the stjp, and
where we were sure^to meet with some justice, and
not to be hanged first, aud judged afterwards ; but
upon second and more deliberate thoughts, we all
agreed that by passing by Batavia we ran too great
9 hazard, and therefore we'determined to change
our course, aod fail towards the coast of China,
and there dispose of the ship, and then get ano-
ther, and make the best of our way to Europe.
This being generally agreed to, we steered away
N N. E, but meeting with contrary winis, w^hkh
blew bard against us, our voyage grew very trou-
blesome and tedious, aud our provisions almost ex-
baufleJ, and what wps still worse, we were ap-
prehensive, that the /hips, whose boats we had
bundled so rudely, eaigfk be jsl ibe road before us,
which fa consequence, must be fatal to us- Upon
these melancholy considerations, we again resolved
to chjnge our coarse,'and try, if possible we
could not make some harbour belonging to the Por-
tugueze. With this resolution, we let forward to
the bay of Tonquin, in order to fail from thence
to Macao, a town once possessed by the Portuguese
and where there were still many European fami-
lies.
We came in sight t>f ibis place earljMhe next
morning but coufidsring our former circumstances,
We put into a small river, till we had enquired,
what (Lips we had in our road, and how matters
sti Ovl r and indeed this prudent step was the cause
of our happy deliverance: for the n.xt morn*
}<sg ti ere came in two Dutch (hips and a third
Without any colours; and in the evening two En-
glish onrs.
The fiver where we lay wu but small, the
couatry wild and barbarous, and the inhabitant&
all robbers, having no coirespondence with any
other nation: and among other barbarious customs
they have this particularly: That when any (hip
U drives upsvn the coast, they immediately seize
her, and make all her me* slaves, that we here
found ourselves surrounded with coeniies both by
sea and land.
As we found our ship was very foul and leaky,
we thought to cleaoce her in this place; but while
Viis wm doing, the inhabitants, who, I believe^
had never seen a ship upon the Careen before.,, and
not perceiving our men* who were at worlfc, they
presently imagined that the ship bad been cast a-
way, and lay on the ground, and accordingly they
surrounded us viith 5 or 6 targe boats lull of arm-
ed men, with a resolution to plunder the ship, and
carry the men away slaves to their king ; bui *vhe'a
l^ey saw our men at work upon the outside of the
ship, they looked upon us with the greatest confu-
sion imaginable; neither could we imagine what
their design was, but however to pievem'rie worst
we harfded down font: arms, and indeed it wan
well we did, for in Jesi.tban a quarter of an-hour-)
they came scouring upon us with all their force.
Indeed we lay but in aa ill posture to receive
them, and before the men could come on board,
they had seized one of the sailort, but (he fellow
loon'disengaged himself, and killed the Pagan that
Si 11 laid hold oo him f however, Vna was itttie to
the purpose, considering their number, a«d I ie^l-
1/ believe if it had not been for a lucky acciJ^nt,
we lud been all lost. The thing was this..-the
carpenter who was stopping the holes in the (hip,
had got two kettUa, the one full of boiling pitch,
aod the ofher with rosin, tallow, &c. and as two
or three infiJclt w#re entering the boat, the c«r-
pcaierVmaic saluted them with a ladle lull of
boiling liquor, which had such an effect, that be-
ing half naked, it made them roar, and leap into
the sea; when the carpenter perceived this, he
took his mop, and dipping it into the pitch kette,
he so sprinkled it among them, that they all ran
frighted away, crying and howling in the moti ter-
rible manner.
I must own I w.4S extremely pleased at the edd-
nefs of this adventure; however we loft no ' time
to pin us in a posture of defence, and «s soon as
we could, we put to sea again, being sesorved to
put into the first tradiog port we came near. As-
ier some day* s*il, we came in sight of (bore, 3nd
standing in, a boat came off to us with an old Por<
tugueze pilot-on hoard,who olieiing us his service,
we v:>ry g.U.Jly accepieJ is, and sent the boat back
again 5 in sttort the old man went with us, ^.;d*i6
wc.iarled along, I alked him if there were fMV^-i?
rates in the 'cas ? he tuld me he had not heard
a *y one thai had been in these seas tor many yeajs
except one that was seen m the bay of Siam, about
a ctfenth ago; oor was (bebuUtfbr a ruoncr nei-
ther, bat only a stiip that the men bad run away
with, the captain having been murdered by the
Malayans ;and I can tel! you this, if some Dutch-
men that came pretty near him the other day, in
the riser Cambodia, had laid their hands upon
them, they would have hanged every one of the
rouges upon the yard arm without any further ce-
icmopy.
Being feasible that this old pilot could do us no
haro>, 1 told him how casts stood with us, and
dilired hisj to carry us to Nanquin, where neither
English nor Dutch ships came. Says the old n:an
you have taken the right course to steer to the
north; and if I might ad?ife, I would have you
feii (be ship at China: But fays I. in doing that I
may betray innocent people; replies he, I know
the Dutch comrnaiulers, and will take care they
(in 11 be lightly informed of the whole mauer.
Whilst these things were under debate, we fetkri
dhtcliy to Nasquin, and in about thirteen days
came to an anchor iu the entrance into the Gulf*
where we were informed that iwo large Dutch
(hips were gone beiose us, ai d that we should cer-
tainly fall into their haed-. What to do we ceula
not tell, but the old man told us there wafca tittle
harbour about forty leagues to the south witfd, and
if we could get thither, at no Du4ch or Engiilh.
ftdps ever came there, we might be fase. This ad-
vice was generally approved,, and thither, by the
honest pilot's direction, we arrived in safety: A lite
fife days failing, we went directly fafco the pott,
and landed to our unspeakable joy aad fatisfactioi-
Being now safely od shore, our pilot soon gotus
a lodgiag, and a ware house for our goods, and
tiieo brought us acquainted with the three missiona-
ry priests, that were there converting the people
to Christianity. After we bad fettled a ibr| or at
correspondence with them, our next concirn was
bow to dispose of the goods, which we did to our
full satisfaction, to au eminent merchant at Japan.
We were one thousand leagues farihw from home
then when we were at Bengal, and basing dispos-
ed of our ship, all the hopes wa had were, that at
the next afair we might perhaps purchase another
vessel that would carry us and our goods whether
we pleased. Upon these hopes we resolved to con-
tinue here, and, to divert ourselves, we took fe*"
vcral little journtes into the country* and spent
two days to fee the city of Nanquin, which wa«
regularly built, and tolerably well sonified: at
our return we found one of the priests going to
Pequin, who solicited us with great earnestness to
bear him company, which we both agreed to do.
We were five and twenty days travelling through
this miserable country infinitely populous, but as
indifferently cultivated; and yet their pride was
infinitely greater inan their poverty. As we pas-
fed by ihe house of one of thuir country gentle-
men, the master ©s which we had the honour, to
ride with two miles; never was Don Quixote so
exactly imitated, never such a compound of poms*
and poveny seen before.
His habit made of callico, was dirty, greafy,
and very proper for a merry-aodrew> or scara-
mouch, with all its tawdry trappings, as banging'
sleeves, tassels, and yet toren and rent in atoiofi
*my part: his Test underneath it was not fcse
dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ex-
quisite sloven, or greasy butcher. His borfc was at
poor starved decreprd thing, that would not fell
for 30 (billings m England: and yet after this
piece of worshipful pomp, attended by ten or twelve
slaves guarding their master to his country scat*
We stopped at a tittle village for refreshment; and
when we came by the country feat of this great
man, we found him silting under a tret at his own
door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great
piece of garlic in the middle, and a bag filled
with greeu pepper by him, and another plant like
ginger, together with a piece of lean mutton in it
all this put together was his worship's repast ; but
pray observe tb« slate of the fool; two women
*!aves brought him his food, which being laid be-
fore htm, two others appeared to perform their
j respect ve offices: one fed him with a spoon,
i while the other scraped off what fell on hii beard
land taffety vest, and gave it to a particular favou-
rite lo eac. And thin we left the wretch pleased
j with the conceit of our admiring kU magnificence
which rather merited ottr scorn and detestation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pequin
accompanied by two servants, aodthe old Portu-
gueze pilot, whose charges we bore and who pro-
ved our interpreter. We had scarce been a week
at Pequin, but he comes laughing to us. Ah, fig-
nior Inglise, said he, me something tell you, make
your heart glad, but make me sorry; for you
bring me here twenty five days journey, and now
sou leave me to go back alone; And which way
shall I make my port after, without de (hip, with-^
out de horse, without pecuue? So he called the
money ia his broken Latia* But in (tort, he told
\is that there was a great caravan of Mqscovite and
polish merchants in the cjiy, who were preparing
to; set out for Moscow by land within ifik wejelts;
$md ibathe was certain we would take this oppor-
tunity, aud consequently chat he might go.bom*

and pleased me; are you certain of this? said I-

wfou was best,to be done, he referred it to me as
I pleased, having pur ,a£Fair§ so well settled at Ben-

ed that if pur pilot would gp with us, we/would
bear his' charges either to Moscow or England and
to give him the sum of 170.I sterling. Her^upori

him sensible os what we could give him here to
lay out to the best advantage; and as for his char-*
ges, we would set him safe on (Lore* God willing-
either in Moscow or England, as he pleased at oar
own charge, except the carriage of his goods.
At this proposal he Was like a man transported,
telling ui he would go with us all the world over,
and so we made preparations for our journey.-But
I think it was near four months beiore all the mer-
chants were ready.
lo the. meantime my partucr and the pilot went
express to the port whete we first put in, to dis-
pose ot what goo^s had been leit there, while I
accompanied a Chiaesc merchant, who was going
to Nanquin, and there boughtfcp pieces of damask,
with about 3oo more of oiher fine silks, and by the
time my partner returned to Pequin, I had tnenn
all carried thither : so that our. ca?go, amounted iit
goods only, to about 4>iOoi. steil. wliich toge-
ther with tea, fine callicoes, nutmegs, and cloves,
loaded 18 camels for our share, besides what we
rode upon, with twp or three spare horses, and
two more ioadenwitn provisions* And indeed the
eompaby in general was very great, making about
400 horse, and about 120 men, well armed aud
provided, We were several nations, among whont
were 5 Scots merchant? inhabiting io, Moscow, and
well experienced in buGness.
We set out for Pckin in the 'beginning 6f Fe-
bruary, old stile; and in two days more, we pas*
fed thro* the gate of the great China wall, which
was ereel eci as a fortification against the Tartars*
being 100 English miles long. We then entered
a country not ocar so populous, cheifly under the
power of the plundering Tartars, several co&»$*»
uisfi of whom we pereciveed riding upon poorfUr-
ved Worses, contemptible as tbemlelves, without
qvier or discipline. Gne time our leader for the
Jlty gave u$ leave to go a hunting- But what do ,
you think we huuted I Duly a^arcel of sheep,
which indeed exceed any iu the world for wild-
uefs and swiftness ; but while we were | u.suiog
our game, we chanced ?o meet with about 40
Tartars, who no sooner perceived us but one of
them blew a horo, at the found of which there
soon appeared a troop of foity or fifty more, at a-
•bottt a mile distance, Hereupon one of the Scots
merchants (who knew their accursed ways) order*
*d us to advance towards them, and attack then*
immedutely. As we advanced, thy let.sty avol-
ky.of arrows, which happily lay a little: short of
u ; this madcus hault a little to return the com-
pliment with bullets. And" then it was, that being
led up by the bold Scot, we sued our pistols intheir
faces, and then drew out our swords 5 but there was
bo occasion, for they flew like timorous sheep, and
only three of them remained, beckoid g the rest
to come up to them. But out brave commander
galloped up to them by 'himself, (hot one dead,
knocked another off his hoi fe* while the third ran
away thus ended th- battle with *be Tartars.
Aker this b*tde, we continued travelling a
month or more, thro* the Emperor oi Chioa's do-
minion*, without "any thing remarkable occurring
except now then meeting with s mall parties or
tribes'" of these Tartars, some of whqm we repelled,
.otlieri would not engage, consider! »g our caravan,
as too formidable for them. At last we came to th*.
city of Naura, which Is a frontier of the Chinese*
j^jrerf jttifi«d, sts foaie will tell youj that mlUW:
oqs of Tartars cannot batter down thek walls • by
which one certainly might think one of our cannons
would do more execution tbao all their legions.
We rested but oneway, and then proceeded fi
our travels, palsing several great rivers and deveits,
'till on the 13th of Apiil> weeamt to ti e kontieis
of Muscovy, the first town of which w,;s calkd
Arguna. . <,
T hishappyoccasion,ar I thouglt,of cqminginto
s christian eduury, made me congratulate the
Sjipots merchant upon u 1. he imiled ai 11 at, telling
me not to rejoice too soon; for said be, except the
Ruffian ioldiers in garrison, aud a few inhalants
of the cities on the road, ail rhe relt of this coun-
try for above 1000 miKs, is inhabited by tbe most T
ignorant and barbarous pagans.
We advanced from the to^n Arguna, by mode-
rate journics and found coovente-Vt garrisons in the
land, filled with chrisUan soldid s for the security
of commerce, and for the convenient lodging of
travellers; but the inhabitants of the country wt-i e
mere pagan*, worshiping ihe fun, moon, and liars.
And this idolatry we met between Arguna, and a
city ol the Tartar* ai d Rulfiai.s joined together,
c-dled Ncrtsiokey ; for being turious to lee theii:
way of living, while the caravans continued to teli
themselves in that city. I went to one of their vii
lages, whese there was to be one of their solemn
saci*£ices. Theie behold upon the stump ol an old"
tree was pheed an idol oi wood, more u«Iy t! an
the representation of the devil himself: its head
was such as resembled no living ciesrme, fcs ears
were as big and high as goats horos^ n cropkcd
.nose, four cornered mouth* and horrible te«t>; it
w^s cb^thed ict slice;  .ikins, had a^gr&iU T*\?t^^^^
ttet, with twb horns growiog thro' it/ and wasefght
feet high, without feet, legs, or proportion. Be-
fore this idol, there, lay *6 or 17 people, who
ftgughf, their offerings and were making thrir
prayers j while at a distance stood three men and
<one bullock, as victims to their ugly monster.
Such stupendous faciilegc as this in robbing the
true God of his honour, silled me with the great-
est astonishment and reflection ; which soon turning
fto rage aod fury, I rode up 10 the image, and cm
in pieces the bonnet that wasupoo his head wtih my
sword, so that it hung down by one os the horns;
"While one of my men that was with me pulled atit
by us &ecp~fkin garment. But immdiately an
Ilidcous howling and out cry ran through the vil-
lage, aod two or thrte bundled people ceming a-
bont our ears, we were obliged to fly For it.
But I had not done with the mooiier ; for the
caravan being to red three nig' ts in the town, 1
told the Scots merchant what I had seen, and
that I was fully resolved to take f( ur or £ve
men well armed with me, in order 10 destroy
the idol, and show the people how little reason they
Md to trust in it, who could not save itself. At
first he laughed at me, representing the danger < f
it, and when it was destroyed what time hjd we
to preach 10 them better things, whoie ztai aod
ignorance was in the highest degree, aod both un-
paralleled; that if I should be taken by them, I
should be served as a poor Ruffian who contemned
their worship; thai is, be stripped naked, and ti-
€d to the top of the idol, theie &n #t with ar-
rows till my boby was full of them, and then
burnt as a sacrifice to the mobster: But. sir, s*ys
be, stace your zeal carries you so far, ratiur than
you stiould be alone, I will accorapanyiyou, and
bsiiig a stout fellow equal to yourself, who- wilJ
affist m in this de%n : and accordingly he brought
one called captain Richardson, who bearing the
story, readily consented; but my partner declined
It, being altogether oui of his way: aod so we three
and my man-servant, resolved to execute this ex-
ploit atmut midnight ;,bui upoo kcond thought
we deferred it to the oexl night, by reason the car-
avan being to go from hence next morning, we
should be out of the govebor's power. Well, I
procured a Tartar's fhcep-skin robe, a bonnet, with
bow and arrows, and every one of us got thel ke
habits. The first right we spent in mixing com-
bustible; raauer with aqua viate, gun-powder, &c.
having a good quanrhy of tar in a pot* And the
last night coming to the idol about eleven o'clock,
the moon behvg up, we found none guarding it;
but we perceived a light in the house, where we
bad seen the priests before One roan was for fi-
ling the hut, another for killing the .people, and a
third for making th>m prisoners, while the t*o1
was destroyed. And in fboit, to the latter we
agreed ; so that knot king at the door we seized the
first that opened it, when stopping bis mouth and
tying, his feet together, les; him with the idol. In
the like manner did we (e»ve iwo others; but the
valiant Scots metchant bring discovered at ltRgih
lushed in upon theru, beingb-eked by us, and set
fire to the composition, which frightened them so
much, that we brought t e n all away as prisoners
to their wooeeti God. Thert we fell to work
with him. daubing him all over wj;h tar mixed
with tshow and brimstone, stoppiighis eyes,ear?
and mouth full of g-uapowder> with a ^r^t picce
d 4 .
of wil jfire in his bonnet, and environed h with
dry fotage. All this being done we unloosed and
«ngag£cd the prfmiers, and set the idol on fire,
which the gun-powder*blowing up, the shape of n
-was deformed, reot and split, which the forage
utterly coofuimd; tor we (layed lolce isd firuc-
liont lest the iguorant idolatrous people stiould
bave throwo themselves into flames. And thus
we came away undiscovered, to the morning, ap-
pearing as busy among our fellow travellers, as no
body eould have expected any other, but that
we had been in our beds all night.
But after we were set out, and had gotten some
small distance from the ctiy, there came a great
multitude os country people to the gates, demand-
ing satisfaction of the Russian governor sot insult-
ing their Priests, aud burning their grrac Cham
Cfai Thaungu, who dwelt in the fun, and that no
mortal would violate his image, but some christian
miscreant. aud therefore" being already do Jts$
than thirty thousand strong, denounced v ar against
them and the ehrifl'ans.
The governor assured ihera he was ignorant of
the raaUer and that none of the garrison had been
abroad, tl*ai indeed there was a caravan that wcr>t
away that morning, that he would feod after them
to encpiire into it; aud whoever were the offenders
foould be delivered into their bands. This satisfi-
ed thetp for the present, but the governor sent to
inform us that if any of us had done it, we should
make our escape: or if not, make all be baste a*
way possibit, while he kept them in play as long as
be could. Hereupon we matched two days and
nights, stopping but very little, till at lift we telkd
ma village called P&lifaufpmd bastsd to Jcwrcm*
aaotfier of the Czar's colonies. But about the se-
cond day's march from the former, having entered
the desert, a d passed ihe lake called Snarksosrr,
we beheld a numerous body cf horse on the other
fkk*of the lake. Atid in three days after, h-VfBg
either fouod their mistake, or informed what way we
took, they came upon us towards the dusk of the
evening just as we bad pitched our camp between
two little but very thick woods, with a little river
running bef-re our front, and we cut down some
trees to place in our re*r ; but b.so e we had fioisti-
ed our fiiuatioo v e enemy was at hand. But no>
filling on m imcneuiately, they sent three messen-
gers, wh > demanded the men who had insulted their
priest , aud burnt then God Cham Chi Thaungu,
with fire, that they might be burnt with fire, and
then they would peaceably depan ; but if not, they
would destroy them all. Hereupon our men stared
one at another, but no bwiy knew is, but he who
did it. Upon which the leader us the caravan an-
swered ibattbey were peaceafble raerchaots, who
mtddk^ with none of their \ t tests & go-:s ; 8c there-
fore defired them not to uistitrb'u*, and put us to
the necessjiy of defending .cuiseWee. But so fa* was
thfi from r±ussytug them, t at the next morning
coming to our Gght, they lei sty a voily of arrows
among us, but did not hutt auy, btcause we shel-
tered ourselves under the baggare; but as we ex-
pected to come to au engagement, a cunning fel-
low* Cossack, obtaining leave of the leader to go
to these people, mounts hi s horse aud rides dtteclJy
from our rear when taking a circuit, he comes back
as tho' he had been sent express, iclb them a formi-
dable story, that the wretches who had burnt the
ClftmCki X&aupgu, lip* goat !• Sibelka, with a
resolution to burn the GodShalisar belonging to the
Tongucses. Upun which beleivro^ tfns cunning
Tartar who was as servant to our Muscovites, a-
way then, they drove to Stheika, and in Itss than
three hoars they were out of sight, nor did we evtr
iee one of them mo?e.
W .en we came 10 the city of Jarawena, we refi
ed there j day?, and duo entered into a frighiful
oVfe. t, which held us twenty, three daysma/Ch, in-
tested wish several small companies of robbers> cf
Mogul Tartars* who never had the courage to at-
tack us. Rut after we had passed over this place,
we found several gatrisons to defend she cara-
vans from the violence ol the Tartats. Id pauicu-
Jarthe governor of Adin? koy offered us 'a guaid of
50 men to ihe next station, if we apprehci.ed as y
danger, all this way the people or natives regain-
ed the fame paganism and barbarity, only not so
dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites.
Theii cloa:hing both of men and, women a e us
the'kins of beasts, living under the ground in
vau'ts-a^d caves, which go out of one into'another.
They have id Is almost in every family; beGde%
tb^ y ad re the fun a d sta s and water and snow;
and the least uncommon ihmg that happens in the
elements, alarms them as much as thunder and
lightning do the unbelieving Jews.
Through all the country nothing more temark-
ble occurred; wlen we bad*gor, through thi* great
^es|si I bef(.re mentioned, after two days fart! er
1 ravel we come to Jvtn^zay, a Muscovite city 00
the great river so called, which, we are told parts
Eur&ne from AGa. Neither here are the pagans
much bettrr, tho intermixed with the Muscovites »
but the wonder will cea(^v*hen I inform my reader
C."»4* )
of what was related to me, that the Czar rather
converts the Tartars with soldiers than Clergymen,
and is more proud to make them faithful iubjects
than good christuns.
Froco.ti is 10 the river Oby9 we traveled of er
4- pleasant, fruitful, but very udi uhivstcd country,
:t> want of good management, aud people, and
i;oie few arc mostly P.-,gans. This i the place
where the Muscovite criminals-are banished to, if
ihty are not pu: to death. The next city w? can/e
to, was the capital city of Siberiw, cased 1 oooliki
when havi g been al molt 7 months on iur journey,
and w riter drawing od ap<<cc, my partner aDd I
consulted cur particular affairs, in what manner
we stiruId dispose as oursclws. We had been told
of (led es and reiu deer to carry us ever the snow
in the winter season, the snow being frozen very
hard, and is like an universal covering to nature,
so that the fledges can run upon the surface with-
out any rcg.ird to what is bent at h- But I being
bound 10 England, I mull either go well fur Narva,
and the gulph of Finland, and so by land or sea to
Denmark; or else I mull leave the caravan at a
little town on the Dwin*, and so to Archangel,
where I was certain ef shipping either to England,
Boiftitd, or Hamburg. One night I happened <o
get into the company oi an illustcrous bin bani&td
prince, whose company and virtues wete Inch, as
made me propose to him a method how he might
obtain his liberty. My dear friend, said he, as £
am free from my miserable greatness with all its
attendanisof pride, ambition, avarice and luxury;
so if I stiouid escape from this place, these perni-
cious feeds may revive again to my lasting disquie-
tude £ therefore let me |jmain in my blessed con-
siaement, fcr T ara but flesh, a mt re ra*D, with
passions and afi'ifctions as such: O be not ruyliiend
and ttrapie? too! Struck dumb wiih surprise, I
Hood silent awMk ;oor was Ik in less.disorder, by
which peiceivimr he wanted so Rive vent to iis
niiad, I defbed him to consider of it, and so with-
drew. But about two hours after, he came to my a-
jpartment, Dear friend, said he, though 1 cannot con-
sent to accompany you, I shall have this satisfaction
in parting, that you leave, an honest man still; but as
a testimony of my affection to you be pleased to accept
of this present of Sables.
I sent my servant the next morning to his highness
y ith a small present of tea, 2 pieces of China damasks
and 4 little wedges of gold, but he only accepted the
tea, one piece of damask, and a piece of gold for the
curiosity of the Japan stamp that was upon it. Not
long after he sent for me, and told me, that what he
had refused himself he hoped upon his account I'would
grant to another whom he should name; in,short it
was his>only son, who was above 200 miles distance
from him on the other side of the Oby, whom he could
send for if I gave my consent. This I soon complied
writh, upon which he sent his servants the nest day for
his son, who returned in twenty days time, bring-
ing seven horses loaded with valuable fur. At night
the young Lord was conducted incognito into* our a-
partment, where his father presentedhim to me. We
then concerted the best ways for travelling, aud after
having bought a considerably*, quantity of sables, black
fbj^skms, fine ermines, &.c. (which I sold at Archangel
at a good pxmice) we set out of this city the Beginning of
June, making- a small caravan, being about 32 horses
arid camels, of which 1 represented the head. My young"
Lord had vvLth him a very faithful Siberian* servant,
well acquainted with the roads; we shunned the prin-
cipal towns and cities, as Tumen, Solimaseoij andse-
oral others by reasorfof their strictness in examining
travellers, leat any of the banished p'ersons of a d^s*
tmetioh should escape. Having passed the river Kama,
we came to a city on th|^|uropean side called Soloy
Kamoskoy where we found the people mostly Pagans
as before. We then passed a desert of about 200 miles
over, but in other places it is near 700: in passing this
wild place, we were »beset with a troop of men on
horseback, about 45, armed with bows and arrows. At
first they looked earnestly on us, and placed themselves
in our way. We were about 16 men and drew up a.
little before our camels. My young Lord sent out his
servant to know who they were, but when he approach-
ed them, he neither knew a word they said nor would
they admit him to come near them at his peril, but
prepared to shoot at him. At his return he told us he-"
believed them to be Calmuck Tartars, and that he;
thought there were more of them upon the desert.*
This was a small comfort to us, yet seing a little grove
about a quarter of a mile distance we moved to it by
the old .Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting* op-
position, We went to work, immediately cutting"
k down great arms of trees, and laid them hanging* (not
quite dff) from one tree to another. And thus we
waited the motions of the enemy, without perceiving
any advancement they made towards us : but about two
hours before night being jomed by some others, they
made about four score horse, among whom we fanci-
ed there were some women, and then coming on us
with great fury, we fired one musket without ball, cal-
ling to them in the Russian tongue to know their bu-
siness; but they, either not knowing, or seeming not
to understand us came directly to the wood side, nos
^.considering that we were so fortified,as that they could
snot break in. Our old pilot the Portuguese proved
|both our captain aiid engineer, and desired us not to.
fere 'till they came within pistol shot; and when he
ave the word of command, then to take the surest
pirn; but he did not bid us give fire, 'till they were
within two piks of us; and then we killed 14 of them,
.wounded several, as also their horses, having every
fee of us loaded our pieces with 2 or three bullets at
feast. Meeting so unexpected a repulse, they retreated.
Kbout an hour after they made another attempt to see
^here they might break in; but finding us ready to
receive them, they retired.
All that night we worked life in strengthening our
situation, axidbarocading the esntm&ce, Into" thrwawfe?
but when day-light came, we had a very unwelcome
discovery; for the enemy being encouraged by more
assistance, had set up 11 or 15 tents in form of a camp,
about 3 quarters of a mile from us. But to escape
their numbers, we had recourse to a stratagem, by
kindling1 a fire to burn ail ni^ht; and no soo&er it
was dark, but we pursued our journey by the pole or
north star; and so traveling* all night, by 6 o'clock in
the morning we came to a Russian village called Ker-
mazinakoy, having travelled about thirty miles; here
we passed a little river called Kertza: and from thenc©
came to a large town named Ozomoys, where we
heard that several troops of Ca^muck Tartars had been
abroad upon the desert, but that we wete past all dan-
ger. Within 5 days after we came to Vemshima, up-
on the liver Wirzedgas from thence we came to Law-
rensxoy on the 3d of July, where providing ourselves
with 2 luggage boats and a conveniant bark, we em-
barked the 6th, and arrived at Archangel the 18th,
We set out from Arch-angel the 20th of August in the
same year, and arrived at the Elb the 30th of Septem-
ber. And here indeed my partner and I made a very
good sale for our goods, both those of China and Siberi,
when dividing -our effects, my share came to 35751,17$-
3d. after idl the losses we had sustained, and charges
we had been at. Here it was at Hamburg; that my
yo-,<ng I.ordjtook his leave of me, in order to go to the
coui-A. of Vienna, not only to see. protection,, but to
correspond with his father's friends: and after we Imd
stayed 4 months in Hamburg, I passed front thence over,
land to the Hague, where embarking in the packet
arrived in London the 10th of January, 1^05, after 1-
years and 9 months absence from England, where
hope to have the blessing of ending my days in peace*
