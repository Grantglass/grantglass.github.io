PREFACE
TTOW to save the time of both teacher and pupil, and at the
-*—"- same time enhance the mental discipline and practical
knowledge of the latter, is an object, the attainment of which
must not only be a source of economy, but a real educational
improvement.
At the present time there is an obvious demand that the books
composing an arithmetical series should not only be fewer in
number but more comprehensive; and, moreover, that one of the
books of such a series should be adapted to that numerous class
of pupils whose time and opportunities are too limited to per-
mit their acquiring more than the elementary principles of
arithmetic and the applications of these to the most familiar
business transactions.
In the preparation of this treatise, the author has endeavored
to supply such a book, by confining the treatment to a limited
number of topics of the most useful and practical character, and
by so thoroughly developing each, both in theory and appli-
cations, as to obviate entirely the necessity of studying these
portions of the subject again in any larger book.
Scarcely too much importance can be given to the study of
mental arithmetic in our elementary schools. There is no doubt,
that when properly taught, it is one of the most effective means
of intellectual training; and yet, although the mental exercises
should always precede the written, this part of the subject is
too generally neglected for want of time.
In this work, oral and written exercises have been thoroughly
combined—the oral preceding and made preparatory to the
written. Sufficient oral arithmetic has been introduced to
answer the purpose of a separate book, thus ensuring attention
to the subject and the saving of much valuable time.
Superiority is claimed for this treatise, in the arrange-
ment and treatment of the subjects; in clear and concise
definitions; in brief and comprehensive rules; in new and
improved methods of operations and analyses; in the great
number and variety of well-graded, practical examples, both
oral and written; in the combination of new processes and
methods with preceding ones as the work advances, which serves
to test and drill the pupil, without the mechanical monotony
which too often attends a single class of exercises; in the
engraved cuts, designed especially to aid in developing and
illustrating the subject taught; and last, but not least, in the
typography and mechanical finish of the whole work.
This book is not designed as an introduction to the "COM-
PLETE ARITHMETIC," as the same subjects are arranged and
treated in a similar manner in both books, the examples, however,
being different, and the Complete Arithmetic containing a few
additional, but not indispensable methods. The pupil who fully
masters this book, and desires to continue the subject, is pre-
pared to take up the " SECOND PART" of the Complete Arith-
metic, which is bound up separately, commencing with the
subjects of Measurements and Percentage.
Thus the author claims that he has practically treated the
whole subject in two comprehensive and well-graded books; for
the pupil that has been well taught in the "First Book" is
prepared to take either the "Intermediate Arithmetic" or the
"Complete Arithmetic ;" the former for a partial course, or the
latter for a ful l course. Or he may take the former and the
Second Part of the latter for a full course.
It is confidently believed that this work will not only meet
the wants of intermediate classes in graded schools, but prove
to be just the text-book needed in a large number of schools in
rural districts, and in evening schools in cities, where the at-
tendance is too limited to allow the use of a fuller and more
extended treatise.
BROOKLYN, September, 1874. D. W. F.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
text-book can wholly take the place of the living teacher,
nor can written be a full substitute for oral instruction.
Good books are only aids, and are made more especially for the
pupil, and must lack much which would be invaluable to the
teacher if it could be presented. Hence, it would be imprac-
ticable to attempt to crowd into a text-book all that should
be in the hands of both teacher and pupil. Very much must
be left for the teacher to supply. The following suggestions
may prove of value:
Seek to cultivate in the pupil the habit of self-reliance, and of
thinking far himself. Avoid doing the pupil's work, only assist-
ing and suggesting enough to stimulate him, and enable him to
overcome difficulties for himself.
Give many examples, both oral and written, besides those in
the book, and require the pupil to construct problems and give
their solution and explanation independently of rules. Be par-
ticular to have him state what is given and what is required,
and to give clearly every step in the operation, since it is far
more important to teach him methods of thought, and how to
reason, rather than what to do.
A limited number of oral questions, but of considerable variety,
have been given as models; but the teacher should add to their
number, until the class fully understand and can promptly solve
and analyze each kind of question, since every oral exercise is
preparatory to a written one.
The models of analysis given for the solution of examples may
be varied according to the nature of the question, and at the dis-
cretion of the teacher.
Dictation exercises should be freely used as far as they can be
adapted to the subject.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
9. To illustrate the method of uniformity in represent-
ing numbers, objects are regarded as arranged in groups
of tens; hence we have single things, or units; next,
groups containing ten units, or ten; next, groups con-
taining ten tens, or one hundred; and again, groups
containing ten hundreds, or one thousand, etc.
10. This method of grouping is called the Decimal
System, from the Latin word decem, which signifies ten.
11. The number of objects may be represented by
words or by characters.
12. The characters may be either figures, or letters.
- 13. Notation is a method of làriting, or of repre-
senting numbers by characters.
14. Numeration is a method of reading numbers
represented by figures.
15. Figures are characters used to express numbers.
16. The method of expressing numbers by figures is
called Arabic, because invented by the Arabs.
ARABIC NOTATION.
17. This method employs ten different characters or
figures to express numbers, viz.:
SrOTATIOX AND N U M E R ATI 0 . 5
Names, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Naught.
18. The first nine are called significant figures, because
each has a value of its own; the last is called Naught,
Zero, or Cipher, and has no value of its own.
19. The first nine numbers are each represented by a
single figure, and are called units of the first order.
20. But since there is no single character to represent
the number ten, by grouping ten ones together there is
formed a unit of the second order, called ten, which is
represented by writing the figure 1 in the second place
with a cipher after it; thus, 10.
21. In the same manner are represented,
Two tens, or Twenty, by 20
Three tens, or Thirty, " 30
Four tens, or Forty, "40
Five tens, or Fifty, "50
Six tens, or Sixty, by 60
Seven tens, or Seventy," 70
Eight tens, or Eighty, " 80
Nine tens, or Ninety, " 90
The suffix ty means ten, as three tens, or thirty, etc.
22. The numbers between ten and twenty are repre-
sented by writing 1 in the second place and the units in
the first place. Thus,
Eleven 11
Twelve 12
Thirteen 13
Fourteen 14
Fifteen 15
Sixteen 16
Seventeen 17
Eighteen 18
Nineteen 19
The words thir-teen, four-teen, etc., mean three and
ten, four and ten, etc.
23. In like manner the numbers between 20 and 30,
are represented by writing the tens in the second place,
and the units in the first place. Thus,
Twenty-one 21
Twenty-two 22
Twenty-three 23
Twenty-four 24
Twenty-five 25
Twenty-six 26

11. Twelve, twenty-five, fifty-seven, thirty-four, sixty-
two, forty-nine, seventeen.
12. Forty-six, sixty-eight, forty-nine, ninety.
24. The greatest number that can be represented by
two figures is 99.
25. By grouping ten units of the second order or ten
tens into a larger collection, there is formed a unit of the
third order, called a hundred, which is represented by
writing the figure 1 in the third place with two ciphers
after it; thus, 100.
26. In like manner are represented
Two hundred by 200
Three hundred "300
Four hundred "400
Five hundred "500
Six hundred by 600
Seven hundred "700
Eight hundred "800
Nine hundred "900
27. The numbers from one hundred to nine hundred
ninety-nine are represented by writing the hundreds in
the third place, the tens in the second place, and the units
in the first place. Hence
28. Orders of Units are denoted by the position
of the figures used in expressing a number.
Thus, 426 represents 6 units of the first order, 2 units of the
second order, or 2 tens, and 4 units of the third order, or 4 hundreds,
and is read four hundred and twenty-six.
29. PRINCIPLES 1. Ten units of any order in a num-
ber make one unit of the next higher order.
2. When any order of units in a number is vacant, fill
the place with a cipher.

and two hundred and thirty-four.
8. The numbers between four hundred and ninety-six,
and five hundred and seven.
9. One hundred and sixty-five, three hundred and
forty, seven hundred and eighty-one, and nine hundred
and seventy-four.
31. The greatest number that can be expressed by
three figures is 999.
32. By grouping ten units of the third order, or ten
hundreds into a larger collection, there is formed a unit
of the fourth order called a thousand, which is repre-
sented by writing the figure 1 in the fourth place with
three ciphers after it; thus, 1000.
33. In like manner are represented:
Two thousand by 2000
Three thousand "3000
Four thousand "4000
Five thousand "5000
Six thousand by 6000
Seven thousand "7000
Eight thousand "8000
Nine thousand "9000
34. The numbers from one thousand to nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine, are represented by writing
thousands in the fourth place, hundreds in the third place,
tens in the second place, and units in the first place.
Thus, 3508 represents 8 units of the first order, 0 units of the
second order, or no tens, 5 units of the third order, or 5 hundreds,
and 3 units of the fourth order, or 3 thousands, and is read three
thousand five hundred and eight.

of the first order.
7. Six units of the fourth order, eight of the second
order, and four of the first order.
8. Nine units of the fourth order, four units of the

16. Seven thousand and seventy-eight.
17. Five thousand two hundred and five.
18. Eight thousand eight hundred and ten.
19. Nine thousand three hundred and fifteen.
36. The greatest number that can be expressed by
four figures is 9999.
37. In the same manner other new orders are formed
to represent larger numbers, by grouping ten units of the
fourth order to form ihefifth order, or tens of thousands;
and ten units of the fifth order to form the sixth order, or
hundreds of thousands; and ten units of the sixth order
to form the seventh order, or millions, etc.
Thus, 263045 represents 5 units of the first order, 4 units of the
second order, or 4 tens, 0 units of the third order, or no hundreds,
3 units of the fourth order, or 3 thousands, 6 units of the ffth order,
or 6 tens of thousands, and 2 units of the sixth order, or 2 hundreds
of thousands, and is read two hundred sixty-three thousand and
forty-five.
38. The value of any order of units is increased tenfold
for every place it is moved from the right to the left.
39. The value of any order of units is diminished ten-
fold for every place it is moved from the left to the right.
40. A Scale in numbers, is a succession of units,
increasing and decreasing according to a certain law, or
rule. Scales are uniform or varying.
41. A Decimal Scale is one in which the law of
increase and decrease is uniformly TEN. Hence, Arabio

DEFINITIONS.
49. Addition is the process of uniting two or more
like numbers into one equivalent number.
50. The Sum, or Amount, is the number ob-
tained by adding.
51. The Sign of Addition is +. It is read plus,
and signifies more; thus, 5 + 6 is read, 5 plus 6, and
means that 5 and 6 are to be added.
52. The Sign of Equality is =. It is read
ADDITION.
equals 11, and means that the sum of 5 and 6 is equal to 11.
It may be read 5 + 6 are 11.
ADDITION.
Read the following:
1. 8 + 4 + 2 = 14.
2. 7 + 6 + 5 = 18.
3. 12 + 6 = 8 + 10.
4. 16 + 8 = 15 + 9.
53. TJie Sign of Dollars is $. It is read dollars.
Thus, $25 is read 25 dollars; $7 is read 7 dollars.
Read the following expressions:
3. $15 + $10 = $16 + $9.
4. $16 + $8 = $10 + $14.
1. $10 + $8 =
2. $12 + $11 = $23.
54. An Equation in Arithmetic, is an expression
of equality between two numbers or sets of numbers.
All that is written be-
fore the sign of equality
is called the first mem-
ber of the equation, and
all that is written after
it is called the second
member of the equation.
The numbers in each
member are called terms
EQUATION. of the e(luation-
Thus, 6 + 4 = 10 is an
equation, and is read 6 plus 4 equals 10, and means that the sum of
6 and 4 is equal to 10. 6 + 4 is the first member of the equation,
and 10 is the second member; and 6, 4, and 10 are the terms of
the equation.
Name the members and the terms of each of the follow-
ing equations:

1.
10 =
2. 8 + 12 = 20
3. 15 + 6 = 21
4. 30 = 20 + 10

DEFINITIONS.
62. Subtraction is the process of finding the dif-
ference between two numbers of the same unit value.
63. The Difference, or Remainder, is the
result obtained by subtracting.
64. Tile Minuend is the number from which
another is to be subtracted.
65. The Subtrahend is the number to be sub-
tracted.
66. TJ)e Sign of Subtraction is —. It is read
minus, and signifies less: thus, 9 — 6, is read 9 minus 6,
and means that 6 is to be subtracted from 9.
29
67. A Parenthesis ( ) is used, to include within
it such numbers as are to be considered together and
subjected to the same operation. A Vinculum, or
Har , has the same signification. Thus, 15 +
(12 — 7), or 15 + 12 — 7, signifies that to 15 is to be
added the difference between 12 and 7

WRITTEN EXERCISES.
72. When any figure of the subtrahend is greater
than the figure of the corresponding order of the
minuend.
]. From 764 subtract 496.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. —Write the numbers as before.
6 15 14 Begin at the right and subtract each order
Minuend 764 of units separately.
Subtrahend 496 Since 6 units cannot be subtracted from
Remainder 268 4 units, increase the 4 units by a unit from
the next higher order, 1 ten or 10 units,
which make 14 units. 6 units from 14 units leave 8 units, which
write under the units.
Since 1 of the tens was united with the units, there are only 5 tens
left. As 9 tens cannot be subtracted from 5 tens, increase the
5 tens by a unit from the next higher order, 1 hundred or 10 tens,
which make 15 tens. 9 tens from 15 tens leave 6 tens, which write
under the tens.
Since 1 of the hundreds was united with the tens, there are only
6 hundreds left. 4 hundreds from 6 hundreds leave 2 hundreds,
which write under the hundreds. Hence the remainder is 268.
In like manner subtract and analyze:
2. 2452 from 6731.
3. 1863 from 3248.
4. 3462 from 7320.
5. 3842 from 4030.
6. 1040 from 5320.
7. 2765 from 4723.
RULE.—I. Write the subtrahend under the minuend,
placing units of the same order under each other.
II. Begin at the right and subtract successively the
units of each order of the subtrahend, from the units of
the corresponding order of the minuend, and write the
result beneath.
III. If the units of any order of the subtrahend be
greater than the units of the corresponding order of the
minuend, increase the latter by 10 and subtract; then
diminish by 1 the units of the next higher order in the
minuend and proceed as before.
PROOF.—Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if
the sum is equal to the minuend,'the work is correct.
Instead of diminishing by 1 the units of the next higher order in
the minuend,, we may increase by 1 the units of the next higher
order in the mbtrahend.

DEFINITIONS.
77. Multiplication is the process of taking one of
two numbers as many times as there are units in the
other. Or,
It is a short method of adding equal numbers.
78. Tlie Multiplicand is the number to be mul-
tiplied.
79. The Multiplier is the number by which to
multiply. It shows how many times the multiplicand
is to be taken.
80. The Product is the result obtained by mul-
tiplying.
The multiplicand and multiplier are called the factors of the
product.
81. The Sign of Multiplication is x. It is
read times, or multiplied by; thus, 8 x 6 is read 8 multi-
plied by 6, or 6 times 8, and means that 8 and 6 are to be
Multiplied together
Since changing the order of the factors does not change the
result, 8x6 may be read 6 times 8, or 8 times 6.

83. PRINCIPLES.—1. The multiplier is always re-
garded as an abstract number.
2. The multiplicand and product are like numbers, and
may be either concrete or abstract.
In examples containing concrete numbers, the concrete number
is the true multiplicand, but when it is the smaller, it is often, for
convenience, used abstractly, as the multiplier.
WRITTEN EXERCISES.
84. When the multiplier consists of but one
figure.
1. How many are 4 times 63?
IST OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—By this operation the result is ob-
6 3 tained by Addition.
6 3 First find the sum of four 3's, or 4 times 3
g g units, which are 12 units, equal to 1 ten and
go 2 units. Write the 2 units in units place, and
• reserve the 1 ten to be added to the sum of the
Sum 25 2 tens
Next the sum of four 6's, or 4 times 6 tens, are
24 tens, plus 1 tenTeserved make 25 tens, or 2 hundreds and 5 tens,
which write in hundreds and tens places. Hence the sum is 252.
2D OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—By this operation, which is
Multiplicand 6 3 much shorter, the multiplicand 63 is written
Multiplier 4 but once, and as it is to be taken 4 times,
_ write the multiplier 4 under it, and com-
mence at the right to multiply. 4 times 3
units are 12 units, or 1 ten and 2 units.
Write the 2 units in units place and reserve the 1 ten to add to the
product of the tens.
Next 4 times 6 tens are 24 tens, pins 1 ten reserved are 25 tens,
or 2 hundreds and 5 tens, which write in the hundreds and tens
places. Hence the product is 252, the same as the sum in the first
operation.

6. If 5 men can do a piece of work in 9 days, how
many days will it take 1 man to do it?
ANALYSIS.—It will take 1 man 5 times as many days as it will
5 men; 5 times 9 days are 45 days. Hence it will take 1 man
45 days.
7. If 8 men can build a wall in 10 days, in how many
days can 1 man build it?
8. If two barrels of flour last 8 persons 3 months,
how long will they last one person?

days, how many horses would consume the same in 1 day?
10. If a man travel 23 miles in 1 day, how far can he
travel in 4 days?
ANALYSIS.—In 4 days he can travel 4 times 23 miles. 23 is equal
to 2 tens and 3 units; 4 times 2 tens are 8 tens, and 4 times 3 units
are 12 units, or 1 ten and 2 units, added to 8 tens, make 9 tens and
2 units, or 92. Hence he can travel 92 miles in 4 days.

4 tens, 45 times any
number must be
equal to 5 times the
5 times 736 are 3680,
number, plus 4 tens, or 40 times the number,
the first partial product.
4 tens times 6 units are 24 tens, or 2 hundreds and 4 tens.
Write the 4 tens in tens place in the second partial product and
reserve the 2 hundreds to add to the product of hundreds.
4 tens times 3 tens are 12 hundreds, plus 2 hundreds reserved are
14 hundreds, or 1 thousand and 4 hundreds. Write the 4 hun-
dreds in hundreds place in the second partial product, and reserve
the 1 thousand to add to the product of thousands.
4 tens times 7 hundreds are 28 thousands, plus 1 thousand
reserved are 29 thousands, or 2 tens of thousands and 9 thousands,
which write in tens of thousands and thousands places.

RULE.—I. Write the multiplier under the multiplicand
with units of the same order under each other.
When the multiplier consists of one figure:
II. Begin at the right and multiply the units of each
order of the multiplicand by the multiplier. Write in the
product the units of each result, and reserve the tens to
add to the next result. •
When the multiplier consists of more than one figure:
III. Multiply the multiplicand by the units of each
order of the multiplier successively, beginning at the right,
and write the right-hand figure of each partial product
under the order of the multiplier used.
The sum of the partial products will be the required
product.
PROOF.—Review the work carefully, or multiply the
multiplier by the multiplicand; if the results are the same,
the work is probably correct.
When there are ciphers between significant figures of the multi-
plier, multiply by the significant figures only, since the product »f
any number by 0 is 0.

87. To multiply by the factors of a number.
The Factors of a number, are the numbers which
multiplied together will produce it. Thus, 4 and 7 are
factors of 28; 2, 3, and 5 are factors of 30.
The pupil should be carefully taught to distinguish between
factors and parts of a number. The factors are multiplied, but the
parts are added, to produce a number.
Thus, 3 and 4, 2 and 6, 2, 2 and 3 are factors of 12; the parts of
12 are 8 and 4, 6 and 6, 7 and 5, etc.
88. PRINCIPLE.—The product of any number of fac-
tors will be the same in whatever order they are multiplied.

It will be observed that the multiplicand, multiplied by the
given multiplier, or by any set of factors into which it can be
separated, produces the same result.
In like manner multiply
2. 3246 by 42 = 6 x 7.
3. 6074 by 56 = 7 x 8.
4. 3708 by 60 = 3 x 4 x 5.
5. 36706 by 72.
6. 50047 by 64.
7. 75034 by 108.
RULE.—I. Separate the multiplier into two or more
factors.
II. Multiply the multiplicand by one of the factors, the
resulting product by another factor, and so continue until
all the factors have been used. The last product will be
the product sought.
8. What will 75 horses cost, at $197 each?
9. What will 60 acres of land cost, at $246 an acre?
10. If the average weight of a bale of cotton be 506
pounds, what will be the total weight of 81 bales?
11. If the receipts of a horse railroad average $807 a
day, what will be the entire receipts for 96 days?
89. When either the multiplicand or multiplier,
or both, have ciphers on the right.
1. Multiply 325 by 100.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Since removing any order of units
325 one place to the left, increases its value ten times
100 (38), therefore annexing a cipher to a number
~' multiplies it by 10. Annexing two ciphers multi-
'"' plies it by 100, etc. Hence 325 x 100 = 32500, the
product required.
2. Multiply 960 by 400.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—960 = 96 x 10 and 400 = 4 x 100.
960 First multiply together the factors 96 and 4, and
400 then multiply their product, 384 by 10 x 100 or
52 MULTIPLICATION.

DEFINITIONS.
94. Division is the process of finding how many
times one number is contained in another; or of finding
one of the equal parts of a number.
95. The Dividend is the number to be divided.
96. The Divisor is the number by which to divide.
97. The Quotient is the result of the division, and
shows how many times the dividend contains the divisor.
The part of the dividend remaining when the division is not
exact is called the Remainder, and must always be less than the
divisor.
The division is said to be exact when there is no remainder.
98. The Sign of Division is -=-. It is read
divided by. When placed between two numbers it shows
that the one before it is to be divided by the one after it;
thus, 36 4- 9 is read 36 divided by 9.
99. Division is also indicated by placing the dividend
above the divisor with a line between them; thus, ^ is
is read 24 divided by 6.

100. Since one number is contained in another as
many times as it can be subtracted from it, division may
be regarded as a short method of performing several sub-
tractions of a number.
Thus, 15 — 5 = 10; 10 — 5 = 5 ; 5 — 5 = 0. We have performed
three subtractions of 5 ; hence there are three 5's in 15, or 5 is con-
tained in 15, 3 times.
101. Since one number is contained in another as
many times as the one is a factor of the other, division
may be regarded as the reverse of multiplication.
In multiplication both factors are given to find the pro-
duct; in division one factor and the product (answering
to the dividend ) are given to find the other factor, which
answers to the quotient.
Thus, 5 x 3 = 15, 5 being a factor of 15 three times; hence there
are three 5's in 15, or 5 is contained in 15, 3 times.
102. The Object of Division is two fold.
First. To find how many times one number is con-
tained in another of the same kind.
Ex. At 3 cents each, how many oranges can be bought for
12 cents 1
Since 3 taken 4 times equals 12 (3 x 4 = 12), it follows that 3 is
contained in 12 four times.
ANALYSIS.—As many oranges can be bought for 12 cents as 3
cents are contained times in 12 cents, which is 4 times; hence
4 oranges can be bought for 12 cents.
103. Second. To separate a given number into as
many equal parts as there are units in another.
Ex. If 4 oranges cost 12 cents, what is the cost of 1 orange?
Since 3 taken 4 times equals 12, it follows that 3 is one of the
four equal parts of 12 (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12), and we say one-fourth
of 12 is 3.
ANALYSIS.—Since 4 oranges cost 12 cents, 1 orange costs one-fourth
of 12 cents, which are 3 cents. Hence 1 orange costs 3 cents.
104. The equal parts into which a unit or whole thing
is divided are sometimes called fractions.
The names of these equal parts of a unit vary accord-
ing to the number of these parts; thus, one-half is one of
two equal parts, one-third is one of three equal parts, one-
fourth is one of four equal parts, into which the whole
thing or number is divided.
So in like manner we have fifths, sixths, sevenths,
eighths, tenths, twelfths, twentieths, etc.
105. These parts are expressed by writing the number
denoting the name of the parts below a short horizontal
line as a divisor, and the number denoting the number of
parts taken or used, above the line as a dividend; thus,
£ signifies I divided by 3, and is read, one-third.
I signifies 3 divided by 4, and is read, three-fourths.
$¡ signifies 9 divided by 20, and is read, nine-twentieths.

number is contained in another;
The divisor and dividend must be like numbers, and the
quotient an abstract number.

n
6 is contained in 9 hundreds 1 hun-
3 7 dred times and a remainder. Write
3 6 the 1 hundred in the quotient. Multi-
64 DIVISION.
.. „ of the quotient produces 6 hundreds,
which write under the hundreds of the
dividend. Subtracting, there is a remainder of 3 hundreds, or 30
tens, to which annex the 7 tens of the dividend, making 37 tens.
6 is contained in 37 tens, 6 tens times and a remainder. Write
the 6 tens in the quotient. Multiplying the divisor by the 6 tens
of the quotient produces 36 tens, which write under the partial
dividend 37 tens. Subtracting there is a remainder of 1 ten, or 10
units, to which unite the 2 units of the dividend, making 12 units.
6 is contained in 12 units, 2 times, which write in the quotient.
Multiplying and subtracting as before, nothing remains. Hence
the quotient is 162.
The solution of the preceding example may be abbre-
viated by what is termed Short Division, as follows •
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—6 is contained in 9, 1 time and
6)972 3 remainder. 3 prefixed to 7 makes 37. 6 is
DIVISION. 65
Quotient 162
prefixed to 2 makes 12. 6 is contained in 12,
2 times. Hence the quotient is 162.

place in the quotient.
Next 8 is not contained in 3 tens any ten times, so write a cipher
in tens place in the quotient, and unite the 3 tens and 5 units,
making 35 units. 8 is contained in 35 units 4 times and 3 units
remainder, which is written over the divisor and added as a part of
the quotient. Hence the quotient is 304J.
PROOF.—Multiplying the quotient 304 by the divisor 8, the pro-
duct is 2432; and 2432 plus the remainder 3 equals the dividend

144
ANALYSIS.—Since 18 is not con-
tained in 3 thousands any thousands
times, unite the 3 thousands with
the 7 hundreds, making 37 hun-
dreds.
18 is contained in 37 hundreds, 2
hundreds times and a remainder.
5 Bern. Write the 2 hundreds in the quo-
tient, and multiply the divisor 18
by this quotient figure 2 hundreds, and write the product 36 hun-
dreds, or 3 thousands 6 hundreds under units of the same order in
the dividend, and subtract, leaving a remainder of 1 hundred. To
this 1 hundred annex the 4 tens of the dividend, making 14 tens.
18 is not contained in 14 tens any tens times, so write a cipher in
the quotient and bring down the 9 units of the dividend, making
149 units.
18 is contained in 149 units, 8 times and a remainder. Write
the 8 units in the quotient and multiply the divisor by this last
quotient figure, and write the product 144 under units of the same
order in the partial dividend and subtract, leaving a remainder of 5.
Write the remainder over the divisor as a part of the quotient.
Hence the quotient is 208 ft.
Proof is the same as in Short Division.

II. Find how many times the divisor is contained in
the least number of left-hand orders of the dividend that
will contain it, and write the result at the right of the
dividend for the first figure of the quotient. .
III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, sub-
tract the product from this partial dividend, and to the
remainder annex the next lower order of the dividend.
IV. Divide as before until all the orders of the dividend
have been used.
V. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor,
write a cipher in the quotient and bring down the next
order of the dividend, and proceed as before.
VI. If there be at last a remainder, write it with the
divisor underneath as part of the quotient.
PROOF.—The same as in short division.
1. If any remainder be equal to or greater than the divisor, the
quotient is too small and must be increased.
2. If the product of the divisor by the quotient figure be greater
than the partial dividend, the quotient is too large and must be
diminished.

DEFINITIONS.
120. An Integer, or Integral Number, is a
number representing whole units; thus, 5, 7, 12 horses,
16 pounds, are integral numbers.
Integers are either even or odd, prime or composite.
121. An Even Number is one that is exactly
divisible by 2.
All numbers terminating with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even.
122. An Odd Number is one that is not exactly
divisible by 2.
ALL numbers terminating with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 are odd.
123. A Prime Number is one that has no in-
tegral factors except unity and itself; thus, 2, 3, 5, 11,
17, etc., are prime numbers.
124. A Composite Number is one that has
other integral factors besides unity and itself; thus, 15
and 24 arc composite numbers, since 15 = 5 x 3, and
24 = 8 x 3, or 6 x 4, etc.
125. The Factors of a number are the numbers
which multiplied together will produce that number (87);
thus, 4 and 5 are factors of 20; 3, 4 and 7 of 84.
126. Factoring is the process of separating a num-
ber into its factors.
127. An Exact Divisor of a number is one that
will divide that number without a remainder; thus, 6 is
an exact divisor of 48; and 9 of 72.
1. The exact divisors of a number are also the factors of that
number.
FACTORS AND DIVISORS. 83
2. An exact divisor of a number is sometimes called the measure
of that number.
3. When a number is a factor, or divisor of each of tico or more
numbers, it is called a common factor, divisor, or measure of those
numbers.
128. Numbers are prime to each other when
they have no common integral factors or divisors; thus,
9 and 16, 12 and 25, are prime to each other.
129. A Prime Factor is one that is a prime
number (123).
The prime factors of a number are also the prime divisors of it.

MULTIPLES. 91
DEFINITIONS.
141. A Multiple is a number exactly divisible by
a given number; or, it is any product of which a given
number is a factor; thus, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, etc., are
multiples of 5.
142. A Common Multiple is a number exactly
divisible by two or more given numbers; thus, 18 is a
common multiple of 2, 3, 6 and 9.
143. The Least Common Multiple is the least
number exactly divisible by two or more given numbers;
thus, 24 is the least common multiple of 3, 4, 6 and 8,
since no number less than 24 will contain each of them.
144. PRINCIPLES.—1. A multiple of a number must
contain all the prime factors of that number,
2. The least common multiple of two or more numbers
is the least number that will contain all the prime factors
of each of those numbers.

1. Find the least common multiple of 12, 18 and 42.

hence it must contain all the

But the least common multiple of 42 must also contain all the
prime factors of each of the other numbers, and since the primo
factors 2 and 3 are common also to 18 and 12, omit them and annex
the remaining factors 3 and 2 to those of 42, and the series 2, 3, 7,

SECOND METHOD.

and 27.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Write the numbers in
12 27 a horizontal line, with a vertical line
7 n at the left.
Since 3 is a prime factor of one or
4= '-' more of the given numbers, it must
also be a factor of the least common
92 PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS.
write the quotients in a line underneath. For a like reason, divide
again by 3, and write the quotient and undivided number 4 in a
line below, as before, omitting to write any quotient when it is 1. .
Since there is no factor common to 4 and 3, they are prime to
each other, and hence the divisors 3 and 3, with the numbers 4
and 3 in the last line are all the prime factors contained in the
given numbers, and their product 108 is the least common multiple
sought. (PEIN. 2.)
If in any example any of the smaller numbers are exactly con-
tained in the larger, the smaller may be omitted in finding the
least common multiple, inasmuch as a number that will contain
a given number will contain any factor of that number.
Thus, if required to find the least common multiple of 6, 12, 36,
84 and 108, omit all the numbers except 84 and 108, since the
others are factors of these, and the least common multiple of 84
and 108 will be the least common multiple of all the numbers.

two or more of the given numbers, and write the quotients

148. PRINCIPLES.—1. Rejecting a factor from any
number divides the number by that factor.
2. Rejecting an equal factor from both dividend and
divisor does not change the quotient.
149. Cancellation is the process of abbreviating
operations in division by rejecting equal factors from
both dividend and divisor.
WJtITTEN EXERCrSES.
1. What is the quotient of 9 times 14 divided by
6 times 7?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Write the
9x14 3 x $ x 2 x # 3 „ numbers as in division,
6x7 # x ? x # 1 tne dividend above and
the divisor below the line.
Resolve the numbers into their factors, the dividend being com-
posed of 3x3x2x7, and the divisor of 2 x 3 x 7. Cancelling
equal factors from both dividend and divisor, which is the same as
dividing by those factors, there is left the factor 3 in the dividend.
Hence the quotient is 3.
2. Divide 12 x 8 x 6 by 8 x 4 x 3.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. — In this example
3 2 first strike out the factor 8, com-
Í 5$ x $ x 0 3x2 mon to the dividend and divisor.
$ x & x 3 1 Next cancel the factor 4 from 4
and 12, leaving the factor 3 in
the dividend. In like manner cancel the factor 3 from 3 and 6,
leaving the factor 2 in the dividend. Hence the quotient is 3 x 2=6.
By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of the
dividend on the right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divi-
sor on the left.

DEFINITIONS.
153. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts
of a unit; thus, 1 half, 2 thirds, 3 fifths, are fractions.
154. A Fractional Unit is one of the equal parts
into which any integer is divided; thus, 1 third, 1
fourth, etc., are fractional units of thirds, fourths, etc.
155. Fractions are divided into two classes, viz.:
Common Fractions and Decimal Fractions, and are dis-
tinguished by their forms.
156. A Common Fraction is expressed in fig-
ures by two integers, one placed over the other with a
line between them, thus:
One-half.-,, is written
One-third"
Two-thirds is written f
Three-fourths" f
101
Five-sixths is written | Nine-fourteenths is written'
Three-eighths" -J Eleven-twentieths " ^
Seven-eighths" -J Twelve twenty-thirds" ^-|
Five-ninths " | Ten thirty-fifths "'
157. The Denominator of a fraction is the num-
ber written below the line.
It shows into how many equal parts the unit is divided, and also
indicates the name of these parts ; thus, in the fraction |, 6 is the
denominator and shows that the unit is divided into six equal
parts, and named sixths.
158. The Numerator of a fraction is the number
written above, the line.
It shows the number of equal parts taken to form the fraction;
thus, in f, 5 is the numerator, and shows that 5 of the 6 equal
parts are taken, or expressed by the fraction.
159. Hie Terms of a fraction are its numerator
and denominator; thus, 6 and 7 are the terms of the
fraction 4.

160. Common Fractions aie classified as Proper
and Improper.
161. A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator
is less than its denominator, and its value is less than 1;
thus, |, |, ^ are proper fractions.
163. An Improper Fraction is one whose nu-
merator equals or exceeds its denominator, and its value
is 1, or more than 1; thus, £, -$, V are improper fractions.
163. A Mixed Number is an integer and a frac-
tion united; thus, 31, 5-f, are equivalent to 3+£, 5+f.
164. Fractions may be considered as indicating divi-
sion, the numerator corresponding to the dividend, and
the denominator to the divisor (99). Hence
165. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of its
numerator divided by its denominator; thus -§- = 3.
Analyze the fraction f.
ANALYSIS.—f is a common fraction ; 6 is the denominator, and
shows that the unit is divided into 6 equal parts; £ is the fractional
unit, since it is 1 of the 6 equal parts into which the unit is di-
vided; 5 is the numerator, and shows that 5 of these equal parts
are taken; 5 and 6 are the terms of the fraction; it is a proper
fraction, since the numerator is less than the denominator; its
value is less than 1 ; and it is read five-sixths.

166. Since a fraction may indicate division, all changes
in the terms of a fraction will affect the value of that
fraction according to the laws of division, as shown in
the following illustrations:
1. Multiply the numerator of the fraction $ by 2, and the result
is J. The value of each of the fractional units remain the same,
-while their number is made 2 times as great. So |. * 3 = J.
2. Divide the numerator of the fraction f by 2, and the result
is $. The value of each of the fractional units remains the same,
while their number is diminished J. So ^ 2 = ji.
3. Multiply the denominator of the fraction | by 2, and the
result is -,%- The value of each of the fractional units is dimin-
ished i, while their number remains the same. So £ x g = |-.
4. Divide the denominator of the fraction £ by 2, and the result
is }. The value of each of the fractional units is made 2 times as
great, while their number remains the same. So Í _._ — e
5. Multiply both terms of the fraction J by 2, and the result
is -,"„. The value of each of the fractional units is diminished
i, but their number is made 2 times as great. So ^ £ | = -fc.
6. Divide both terms of the fraction g by 2, and the result is \.

WRITTEN EXERCISES.
1. Eeduce f- and \ to equivalent fractions having a
common denominator.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—The product of the denomi-
4x6 = 24 nators 4 and 6 is 24, a common denominator.
£ x e = 44 ^ut since the value of the fractions must
j x 4 __ on not be changed, each numerator must be mul-
6X4 "4 tiplied by the same number that its denomi-
nator is multiplied by (167, III, 1).
Hence multiplying the terms of J by 6, the result is £f, and of jj
by 4, the result is f f. Or,
The numerators may be found by taking such part of the com-
mon denominator 24 as the given fraction is of 1 ; thus, J of 24 is
18, and g of 24 is 20 ; hence Î = if, and f=|J.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
199. A Decimal Fraction is one or more of the
decimal divisions of a unit. Thus, ^, -&, T|7r, TffT,
etc., are decimal fractions.
200. Decimal fractions are commonly called Decimals.
201. Decimal Fractions are unlike Common Fractions,
because their denominators increase and decrease by the
uniform scale of 10, the same as integers. The fractional
units are, therefore, always tenths, hundredths, thou-
sandths, etc.
202. The Decimal Sign (.), called the decimal
point, is used to distinguish a decimal from an integer,
and must always be placed at the left, or before the figure
or figures that are to be regarded as decimals.
It also indicates the denominator, and determines the
value of the decimal expression.
203. Decimal fractions may be numerically written
in two ways, viz.: either as common fractions, the de-
nominator being expressed, or in decimal notation, the
denominator being omitted, but indicated from the place
the numerator occupies in the scale. Thus,
^, or .5, read 5 tenths.
".25, " 25 hundredths.
".125, " 125 thousandths.
".07," 7 hundredths.
".016," 16 thousandths.
".009," 9 thousandths.
204. The denominator of a decimal fraction, when
expressed, is always 10,100, 1000, etc., or 1, with as many
ciphers annexed as there are figures in the given decimal.
NOTATION AND NUMERATION. 149
205. To express in decimal form a decimal fraction
written in the form of a common fraction, omit the de-
nominator, and if the numerator contain as many figures
as there are ciphers in the denominator, place the point
before it for the decimal required. Thus, ^ = .7;

The teacher should exercise the class orauy by rapidly dictating
similar examples, thus: "The denominator is 100, the numerator 5:
what will express the decimal?" The prompt response should be,
"Point, naught,five, read five-hundredths" (.05).
Ques. "The denominator is 1000, the numerator 26?"
Ans. "Point, naught, tico, six, read twenty-six thousandths" (.026).
2O8. 1. Express and read as a common fraction .09.

3. .009; .075; .150; .204; .040; .110.
Oral exercises similar to the following should be freely used.
The teacher pronounces distinctly, "Point, naught, five." The
pupil promptly responds, "The numerator is five, the denominator
one hundred, and the fraction is fice hundredths" (TUTJ)-
Qiies. "Point, naught, two, six?" Ans. "The numerator is
twenty-six, the denominator one thousand, and the fraction is twenty-
six thousandths" (TUou)-
2O9. When the decimal point stands between the
integral and decimal parts of the same number it is also
called the sepatrix, and is read, and; thus, 5.6 is read
5 and 6 tenths; 9.36 is read 9 and 36 hundredths.
When an integer and decimal are written together the
expression is a Mixed Number (163).
The relation of decimals and integers to each other is
clearly shown by the following

INTEGERS. DECIMALS. •
21O. As in integers, so in decimals, make the order
of units the starting point of notation and numeration,
extending the scale to the left of units place in writing
integers, and to the right of units place in writing decimals.
The first order to the left of units is tens, and the first order to
the right of units is tenths; the second order at the left is hun-
dreds, and the second order to the right is hundredths; the third
order to the left is thousands, and the third order to the right is
thousandths, and so on, the integers on the left, and the decimate
on the right, corresponding in name, being equally distant from
the units place.
211. Both in integers and in decimals, the value ex-
pressed by any figure is determined by the position of
that figure, and is always ten times the value of the same
figure in the next lower order, or 1 tenth the value of the
same figure in the next higher order. Hence,
212. In writing decimals, as in integers, vacant orders
must be filled with ciphers (29, 2).
To express 4 thousandths, write 4 in the third place,
and ciphers in the second and first places; thus, .004.
213. Placing a cipher after the point and before the
numerator of a decimal fraction, multiplies the denomi-
nator by 10, hence divides the decimal by 10 (167, II, 2).
Thus, .3 = A; .03 = T^ , .003 = ^^ etc. Or, .3
4- 10 = .03; .03 ^- 10 = .003, etc.
214. Kejecting a cipher from before the numerator
divides the denominator by 10, hence multiplies the deci-
mal by 10 (167,1, 2).
152 DECIMALS.
10 = .05; .05 x 10 = .5.
215. Annexing a cipher to a decimal multiplies both
numerator and denominator by 10, hence reduces to
higher terms (167, III, 1).
152 DECIMALS.
.3 — .30 = .300, etc.
216. Kejecting a cipher from the right of a decimal
divides both numerator and denominator by 10, hence
reduces to lower terms (167, III, 2).
152 DECIMALS.
.50 = .5.
From the preceding illustrations are readily deduced
the following
217. PRINCIPLES.—1. Decimals are governed by the
same laws of notation as integers. Hence
2. The value of any decimal figure depends upon the
place it occupies at the right of the decimal sign (211).
3. Every removal of a decimal figure one place to the
right diminishes its value tenfold (213).
4. Every removal of a decimal figure one place to the
left increases its value tenfold (214).
5. Ciphers may be annexed to, or omitted from, the right
of any decimal, without changing its value (215, 216).
WRITTEN EXERCISES.
1. Express in figures fifty-four thousandths.
tyo =.054 ANALYSIS.—The numerator is 54, and the
denominator 1000. Since 54 thousandths
decimally expressed is equal to 5 hundredths and 4 thousandths,
write 4 in thousandths place, and 5 in hundredths place, and a
cipher in tenths place. Hence .054 is the decimal required.

2. Twelve hundredths.
3. Nine thousandths.
4. Forty-six hundredths.
5. Twenty-five thousandths.
6. Ninety-two thousandths.
7. Eight ten-thousandths.

its proper value, and place the decimal point before tenths.

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
220. Currency is money, as coin, bank-bills, treas-
ury notes, etc., in circulation as a medium of trade.
221. A Decimal Currency is a currency whose
denominations increase and decrease by the uniform scale
of 10.
222. The Legal Currency of the United States,
is a decimal currency, and is sometimes called Federal, or
United States money.
223. Its denominations and their relative values are
shown in the following
TABLE.
10 mills (m.) make 1 cent. c. or ct.
10 cents "1 dime. d.
10 dimes or 100 cents" 1 dollar. $.

DECIMAL CURRENCY. 157
224. The dollar is the unit of United States money,
and all the lower denominations are decimals of a dollar,
and separated from it by the decimal point. Thus, two
dollars four dimes six cents five mills, are expressed $2.465.
225. It will thus be seen that the dime is 1 tenth part
of the unit, or dollar; the cent is 1 tenth part of the
dime, or 1 hundredth part of the dollar; and the mill is
1 tenth part of the cent, or 1 Imndredth part of the dime,
or 1 thousandth part of the dollar.
The denomination of dimes is not regarded in business opera-
tions, but the two places of dimes and cents, or of tenths and hun-
dredths are appropriated to cents. Thus, 5 dollars 3 dimes 6 cents
are written $5.36, and readme doUars thirty-six cents. Hence,
226. When the number expressing cents is less than
10, write a cipher before it in the place of tenths, or
dimes. Thus, 7 cents is written $.07; 9 cents, $.09.
In business, cents are frequently written as common fractions of
a dollar; thus, $3.25 is written $3A%, and read 3 and -ff¡¡ dollars.
The half-cent may be written either as a common fraction, J, or as
5 mills. Thus, 37 and one-half cents is written $.37i, or $.375.
In business calculations, if the mills in the final result is 5, or
more than 5, they are considered a cent; if less than 5, they are not
regarded. Thus, $3.198 would be called $3.20, and $1.254, would
be called $1.25.
227. PRINCIPLES.—1. Decimal Currency is expressed
according to the decimal system of notation.
2. All the operations upon Decimal Currency are the
same as the corresponding operations on Decimals.
United States money was established by act of Congress, 1786.
Previous to that, pounds, shillings and pence were in use.

WRITTEN EXERCISES.
1. Reduce .4 and .23 to ten-thousandths.
OPERATION ANALYSIS.—Since annexing ciphers to a
decimal does not change its value (215),
160 DECIMALS.
* annex ciphers to the given decimals until
.23 = .2300 the right-hand cipher occupies the place
of the required order.
2. Reduce . 06 and . 034 to ten-thousandths.
3. Reduce .9 and .240 to hundred-thousandths.
4. Reduce .0041 and .07 to millionths.
5. Reduce . 326 to ten-millionths.
6. Reduce .32016 to hundred-millionths.
7. Reduce . 006 to hundred-thousandths.
8. Reduce .8, .104 and .0031 to equivalent decimals
having a common denominator.
9. Reduce 24, 2.73, .0062 and .9 to equivalent deci-
mals having a common denominator.
An integer is reduced to a decimal by placing the decimal point
after units, and annexing ciphers ; one cipher reducing it to tenths,
two ciphers, to hundredths, and so on. Thus, 2 = 2.0 = 2.00.
10. Change $25 to cents.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Since $1 is 100
$25 X 100 = 2500 cents, cents, $25 are 25 times 100
cents, or 2500 cents (89).
Hence,
229. To change dollars to cents omit the sign ($)
and annex two ciphers; dollars to mills annex three
ciphers; cents to mills annex one cipher. Thus, 19 =
900 cents = 9000 mills; $.45 = 450 mills.

18. How many mills are $27? $. 96? $. 72? $. 87?
23O. To change dollars and cents, or dollars cents
and mills, to mills, remove the decimal point and
sign ($). Thus, $4.28 equals 428 cents; $2.375 equals
2375 mills.
19. How many cents in $18.75? $84.09? $30.06?
20. How many mills in $5.625? $.76? $.085?
21. Reduce. 03400 to thousandths.
OPKRATION. ANALYSIS.—Since omitting ciphers
.034|00 = .034 from the right of a decimal does not
change its value (216), cut ofE as
ma»y ciphers or figures from the right of the given decimal as will
reduce it to the required order.

28. Reduce .75030000 to hundred-thousandths.
29. Reduce 2.00800000 to millionths.
30. Change 1875 cents to dollars.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Since 100 cents make $1,
1100)18175 W15 cents are as many dollars as 100 cents
"T are contained times in 1875, which ia 18.75
* l 8 ' 7 5 times (113). Hence,

24O. PRINCIPLE.—The quotient must contain as many
decimal places as there are decimal places in the dividend,
less the number of decimal places in the divisor.
WRITTEN EXERCISES.
1. Divide 4.265 by 5.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—4.265 is 4265 thousandths; £ of
5)4.265 4265 thousandths is 853 thousandths. Hence
.853 4-265 divided by 5 is .853.
2. What is the quotient of .624 divided by .6?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Divide as in common fractions
174 DECIMALS.
174 DECIMALS.
Divide as in integers, and since the dividend
contains three decimal places and the divisor one, the quotient must
have two decimal places. (PBIN.)

4. .675 by .15.
5. $26.64 by 8.
Divide
6. $41.42 by $5.45.
7. 3.76 by .8.
8. 17.6 by 44.
RULE.—Divide as in division of integers, and from the
right of the quotient point off as many figures for decimals
as the number of decimal places in the dividend exceed
ffiose in the divisor.
1. If the number of figures in the quotient be less than the
excess of the decimal places in the dividend over those in the
divisor, the deficiency must be supplied by prefixing ciphers.
2. If there be a remainder after dividing the dividend, annex
ciphers, and continue the division : the ciphers annexed are deci-
mals of the dividend.
3. The dividend must always contain at least as many decimal
places as the divisor, before commencing the division.
4. In most business transactions, the division is considered suffi-
ciently exact when the quotient is carried to 4 decimal places,
unless great accuracy is required.
5. To divide by 10, 100, 1000, etc., remove the decimal point
in the dividend as many places to the left as there are ciphers in the
divisor (113).

pounds?
7. Define an Account. A Debtor. A Creditor. A Bill. Define
the abbreviations most commonly used in business.
DENOMINATE NUMBERS.
254k. A Denominate Number is a number con-
sisting of concrete units of one denomination; as 4
weeks; 6 feet; 9 pounds.
255. A Simple Number is either an abstract
number, or a denominate number of but one denomina-
tion; as 12; 6 quarts; 3 pounds.
256. A Compound Denominate Number is
a number consisting of two or more denominations of the
same nature or kind; as 8 pounds 6 ounces; 5 gallons
2 quarts 1 pint.
257. In simple numbers and in decimals the law of
increase and decrease is by the uniform scale of 10; but
in compound numbers the scale varies according to the
standard unit.
MEASURES.
258. A Measure is a standard unit established by
law or custom, and by which extent, dimension, capacity
amount, or value is estimated.
259. Thus, the standard unit of measures of Exten-
sion is the yard; of Liquid Measure, the wine gallon; of
Dry Measure, the Winchester bushel; of Weight, the Troy
pound, etc. Hence the length of a piece of cloth is
ascertained by applying a yard measure; the capacity of
a cask, by the use of the gallon measure; of a bin, by the
use of the bushel measure; the weight of a body, by the
pound weight, etc.
MONEY.
189
260. Measures may be classified into six kinds:
Money, or Value, Weight,
Extension, Time,

SURFACE, OR SQUARE MEASURE.
290. Surface, or Square Measure, is used in
computing areas, or surfaces; as of land, boards, paint-
ing, plastering, etc.
291. A Surface has two di-
mensions—length and breadth.
292. A Square is a plane fig- -
ure having four equal sides and four * |
right angles (329).
A Square Inch is a square, each side of
which is 1 inch in length.
A Square Foot is a square, each side of which is 1 foot in
length.
293. A Rectangle is a plane figure having four
right angles, and its opposite sides
equal.
When all its sides are equal it is called
a square.
294. The Area of a plane figure is the surface
included within the lines which bound it, and is ex-
pressed by the number of times it contains a given unit
of measure.
295. The Unit of Measure for surfaces is a
square, each side of which is a unit of some known
length.
Thus, the unit of square inches is 1 inch square; of
square feet, 1 foot square, etc.

DENOMINATE NUMBERS.
296. A Square Yard is a square, each side of
which is 1 yard, or 3 feet in length.
If each square in the diagram repre-
sents 1 square foot, or a surface 1 foot
square, the area is, 3 sq. ft x 3 — 9 sq. ft.
A rectangular surface may have the two
dimensions alike, or both different. A
blackboard 15 ft. long and 4 ft. wide con-
tains 15 x 4 = 60 square feet of surface.
3 sq. ft. x 3 = 9 eq. ft. Hence,
297. The area of a square or rectangle is found by
multiplying the length by the breadth.
298. The area and one side being given, the other side
is found by dividing the area by the given side.

Artificers estimate their work as follows:
By the square foot; as in glazing, stone-cutting, etc.
By the square yard, or by the square of 100 square feet; as in
plastering, flooring, roofing, paving, etc.
Brickwork is usually estimated by the 1000 bricks; sometimes
in cubic feet.
299. The Acre is the unit of land measure used by
surveyors in computing the area of land, and is sub-
divided as follows:

CUBIC, OR SOLID MEASURE.
300. Cubic, or Solid Measure, is used in com-
puting the volume or contents of solids; as of timber,
stone, boxes of goods, capacity of rooms, bins, ships, etc.
301. A Solid has three dimensions—length, breadth
and thickness.
3O2. A Cube is a body
bounded by six equal squares
called faces. The sides of
the squares are called the
edges of the cube.
A Cubic Inch is a cube, each
edge of which is 1 inch in length.
A Cubic Foot is a cube, each
ï inch.
edge of which is 1 foot in length.

201

303. A Rectangular Body is one bounded by
six rectangular faces, the op-
posite ones being equal and
parallel.
When all the faces are equal, it
is called a cube.
304. Ttie Volume, or contents of a body, is the
space included within the surfaces which bound it, and
is expressed by the number of times it contains a given
unit of measure.
305. The Unit of Measure for a Solid, is a
cube, the edge of which is a unit of some known
length.
Thus, the unit of cubic inches, is a cube the edge of
which is 1 inch long; of cubic feet, is a cube, the edge of
which is 1 foot long, etc.
306. A Cubic Yard is a cube, each edge of which
is 1 yard, or 3 feet in length.

8 en. ft. x 3 = 9 en. ft.
9 cu. ft. x 3 = 27 cu. ft.
If each small cube in the diagram represents one cubic foot, the
solidity or contents of each layer is 3 cu. ft. x 3 = 9 cubic feet; and
the solidity of the 3 layers, or large cube, is 3 times 9 cu. ft., or
3 cu. ft. x 3 x 3 = 27 cubic feet.

A block of marble 6 ft. long, 4 ft. wide, and 3 ft. thick contains
6 x 4 x 3=72 cubic, or solid feet. Hence,
307. The contents of a cubic or rectangular solid are
found by multiplying the length by the breadth, and their
product by the thickness.

CIRCULAR MEASURE.
323. Circular, or Angular Measure, is used
in measuring angles and arcs of circles, in determining
latitude and longitude, the location of places, the motion
of the heavenly bodies, etc.
324. The Unit is the degree, which is ^^ part of
the circumference of any
circle.
325. A Circle is a
plane figure bounded by a
curved line, every point of
which is equally distant
from a point within called A
the center.
326. A Circumfer-
ence is the line that
bounds the circle.
327. An Arc is any part of the circumference; as
AD, DE.
328. An Angle is the difference in the direction
of two lines proceeding from a
common point, called the vertex.

33O. A Degree is one of the 360 equal parts into
which the circumference of a circle is supposed to be
divided. Thus, E and B (Fig. 1) are at the distance of
90°, or a right angle from each other, the vertex being at
the center of the circle.
3 331. The Measure of
an Angle is the arc of the
circle included between its
sides. Thus, the arc D B, in
Fig. 3, is the measure of the
angle DOB.

A Semi- Circumference is one-half oî a circumference, or 180°.
A. Qiindruttt is one-fourth of a circumference, or 90°.
A Sextant is one-sixth of a circumference, or 60°.
A Sif/H is one-twelfth of a circumference, or 30'.
A Degree (1°) is one-nintieth of a right angle.
The length of a degree varies with the size of the circle; thus,
a degree of longitude at the Equator is 69.16 statute miles, at 30°
of latitude it is 59.81 miles, at 60° of latitude it is 34.53 miles, and
at 90°, or the poles, it is nothing.
A minute of the earth's circumference is called a geographic, or
nautical mile, and is about 1J common miles.

tion to another without altering their value.
Reduction is of two kinds—Descending and Ascending.
336. Reduction Descending is the process of
changing numbers of a higher denomination to equiva-
lent ones of a lower denomination; as feet to inches.
337. Reduction Ascending is the process of
changing numbers of a lower denomination to equivalent
ones of a higher denomination; as inches to feet.

REDUCTION OF DENOMINATE FRACTIONS.
343. A Denominate Fraction is a fraction
whose integral unit is a denominate number. Thus, -| of
a pound, .5 of a mile, are denominate fractions.
1. Denominate Fractions are written either as Common Fractions,
or as Decimals.
2. The principles, operations and analyses of Denominate Frac-
tions are essentially the same as those of Denominate Integers.
CASE I.
344. To reduce a denominate fraction to inte-
gers of lower denominations.
1. How many inches in f of a foot?
ANALYSIS.—Since 1 foot is 12 in., J of 1 foot is \ of 12 in., or
9 in. Hence J ft. = 9 in.
2. How many ounces in 4 Ib.? In £ Ib.? In f Ib.?
3. How many quarts in f pk.? In f pk.? In f bu.?
4. How many hours in | da.? In f da.? In £ da.?
5. Change to months £ yr. f yr. f yr. -fa yr.
6. Change to pounds £ bu. oats. -J bu. corn, f bu. beans.
7. How many pounds in £ bbl. flour? In f bbl. beef.
In|bbl. pork?
8. How much is .5 of a pound Troy?
ANALYSIS.—Since 1 pound is 12 oz., .5 of 12 oz., or 12 x .5=6 oz.
Hence .5 Ib. — 6 oz.
9. How much is. 6 of a £? .5 of a foot? .25ofacwt.?
10. Change to minutes .3 hr. .25 hr. .7 hr. .8 hr.
11. How much is .25 of a bu.? .5 of a gal.?
12. Change to pounds .36 of a cwt. .2 of a ton.
WRITTEN EXERCISES.

denominations.
1ST OPERATION. 1ST OPERATION.
REDUCTION. 227
I pk. x 8 = | = If qt. .2 pk. x 8 — 1.6 qt.
£ qt. x 2 = | = 1£ P*- -6 qt. x 2 = 1.2 pt.
Hence Hence
REDUCTION. 227
ANALYSIS.—Since there are 4 pk. in 1 bu., there are 4 times as
many pecks as bushels ; and since there are 8 qt. in 1 pk., there
are 8 times as many quarts as pecks; and last, since there are 2 pt.
in 1 qt., there are 2 times as many quarts as pints. Hence £, or
.8 bu. = 3 pk. 1 qt. 1i, or 1.2 pt.
The following methods may be regarded as most con-
venient in practice, since the operations are performed
without rewriting the fractional part of each product.

2. Reduce 1 oz. 6 pwt. 16 gr. to the fraction of a pound.
3. Reduce 3 cd. ft. 8 cu. ft. to the decimal of a cord.
RULE.—I. Divide the lowest denomination given by that

ADDITION.
346. Denominate Numbers are added, subtracted,
multiplied and divided by the same general methods as
are employed for like operations in Simple Numbers.
The corresponding processes are based upon the same
principles; the only modification of the rules is that
required in reducing by a varying instead of a uniform
scale of 10.

SUBTRACTION.
WRITTEN EXERCISES.
347. 1. From 16 Ib.. 8 oz. 6 pwt. 10 gr., take 7 lb.
4 oz. 12 pwt. 6 gr.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.—Write the subtrahend
lb. oz. pwt. gr. under the minuend so that units of
16 8 6 10 the same denomination shall stand
w 4 j 2 6 in the same column, and begin at
—7 ~ 7'T T the right to subtract.
Subtract 6 gr. from 10 gr., and
write the difference, 4 gr., under the grains.
Since 12 pwt. cannot be subtracted from 6 pwt., take 1 oz. equal
to 20 pwt. from the 8 oz., leaving 7 oz., and add it to the 6 pwt.,
making 26 pwt. Subtract 12 pwt. from 26 pwt., and write the dif-
ference, 14 pwt., under the pennyweights.
Since 1 oz. was taken from 8 oz., subtract 4 oz. from 7 oz., and
write the difference, 3 oz., under the ounces.
Subtract 7 lb. from 16 lb., and write the difference, 9 lb., under

RULE.—I. Write the multiplier under the lowest de-
nomination of the multiplicand.
II. Multiply each denomination separately, as in simple
numbers, and if the product is less than a unit of the next
higher denomination, write it under the term multiplied.
III. When the product of any denomination is equal to,
or greater than a unit of the next higher denomination,
reduce it to that denomination and write the excess, if any,
under the term multiplied, and add the quotient to the
product of the next higher denomination.
When the multiplier is a composite number and more than 12,
we may multiply first by one of the factors, and that partial pro-
duct by another, and so on (88).

4. What part of 100 hundredths is 10 hundredths? Is

354. Percentage is a term applied to all computa-
tions in which 100 is used as a fixed measure or standard.
355. Per Cent, is an abbreviation of the Latin
phrase per centum, which signifies by the hundred, and is
used in business transactions to signify hundredths of
any thing or quantity.
Thus 5 per cent means T^ÎT. the 5 standing for the numerator,
and the words • ' per cent" always for the denominator 100.
The phrase "per cent." wherever it occurs, should invariably
suggest to the mind a horizontal line with 100 below it, or a decimal
to the hundredths place. Thus, per cent — 100; 25 per cent — Mr,
or .25.
356. The Sign % is generally used by business
men in place of the words per cent. Thus, 6$ signifies
6 per cent.
5 per cent, 5Í, TWÏÏ an(l -05 are equivalent expressions ; the first
two are used in the statement of questions, the other two in per-
forming the operations.

DEFINITIONS.
365. In the applications of percentage, three elements
or parts at least are considered, viz.: the Rate, the Base,
and the Percentage. Any two of these being given, the
other can be found.
366. Hate, or Unte Per Cent, is the decimal
which denotes how many hundredths of a number are to
be taken. Thus, 5% = -^fa —.05: . 05 is the rate per cent.
If the decimal be reduced to a common fraction in its lowest terms,
this fraction win still be the equivalent rate, though not the rate
per cent.
367. The Base is the number to which the rate is
applied. Thus, in the expression Q% of $25, the base
is $25.
368. Percentage is the result obtained by apply-
ing the rate to the base. Thus, in the statement, 5% of
$40 is $2, .05 is the rate per cent, $40, the base, and $2,
the percentage.
369. The Amount is the sum of the base and the
percentage. Thus, if the base is $40, and the percentage
$2, the amount is $40 + $2 = $42.
370. The Difference is the remainder found by
subtracting the percentage from the base. Thus, if the
base is $40, and the percentage $2, the difference is
$40 - $2 = $38.

378. Profit and Loss are commercial terms used
to express the gain or loss in business transactions.
379. Profits and losses are usually estimated at some
rate per cent on the cost, or on the money or capital
invested.
380. Four cases occur which involve the same prin-
ciples and operations as those of Percentage already
considered.
The corresponding terms are the following:
The Base, is the Cost, or capital invested.
The Kate, is the per cent of profit or loss.
The Percentage, is the profit or loss.
The Amount, is the cost plus the gain, or the Sell-
ing Price.
The Difference, is the cost minus the loss, or the
Selling Price.
254 PERCENTAGE.
381. 1. A watch that cost $80 sold for 20$ more than
cost. What was the gain, and the selling price?

Hence the following
399. PRINCIPLES. — 1. The interest of any sum at G%,
is ONE-HALF as many hundredths of the principal, as
there are MONTHS in the given time.
2. The interest of any sum at Q%, is ONE-SIXTH as
many thousandths of the principal, as there are DATS in
the given time.
Thus, the interest on any sum at 6$ for 1 yr. 5 mo., equal to
17 mo., is £ of .17, or .085 of the principal ; and for 24 da. it is ¿
of .024, or .004 of the principal. Hence for 1 yr. 5 mo. 24 da., it
is .085 + .004 = .089 of the principal.
It is evident that an odd month is i of .01, or .005 ; and any
number of days less than 6, is such a fractional part of .001 as the
days are of 6 days.

METRIC SYSTEM.
430. The Metric System of weights and meas-
ures is based upon the decimal scale.
431. The Meter is the base of the system, and is
the one ten-millionth part of the distance on the earth's
surface from the equator to either pole, or 39.37079 inches.
432. From the Meter are made the Are (air), the
¿Here (stair), the Liter (leeter), and the Gram; these con-
stitute the primary or principal units of the system from
which all the others are derived.
METRIC SYSTEM.
433. The Multifile Units, or higher denomina-
tions, are named by prefixing to the name of the pri-
mary units the Greek numerals, Deka (10), Hecto (100),
Kilo (1000), and Myra (10000).
434. The Sub-multiple Units, or lower denomi-
nations, are named by prefixing to the names of the pri-
mary units the Latin numerals, Den (fa}, Centi
Miue
Hence, it is apparent from the name of a unit, whether
it is greater or less than the standard unit, and also how
many times.
MEASURES OF EXTENSION.

KERL'S
SH0RTER C0URSE IN ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
KERL'S SHORTER COURSE was published about two years
ago, and has met with unrivalled popularity and success. It is safe to say
Ameritan; (Sburational Smes.
Its excellent arrangement, the many new and valuable features introduced,
and the thorough adaptation of the work throughout to the present wants
of our schools, are among its most obvious merits.
This book is the result of much study, experience and reflection, and no
pains have been spared to set it beyond all just grounds of critical censure.
The condition and wants of the schools, as they now are, both in this
country and in Europe, have been carefully considered, as well as the
advanced state of philological science, and the work has been modified
accordingly, so as to place it in the front rank of new and improved pro-
ductions.
The following are some of the points to which special attention isinvited:
ist The book is small, and yet is sufficiently comprehensive in outline,
and ntt deficient in necess(ry detail,
2d. It consists of an oral course followed by a course of Text in accord-
ance with the method of teaching into which the best schools have gradually
fallen by experience.
3d. The classification throughout is new, original, and probably the most
simple and natural ever given in a grammar.
4th. All things relating to the same subject have been broueht together,
while all trashy incumbrances, all useless generalities, and all quackery
of expedients have been carefully excluded.
The book excels in method, clearness, pithiness, brevity and complete-
ness; in its definitions, illustrations, and exercises ; in practical utility and
adaptation to the school-room, and it is strictly NATIVE,—not an imitation of
Latin or Greek Grammars.
A new, thorough and Practical Grammar, admirably adapted to ike use
of Common Schools, and to the general wants of American Teachers* 250
^ages. Price75 cents. By mail on receipt of price.

B0TANY.
STANDARD TEXT BOOKS. By ASA GRAY, M. D., Fisher Professor,
Harvard University. More extensively in use than all others combined.
This justly celebrated Series of Text-Books presents the latest and most
accurate principles and developments of the beautiful science to which
Professor GRAY has devoted so much of his life. None have yetapproached
him in the rare art of making purely scientific theories and dry details pop-
ular and interesting. From his charming elementary work. How Plants
Grow," to his more elaborate " Manual, there is one simple, concise, and
yet exhaustive method of treating the various grades of the science. Flow-
ery rhetoric, beautiful figures, lofty speculations, and romantic fancies are
discarded, and in place is given a simplicity of statement, a transparency of
language, and an enthusiasm which lights up every page, and causes the
student to enter readily into the authors spirit. The leading scientific men
of this country and Europe have awarded the highest place in the Galaxy
of Botanists to Professor GRAY.
From Prof. J. S. DAVIS, Prof. Anatomy, Materia Medica^ and Botany ', Uni~
versity of Virginia*
"Prof. Gray's books are of such singular excellence that they leave
nothing to be desired. Their style is so simple, their statements so lucid,
and their arrangement so judicious, that they may be placed in the hands of
children: while they are so instinct with true science, and breathe so philo-
sophic a spirit that their perusal affords a delightful recreation to the mature
and the cultivated.
"Botany should be taught in every school, and these volumes should
be the text-books."
The celebrated scientist of London, Dr. LINDLEY, says: "Dr- GRAY
stands confessedly at the head of the science of Botany in the United States,
and among the highest in all countries."
Sir WILLIAM HOOKER, Royal Botanist of England, says; u Few men
have ever equaled him (GRAY) in scientific research, or excelled him in sci-
entific deduction."
Prof. JOHN TORREY, the famous American botanist and scientist, says:
"Professor GRAY is well known as the most eminent theoretical and practical
botanist in our country; and his op ortunities for acquiring an extensive
and accurate knowledge of the plants of North America have been such
as no other person has enjoyed."
Prof. GUYOT, of Princeton College, says: "Not only is Dr. GRAY
acknowledged to stand at the head of Botanical science in this country, but
his works have been appreciated and noted abroad for the thoroughness
and admirable method, the precision, and the singular clearness of language
which distinguish them."
