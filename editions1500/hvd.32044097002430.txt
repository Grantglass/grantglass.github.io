PREFACE.
THE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the
study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a preparation for busi-
ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the
hinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture,
an not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary study for
young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as
a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it
is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and
ready students of mathematics are those who have been most
thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic.
This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes,
and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the
primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written
arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer-
cised in this branch of study.
Only a few of the many points of difference between this and
other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior
to them, will be referred to.
It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive in its char-
acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys-
tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical
science. The development of principles, and their applications,
are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of
appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with
those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com-
plex and difficult.
At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap-
ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles,
and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every
principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough
review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what
he has been over.
One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most
original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and
uniform system of ANALYSIS it contains, — the result of long expe-
rience in the school-room.
Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per-
centage, and Interest; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to
obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the
operations in them.
The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable
and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge-
bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they
may be considered difficult, yet the füll analysis given of every
principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions
of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult
fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy•1
In conclusion. wo may be allowed to express the belief, tlia;
in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long
sought in this department of science,—the means of mental dis-
cipline and development such as has been furnished by no
similar treatise.
THE AUTHOB.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be
classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the
class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine
their lesson before being called upon to recite.
The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly
•prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons
in the latter part of the work.
Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly,
the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand
erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This wü
secure close attention.
Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and
the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given,
unless better ones can be substituted; and in no case should he
be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore'
The class should be encouraged to detect and correct errors in
statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all
of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand.
It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon
"Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which
may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It
will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening
exercise.

of the same kind into one equivalent number. The result
is called the Sum or Amount. The sign of addition is
written thus, +, and is called plus. When placed between
two numbers or quantities, it shows that they are to be
added together. Thus, 5 -f- 3 -j- 2 signifies that 5 and 3
and 2 are to be added together, and is read ßve, plus three,
plus two.
The sign of equality is written thus, =. When placed

and is read minus. Placed between two numbers, or quan-
tities, it shows that the one after it is to be taken from the

equal to 3 tens and 4 units; 3 tens from 5 tens leave 2 tens,
or 20, and 4 units from 1 units leave 3 units, which added
to 20 make 23. Therefore, 57 — 34 = 23.

contain one of two given numbers as many times as there aro units iu
the other; the result is called tho Product.
The sign of multiplication is written thus, x, and, placed
between two numbers or quantities, shows that they are to
be multiplied together. 5 x 4 — 20, shows that 5 multi-
plied by 4 is equal to 20. The sign is commonly called
times. 5 x 4 is read 5 times 4.

A Simple Number contains but one name or denomina-
tion; thus, 5,84,12 bushels, 65 dollars, are simple numbers.
A Compound Number contains two or more names or
denominations; thus, 5 dollars 25 cents, 16 bushels 3 pecks,
8 days 10 hours, are compound numbers.
Reduction is the process of changing numbers from one
denomination to another, without altering their value; thus,
changing pounds to ounces, ounces to pounds, dollars to
cents, &c., is reduction.

FRACTIONS.
37. 1. WHAT is understood by one half, oru
fiird, one fourth, one fifth, &c. 'Í
ANS. When a number or thing, as a unit or an
apple, is divided into two equal parts, each of the
parts is called one half; when into three equal parts,
each of the parts is called one third; two of the parts
are called two thirds, &c.
2. How many halves in 1?
3. How many thirds in 1?
4. If a peach be divided into 2 equal parts, what
is each part called?
5. If an orange be divided into 3 equal parts,
what are the parts called?
6. How many halves in 4?
ANALYSIS. /Since in 1 there are 2 halves, in 4 there are 4
times 2 halves, or 8 halves. Therefore there are 8 halves in 4.
7. How many halves in 5? in 6?
8. How many halves in 7? in 7 and 1 half?
9. How many thirds in 3? in 4? in 5?

ANALYSIS. Since in 2 halves there is one whole thing,
in 8 haloes there are as many whole things as 2, the num-
ber of halves in 1, is contained times in 8, which is 4
limes. Therefore, in 8 halves there are 4 whole things.

86. INTEREST is a sum paid for the use of borrowed
money, or on demands after they become due.
The PRINCIPAL is the money lent, or the sum for which
interest is paid.
The AMOUNT is the sum of the principal and interest.
The RATE PER CENT. is the sum paid for the use of
$100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for
the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent. per
annum.
The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain
number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest
of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredtht
86.] INTELLECTUAL ARITHMETIC. 129
dredths (T§D) or r^ of the principal.
Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12
months a year, in computing interest. When no time is
named, one year is always understood.
The rate of interest is established by law; and taking
more than such rates is termed usury.

1. What principal will, in 3 years 4 months,
at 5 per cent, amount to $700.
ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years í months, at 5
fer cent., is £ of the principal, (88,) the principal |, added
to the interest ¿, equals the amount %; hence $700 is % of

If a given principal gain 5 per cent. in 1 year, it will re-
quire as many years to gain 25 per cent. as 5 per cent. it
contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, fyc.

9. In what time will any given principal double
tself at 4 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since, to double itself, any sum of money

coat, plus $3, equals tho cost of the vest; what is the
cost of each?
16. Wilson has 15 oranges and lemons; \ of the
orangos equals ^ of the lemons; how many of each
has he?
ANALYSIS. Since ¿ of the oranges equals $ of the lemons,
f, or all tfie oranges, equal § of the lemons; we then have
the oranges und lemons divided into 5 equal parts, 2 parts
cf which equal the oranges, ar.d 3 the lemons, fyc.

•the value of what is in it; what is the purse worth?
21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied,
"The time past noon is equal to £ of the time to
midnight." What was the hour?
ANALYSIS. The time to midnight is divided into 5 equal
parts, one of which equals the time past noon; then 5 parís
plus 1 part equals 6 parís ;and 12 hours, (he time from
noon to midnight, must be ^ of the time it lacked of being
midnight; since 12 is £, £. which is ¿ of ^, will be £ of 12
hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock,
P.M.
22. What was the time, provided f of the timo
past midnight equaled the time to 10 o'clock, A. M.?

7. A rope was cut into 3 pieces; the first piece
was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first
plus \ of the third, and the third was as long as the
other two; what was the length of the rope?
ANALYSIS. Since (he th ird piece is as long as the other
two, it must be % of the rope ; the second piece, being è an
'•ong, is \ ; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds ¿, with
the 5 feet of the first piece, makes 10 feet, which muât be the
other fourth; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, &o.

with; when they quit, each had the same number;
how many had both?
ANALYSIS. Since Henry won as many as lie liad. lie lefl
off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles,
now having the same number, must have had 3 times as
many as Henry when fliey commenced flayiny. 45 is 3
times $ of 45, or 15, and 45 -(- 15 is 60. Therefore, fyc.

APPENDIX.
THE author desires to call the attention of teachers to the number and
»ariety of changes that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec-
tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many
ptheis of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Ring-
ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap-
plied to all the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited
according to the time and convenience of the teacher.
It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these
'changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening
effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities
they afford for thorough mental discipline; and while, at first, to some
they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become
easy and comprehensible.
To aid beginners, the blackboard maybe used to advantage; and to
illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section
71, page 17 1-3: —
^ of 35 is if of how many thirds of 18?
which may be written on the board thus : —
f X 35 = $x ? X 18?
Call upon seme pupil to read the question according to thcjirst form,
and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given; and
the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of the
question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus :—
which is read
^ of 35 is £ of § of what number?
Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been
erased, and replaced by solution.
When the class have become familiar with the exercise, the uso of the
blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring
the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read.
Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil,
but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been
previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid
monotonous repetition.
Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en-
couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or
solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly
and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence
operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions. and conclu-
sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises
the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re-
sume where the last one left off; and so on.
A. teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot
conceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that
maybe created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this
exercise; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself
to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.

THE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the
study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a preparation for busi-
ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the
hinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture,
an not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary study for
young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as
a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it
is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and
ready students of mathematics are those who have been most
thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic.
This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes,
and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the
primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written
arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer-
cised in this branch of study.
Only a few of the many points of difference between this and
other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior
to them, will be referred to.
It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive in its char-
acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys-
tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical
science. The development of principles, and their applications,
are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of
appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with
those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com-
plex and difficult.
At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap-
ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles,
and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every
principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough
review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what
he has been over.
One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most
original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and
uniform system of ANALYSIS it contains, — the result of long expe-
rience in the school-room.
Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per-
centage, and Interest; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to
obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the
operations in them.
The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable
and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge-
bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they
may be considered difficult, yet the füll analysis given of every
principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions
of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult
fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy•1
In conclusion. wo may be allowed to express the belief, tlia;
in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long
sought in this department of science,—the means of mental dis-
cipline and development such as has been furnished by no
similar treatise.
THE AUTHOB.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be
classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the
class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine
their lesson before being called upon to recite.
The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly
•prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons
in the latter part of the work.
Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly,
the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand
erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This wü
secure close attention.
Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and
the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given,
unless better ones can be substituted; and in no case should he
be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore'
The class should be encouraged to detect and correct errors in
statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all
of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand.
It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon
"Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which
may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It
will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening
exercise.

16. Multiplication is the process of finding a number which shall
contain one of two given numbers as many times as there aro units iu
the other; the result is called tho Product.
The sign of multiplication is written thus, x, and, placed
between two numbers or quantities, shows that they are to
be multiplied together. 5 x 4 — 20, shows that 5 multi-
plied by 4 is equal to 20. The sign is commonly called
times. 5 x 4 is read 5 times 4.

to 2 tens and 3 units; 3 times 3 units are 9 units, and 3
times 2 tens are 6 tens, or 60; 60 and 9 are 69. Therefore,
if 1 cow cost 23 dollars, 8 cows will cost 69 dollars.

Reduction is the process of changing numbers from one
denomination to another, without altering their value; thus,
changing pounds to ounces, ounces to pounds, dollars to

86. INTEREST is a sum paid for the use of borrowed
money, or on demands after they become due.
The PRINCIPAL is the money lent, or the sum for which
interest is paid.
The AMOUNT is the sum of the principal and interest.
The RATE PER CENT. is the sum paid for the use of
$100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for
the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent. per
annum.
The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain
number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest
of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredtht
86.] INTELLECTUAL ARITHMETIC. 129
dredths (T§D) or r^ of the principal.
Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12
months a year, in computing interest. When no time is
named, one year is always understood.
The rate of interest is established by law; and taking
more than such rates is termed usury.

93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent., will f 60
gain $ 15 interest?
ANALYSIS. The gain, or interest, is £$, or ¿ of the prin*
cipal, equal to 25 per cent. of the principal. (7«j Ex. 7.)
If a given principal gain 5 per cent. in 1 year, it will re-
quire as many years to gain 25 per cent. as 5 per cent. it
contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, fyc.
Or thus: Since $60 in 1 year, at 5 per cent., will gain
$3 interest, it will require as many years for $60 to gain

9. In what time will any given principal double
tself at 4 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since, to double itself, any sum of money

ceived $18 interest; what was the rate per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is

of the principal, equal to 6 per cent. Therefore. fyc.
Or, thus: At 1 per cent., the interest of $i fur 4 years is
A cents, and of $75 it is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300
cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent. of $75
for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent. as $3 te
contained times in $18, which is G times, equal to 6 per
cent.

12. At what per cent. will $2500 gain $200 in-
terest in 1 year and 4 months?
13. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 5 years?
ANALYSIS. Since a given principal must gain 100 per
cent. to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will
require % of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, fyc.
14. At what per cent. will a given principal double

4 each, the rest 3 apiece, except 2, who obtained but
2 apiece; how many were there in the party?
ANALYSIS. Had the last 2 obtained 3 each, there would
have been 28 melons; then 4 times £ of a number, plus 3
times ¿ of the same number, or £, would equal 28. Since
28 is | of a number, | of 28, or 4, is ¿, and 4 is £ of 2
times 4, or 8. Therefore, ige.

ANALYSIS. If all hud been good, he would have paid
Ç15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones
made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as many
bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel)
is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on all,) which is
8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones; the difference be-

1O7. 1. Two boys are running in the same,
direction; one is 27 rods in advance of the other in
pursuit, who gains upon the foremost 3 rods in a
minute; in how many minutes will he be overtaken?
ANALYSIS. In as many minutes as 3, the number of rods
gained in one minute, is contained times in 27, the number
of rods to be gained.
2. A,'after traveling 2 hours, at the rate of 5
miles an hour, was followed by B, at the rate of 7
miles an hour; in how many hours would B over-
take A?
3. A dog in pursuit of a hare which has 28 rods
the start, runs 9 rods while the hare runs 7; how far
will the dog run to catch the hare?
4. Henry saves $5 while John saves $ 7; how
much will each have when the difference between
what each has saved is $30?

ANALYSIS. Since the minute hand passes the hour hand
11 times in 12 hours, if both are at 12, the minute hand will
pass the fionr hand the ßrst time in T'r of 12 hours, or in
If'j hours, equal to 5ft minutes pust 1 o'clock. There-
fore, êfC.
8. A gentleman, being asked the time, replied,
"It is between 3 and 4 o'clock, and the hands are
directly opposite." What was the time?
9. A fox is 40 leaps ahead of a hound, and takes
7 leaps to the hound's 4; but 3 of the hound's leaps
equal 6 of the fox's; how many leaps will the fox
take before being caught?
10. A wolf ran 80 rods to catch a sheep; f of the
distance the sheep ran was equal to the distance be-
tween them when the chase commenced; what was
the distance?
11. The sum of f of A's and f of B's money, being
on interest 2 years 7 months and 6 days, at 5 per
cent., amounted to $2260; | of B's money was 1|
times f of A's; how much hud each?
12. B's fortune is 1A times A's; the interest of ^
of A's fortune and \ of B's for 5 years, at 6 per cent.,
is $600; what is the fortune of each?
13. A drover paid $76 for calves and sheep, pay-
ing $3 apiece for calves and $2 for sheep; he sold \
of his calves and $ of his sheep for $23, and in so
doing lost 8 per cent. on their cost; how many of
each did he purchase?
THE author desires to call the attention of teachers to the number and
»ariety of changes that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec-
tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many
ptheis of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Ring-
ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap-
plied to all the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited
according to the time and convenience of the teacher.
It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these
'changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening
effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities
they afford for thorough mental discipline; and while, at first, to some
they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become
easy and comprehensible.
To aid beginners, the blackboard maybe used to advantage; and to
illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section
71, page 17 1-3: —
^ of 35 is if of how many thirds of 18?
which may be written on the board thus : —
f X 35 = $x ? X 18?
Call upon seme pupil to read the question according to thcjirst form,
and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given; and
the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of the
question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus :—
which is read
^ of 35 is £ of § of what number?
Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been
erased, and replaced by solution.
When the class have become familiar with the exercise, the uso of the
blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring
the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read.
Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil,
but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been
previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid
monotonous repetition.
Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en-
couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or
solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly
and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence
operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions. and conclu-
sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises
the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re-
sume where the last one left off; and so on.
A. teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot
conceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that
maybe created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this
exercise; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself
to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.
