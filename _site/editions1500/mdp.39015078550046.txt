PREFACE-
IF ever the story of any private man's
adventures in the world were worth mak-
ing public, and were acceptable when
published, the Editor uf this account
thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man's life exceed
all that (he thinks) is to be found extant;
the life of one man being scarce capable
©f a greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with
seriousness, and with a religious applica-
tion of events to the uses to which wise
men always apply them, viz. to the in-
struction of others by this example, and
to justify and honor the wisdom of Prov-
idence in all the variety of our circum-
stances, let them happen how they will.
. The editor believes this narrative to btf

a just history of fact; neither is there any
appearance of fiction in it: and tho' he is
•well aware there are many, who on ac-
count of the very singular preservations
the author met with, will give it the name
of romance; yet, in whichever of these
lights it shall be viewed, he imagines, that
the improvement of it, as well as the di-
version, as to the instruction of the read-
er, will be the same; and as such, he
thinks, without farther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in
the publication.
THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF '.'••'
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
-V ':• .''
I WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of a reputa-
ble family. My lather was a native of Bremen, who by
merchandising at Hull for some time, gained a very
plentiful fortune. He married my mother at York, who
received her first breath in that country: and as her
maiden name was Robinson, I was called ROBINSON
KRE ufZNAER: which not being easily pronounced in the
English tongue, we are commonly known by the name
of CRUSOE.
I was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was
a lieutenant colonel in Lockhart's rngirnent, but slain by
the Spaniards: what became of the other, I could never
learn.
No charge or pains were wanting in my education.—
My father designed me for the law ; yet nothing would
serve me but I must goto sea, both against the will of my
father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of
friends. One morning my father expostulated very
warmly with me: What reason, says he, have you to
leave your native country, where there must be a more
certain prospect of content and happiness, to enter into a
wandering condition of uneasiness and uncertainty? He
recommended to me Agur's wish, "Neither to desire
poverty nor riches:" that a middle state of Hie was the
most happy, and that the high towering thoughts of rais-
ing our condition by wandering abroad, were surrounded
with misery and danger, and often ended with confusion
and disappointment. I entreat you, nay, 1 command yoii
(says he) to desist from these intentions. Consider your
elder brother^who laid down his life for his honor, or ra-
ther lost it for his disobedience to my will If you will go
(added he) my prayers shall however be offered for your
preservation; but a time may come, when desolate, op-

pressed, or forsaken, you may wish you had taken your
poor despised father's counsel.—He pronounced these
words with such a moving and paternal eloquence, while
floods of tears run down his aged cheeks, that it seemed
to stem the torrent of my resolution. But this soon wore
off, and a little after I informed my mother, that I could
not settle to any business, my resolutions were so strong
to see the world; and begged she would gain my father's
consent only to go one voyage; which, if I did not prove
prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But my de-
sirt: was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother passi-
onately expressed her disfike of this proposal,telling me,
"That as she saw I was bent upon my own destruction,
"contrary to their will and my duty, she would say no
"more, but leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased.''
I was ;hen, I think, nineteen years old, when one time
being at Hull, I met a. school-fellow of mine, going along
•with his father, who was master of a ship, to London, and'
acquainted him with my wandering desires; he assured
me of a free passage,and a plentiful share of what was ne-
cessary. Thus, without imploring a blessing, or taking
farewell of my parents,I took shipping on the first ofSep-
tember 165). We set sail soon after, and our ship had
scarce left the Humber a-stern, when there arose so vio-
lent a storm, that being extremely sea-sick, 1 concluded
the judgment of God deservedly followed me for my dis-
obedienee to my dear parents. It was then I called to
mind the good advice of my father; how easy and com-
fortable was a middle state of life; and I firmly resolved,
if it pleased God to set me on dry land once more, I
would return to my parents, implore their forgiveness,
and bid a final adieu to my wandering incliaations.
Such were my thoughts while the storm continued, but
these good resolutions decreased with the danger; more
especially when my companion came tome, clapping me
«n the shoulder: "What Bob !" said he, "sure you was
"not frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind?"
"And do you," cried 1, " call such a violent storm a cap-
••* ful of wind ?" " A storm, you fool you," said he, "this
"is nothing ; a good ship and sea-room always baffles
"such a foolish squall of wind as that: but you're a fresh
"water sailor: Come boy, turn out,see what fine weather
"we have now, and a good bowl of punch will drown all
." your past sorrows." In short, the punch was made, I
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. f
was drunk and in one night's time drowned both my re-
pentance and my good resolutions, forgetting entirely the
vows and promises I made in my distress: and whenever
any reflections would return on me, what by company,
and what by drinking, I soon mastered those fits, as I
deridiugly called them. But this only mude way for
another trial, whereby I could not but see how much I
was beholden to a kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind-bound -with some New-castle
ships ; and there being good anchorage, and our cables
sound, the seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and
spent the time as merry as if they had been on shore. But
on the eighth day there arose a brisk gale of wind.which
prevented our tidmg it up the river; and still increasing,
our ship rode forecastle in,and shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the seamen them-
selves, and I heard the master e -press this melancholy
ejaculation "Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all
"lost and undone !" For my part, sick unto death. I kept
my cabin till the universal and terribly dreadful appre-
hensions of our speedy fate made me get upon deck; and
there I was affrighted indeed The sea went mountains
high : I could see nothing but distress around us; two
ships had cut their masts on board, and another was toun-
dered ; two more that had lost their anchors, were forctd
out to the mercy of the ocean; and to save our lives we
were forced to cut our foremast and mainmast quite
away.
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dread-
ful condition? I was but a fresh-water sailor, and therefore
it seemed more terrible. Our ship was very good, but
overloaded ; which made the sailors often cry out, " She
"would founder ?" words I then was ignorant of. All this
while the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the
master and the most sober part of his men went to pray-
ers, expecting death every moment. In the middle of the
night one cried out, " We had sprung a leak ;" another,
"That there was four teet water in the hold." I was ;iist
ready to expire with fear, when immediately all hands
were called to the pump; and the men forced me also in
that extremity to share with them in their labour. While
thus employed, the master espying some light colliers,
fired a gun as a signal of distress; and I, not undemand-
ing what it meant, and thinkingthat either the ship broke
or some dreadful thing happened.fell into a swoon. Even
in that common condition of woe,nobody minded me,ex-
cepting to thrust me aside with their feet, thinking me
dead, and it was a great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us,when upon the signal given, they
ventured out their boats to save our lives. All our pump-
ing had been in vain, and vain had all our attempts been,
had thty not come to our ship's side, and our men cast
them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, which after
great labour they got hold of, and we hauling them up to
us got into the boat, and left ourship,which we perceived
sink within less than a quarter of an hour; and thus I
learned what was meant by foundering at sea. And now
the men incessantly laboured to recover their own ship;
but the sea ran so high, and the wind blew so hard, that
they thought it convenient to hale within shore ; which
with great difficulty and danger, at last we happily effect-
ed, landing ut a place called Cramer, not far from Winter-
ton light-house; from whence we all walked toYarmouth,
where as objects of pity, many good people furnished us
•with necessaries to carry us either to Hull or London.
Strange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not
return to my father ; who hearing of the ship's calamity,
for a long time thought me entombed in the deep. No
doubt but I should have shared on his fatted calf, as the
scripture expresseth it; but my ill fate still pushed me
on in spite of the powerful conviction of reason and
conscience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along with his father. His behaviour and speech
•were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me how
1 did, t' lling his father who I was, and how I had made
Ihisvoyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Up-
on which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said,
"Young man you ought never to go to sea any more, but
"to take this for a certain sign that you never will pros-
"per in a seafaring condition." " Sir," answered I," will
'' you take the same resolution?" " It is a different case,"
said he, " it is my culling, and consequently my duty;
"but as you have made this voyage for a trial, you see
"what ill success Heaven has set before your eyes; and
"herhaps our miseries have been on your account, like
» Jonah in the ship of Tarshisti. But pray what are you,
"and on wnat accwunv did you go to sea?" Upon whici
I very freely declared my whole story: at the end of which
he made this exclamation :" Ye sacred powers; what had
•' I committed, that such a wretch should enter into my
"ship to heap upon me such a deluge of miseries !" But
soon recollecting his passion, '1Young man,"said he," if
"you do not go back, depend upon it, wherever you go, you
"will meet with disasters and disappointments till your
"father's words are fulfilled unto you."And so we parted.
I thought at first to return home ; but shame opposed
that good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by
my neighbours and acquaintance. So strange is the na-
ture of youth, who are not ashamed to sin, but yet asham-
ed to repent; and so far from being ashamed of those ac-
tions for which they may be accounted fools, they think it
folly to return to their duty, which is the principal mark
of wisdom. In short, I travelled up to London, resolving
upon a -vuyagc , and «. voyage I soon heard of, by my ac-
quaintance with a captain who took n fancy to me, to go
to the coast of Guinea. Having some money, and appear*
ing like a gentleman, I went on board, not as a common
sailor or foremast man ; nay, the commander agreed I
should go that voyage with him without any expence;
that I should be his messmate and companion, and I was
very welcome to carry any thing with me, and make the
best merchandise I could.
I blessed ray happy fortune, and humbly thanked my
captain for this offer; and acquainting my friends in
Yorkshire, forty pounds were sent to me, the greatest
part of which my dear father and mother contributed to,
with which I bought toys and trifles, as the captain di-
rected me. My captain also taught me navigation how to
keep an account of the ship's course, take an observation,
and led me into the knowledge of several useful branches
of the mathematics. And indeed this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant ; for 1 brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which
produced, at my return to London, almost three hundred
pounds. But in this voyage I was extremely sick, being
thro-.vn into a violent calenture through the excessive
heat,trading upon the coast from the latitude of fifteen de-
grees north, even to the line itself.
But alas ! my dear friend the captain soon departed this
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me ; yet
I resolved to go another voyage with his mate, who ha<*
now got command of the ship. This proved a very unsuc-
cessful one ; for though I did not carry quite a hundred
pounds of my late acquired wealth (so that I had two hun-
dred pounds left, which I reposed with the captain's wi-
dow, who was an honest gentlewoman) yetmy misfortunes
in this unhappy voyage were very great. Forourship sail-
ing towards the Canary islands, We were chased hy a Sa-
lee rover ; and in spite of all the haste we could make, by
crowding as much canvass as our yards could spread, or
our masts carry,the pirate gained upon us,so that we pre-
pared ourselves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and
we had but twelve. About three in the afternoon there
•was a desperate engagement, wherein many were killed
and wounded on both sides; but finding ourselves over-
powered with numbers, our ship disabled, and ourselves
too impotent to have the least hopes of success,we were
forced to surrender; and accordingly were all carried
prisoners into the port of Salee. Our men were sent to
the Emperor's court to be sold there ; but the pirate cap-
tain taking notice of me, kept me to be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable,
creature on earth, and the prophecy of my father came
afresh into my thoughts. However, my condition was bet-
ter than I thought it to be, as soon will appear. Some
hopes indeed I had that my new patron would go to sea
again, where he might be taken by a Spanish or Portu-
guese man of war,and then I should be set at liberty. But
in this I was mistaken ; for he never took me with him,
but left me to look after his little garden, and do the drud-
gery of his house,and when he returned from sea, would
make me lie in the cabin, and look after the ship. I had
no one that I could communicate my thoughts to, which
were continually meditating my escape ; no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman here, but myself ; and for two
years I could see nothing practicable, but only pleased
myself with the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew
so poor that he could not fit out his ship as usual; and
then he used constantly, once or twice a week, if the wea-
thor was fair, to go out a fishing, taking me and a young
Moresco boy to row the boat; and so much pleased was
he with me for my dexteriiy in catching the fish, that
he would often send me wi'h a Moor, who was one of
his kinsmen, and the Movesco youth, to catch a dish <jf
fi,sh for him.
One morning, as we were at the sport, there arose such
a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore; and rowing we
knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. However, we attained there at length, and made
the greater haste,because our stomachs were exceedingly
sharp and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for
the future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little
state room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat with a
place behind it to steer and haul home the main sheet,with
other conveniences to keep him from the weather, as also
lockers to put in all manner of previsions, with a hand-
some shoulder of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a fishing; and one
time inviting two or three persons of distinction to go with
him, made provision extraordinary, providing also three
fusees with lewder and shot, that they might have some
sport at fowling along the sea-coast. The next morning
the boat was made clean, her ancient and pendants out,
and every thing ready ; but their minds altering, my pa-
tron ordered us to go a fishing, for that his guests would
certainly sup with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In
order to this I .persuaded the Moor to get some provisions
on board, as not daring to meddle with ourpatron's ; and
be taking my advice, we stored ourselves with rusk, bis-
cuit, and three jars of water. Besides, I privately convey-
ed into the boat a bottle of brandy, some twine, thread,
a hammer, hatchet and a saw; and in particular, some
bees-wax, which was a great comfort to m«, and served to
make candles. I then persuaded Muley vfor so was the
Moor called) to procure some powder and shot pretend-
ing to kill sea-curleus, which he innocently and readily
agreed to. In short, being provided with all things neces-
sary, we sailed out, resolving for my own part to make my
escape, though it should cost me my life.
When we had passed the castle, we fell a fishing; but
though I knew there was a bite, I dissembled the matter
in order to put further out to sea. Accordingly we ran a
Ipague further; when giving the boy the helm, and pret-
emling to stoop forsomething, I seizedMuley by surprise
and threw him overboard. As he was an excellent swim-
mer, he soon arose andm'ade towards the boat; upon which
I wok out afusee, and presented at him:" Muley," said I,
"I never yet designed to do you any harm, and seek no-
"thing now but my redemption. I know you are able
"enough to swim to shore and save your life ; but if you
"art resolved to follow me to the endangering of mine,
"the very moment you proceed, I will shoot you through
"the head." The harmless creature at these words, turn-
ed himselffrom me,and 1 make no doubt got safe to land.
Then turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at
the action ; but I put him out of all fear, telling him, that
if he would be true aud faithful to me, I would do well by
him "And therefore, " said I, " you must stroke your
"face to be faithful; and, as the Turks have learnedyou,
"e wear by Mihomet, and the beard of your father, or else
"I willthrowyou into the sea also." So innocent did the
child then look,and with such an obliging smile consent-
ed, that 1 readily believed him,and from that day forward
began to love him entirely.
We then pursued our voyage; and lest they should think
me gone to the Straits'mouth, I ki-puo the south ward to
the truly Barbarian coast; but, in the dusk of the evening,
I changed my course, and steering directly S. and by E.
that I might keep near the shore, and having a fresh gale
of wind, with a y--}easant smooth sea, by three o'clock next
'day I was one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Einpe-
ror of Morocco's dominions. Yet still having the dreadful
apprehension of being retaken, I continued sailing for five
days successively, till such time as the wind shifting to the
southward, made me conclude, that ifany vessel was in the
chase of me, they would proceed no further. After so much
fatigue and thought, I anchored at the mouth of a little
river. I knew not what or where ; neither did 1 see any
people What 1 principally wanted was fresh water ; and
I was resolved about dusk to swim ashore. But no sooner
did the gloomy clouds ol night begin to succeed the de-
clining d», when we heard such harking, roaring, and
howling ofwild creatures,thatone might have thought the
very strongest monsters of nature, or infernal spirits had
their residence there. Poor-Xury, almost dead with fear
entreated me not to go on shore thatnight. " Supposing I
"don't, Xury," said I," and in the morning we should see
"men who are worse than those we fear, what then ?" • O
"den we may give dem de shoot gun," replied Xury,
laughing," and de gun rnt>ke dem hll run away." The wit,
and broken Enghsh which the boy had learned among the
fcaplives of our nation, pleased me entirely : and to add to
his cheerfulness, I gave him a dram of the bottle: we
would get but little sleep all the night for those terrible
howlings they made ; and indeed we were both very muck
affrighted, when by the rollings of the water, and other
tokens, we justly concluded one of these monsters made
towards our boat. I could not see till it came within two
oars length, when taking my fusee, I let fly at him.
Whether I hit him or no, I cannot tell ; but he made to-
wards the shore, and the noise of my gun increased the
stupendous noise of the monsters.
The next morning I was resolved to go on shore to ge£
fresh water, and venture my life among the beasts or sav-
ages, should either attack me. Xury said he would take
one of the jars and bring me some. I asked him, why he
would go, and not I? The poor boy answered, " If wild
"man's come, they eat me, you go away." A mind
scarcely now to be imitated, so contrary to self-preserva-
tion, the most powerful law of Nature. This indeed in-
creased my affection to the child. "Well, dear Xury,"
said I, "we will both go ashore, both kill wild man's, and
"they shall eat neither of us." So giving Xury a piece of
rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we waded ashore, carrying
noth'ng with us but our arms, and two jars for wafer. I
did not go out of sight of the boat, as dreading the savages
coming down the river in their canoes; but the boy seeing
a low .descent or vale about a mile in the country, he wan-
dered to it: and then running back tome with great pre-
cipitation, I thought he was pursued by some savage or
wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving topeiish
or protect him from danger. As he came nearer to me,
I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which was a
creature he had shot like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer legs ; however, we were glad of it, for it prov-
ed wholesome and nourishing meat: but wHat added to
our joy was, my boy assured me ther&was plenty of wa-
ter, and that he see no iiiild mans. And greater still was
ourcomfort,when we found fresh water in the creek where-
we 'were when the tide was out, without going so far up
into the country.
'In this place, I began to consider that the Canary and
Cape deVerd is lands lay not far off; but having no instru-
ment, I Knew not what latitude, or when to stand off to
sea for them; yet my hopes were, I should meet some of
B
the English trading vessels, who would relieve and take
us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild country, in-
habited only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the negroes. It is filled with
•wild beasts, and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly.—
From this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain
Teneriff in the Canaries; which made me try twice t0
attain it; but as often was I drove back, and so forced to
pursue my fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high ; and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose
youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in
a soft tone, desired me to keep far from land, lest we
should be devoured. "For look yonder mayter," said he,
1' and see de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de
"hill." Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a
fearful monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that
lay on shore, covered as it were by a shade of a piece of
the hill •' Xury," said I, " you shall go on shore and kill
him." But the boy looked amazed: "Me kill him !" says
he, " he eat me at one mouth;" meaning one mouthful.
Upon which I bid him lie still, and charging my biggest
gun with two slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took
the best aim I could to shoot him thro' the head, but his
leg lying over his nose, the slug broke his knee-bone.
The lion awaking with the pain, got up, but soon fell
clown, giving the most hideous groan I ever heard : but
taking my second piece, I shot him through the head, and
then he lay struggling for life. Upon this Xury took heart
and desired my leave to go on shore. "Go then," said I.
Upon which taking a little gun in one hand, he swam to
shore with the other, and coming close to the lion, put a
period to hit life, by shooting him again through the head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh
not being good to eat Xury was like a champion, and
comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off the head of his
onemy; but not having strength to perform it, he cut off
and brought me a foot. I bethought me however, that
his skin would be of use. This work cost Xury and me a
whole day: when spreading it on the top of our cabin, the
hot beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days time>
and. it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our
provisions, and went no oftener on shore than we were
obliged for fresh water. My design was to make the ri-
ver Gambia or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de
Verd,in hopes to meet some European ship. If Providence
did not so favor me, my next course was to seek for the
islands, or lose my life among the negroes. And in a
word, I put my whole .stress upon this, "Either that I
"must meet with seme ship or certainly perish."
One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they
were black and stark naked. I was inclined to go on shore,
but Xury cried, " No,no;" however, I approached nearer,
and I found they run along the shore by me a good way.
They had no weapons in their hands, except one,whoheld,
a long slick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to them by-
signs and made them sensible I wanted something to eat 9
they beckoned me to stop my boat, while two of them ran
up into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh,
and some corn, which we kindly accepted; and to prevent
any fears on either side,they brought the food to the shore,
laid it down, then went and stood a great way off till wu
ibtched it on board, and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them, being all
we could afford, two mighty creatures came from the
mountains; one as it were pursuing the other with great
fury, which we were the rather inclined to believe, as they
seldom appear but in the night; and both these swiftly pas-
sing by the negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swim-
ming about, as tho' the diversion of the waters had put a
stop to their fierceness. At last one of them coming ner:-.
er to my boat than I expected or desired, I shot him di-
rectly through the head; upon which he sunk immediate1
]y, yet rising again, would have willingly made the shore;
but between tho wound and the strangling of. the water,
he died before he could reach it.
It is impossible to express the consternation the poor
negroes were in at the firing of my gun; much less can I
mention their surprise, when they perceived the creature
to be slain by it. I made signs to them to draw near it
with a rope, and then gave it them to haul on shore. It
was a beautiful leopard, which made me desire its skin •
and the negroes seemmg to covet the carcase, I ffsclf
gave it to them. As for the other leopard,it made to shore,
and ran with prodigious swiftness out of sight.The negroes
Jiaving kindly furnished me with water,and withwhat roots
and grains their country afforded, I took my leave, and
'after eleven days sail, came in siglit of the Cape de Verdi
•and those islands called by its name. But the great dist-
ance I was from it, and fearing contrary winds would pre-
vent my reaching them, I began to grow melancholy and
dejected, when upon a sudden Xury cried out," Master!
"Master I a ship with a sail!" and looked as affrighted as
If it was his master's ship sent in search of us. But I soon
discovered she was a Portuguese ship, as I thought bound
to the coast of Guinea for negroes. Upon which I strove
for life to come up to them. But vain had it been, if
through their perspective glasses they had net perceived
me and shortened their sail to let me come up Encour-
aged at this, I set up my patron's ancient, and fired a gun,
both as signals of distress; upon which they very kindly
Jay to, so that in three hours time I came up with them.
They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and French,
but neither of these did I understand ; till at length a Scots
sailor ca^Cd, and then I told him I was an Englishman,
who had escaped from the Moors at Salee; upon which
they took me kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at
this happy deliverance! who from being a late miserable
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favop
Avith the master of the ship, to whom, in return for my
deliverance I offered all I had. "God forbid," said he,
1' that I should take any thing from you. Every thing
"shall be delivered to you when you come to Brazil. If
"1 have saved your life, it is no more than I should ex-
*'pect to receive myself from any other,when in the same
<l circumstances I should happen to meet the like deliver-
'ance. And should I take from you what you have, and
'leave you at Brazil, why this would be only taking away
'a life I had given. My charity teaches me better.
'Those effects you have will support you there, and pro-
'vide you a passage home again." And indeed, he acted
with the strictest justice in what he did, taking my things
into his possession, and giving me an exact inventory,
even to my earthen jars. He bought my boat of me fcr
•flie ship's use, giving me a note of eighty pieces of eighty
payable at Brazil; and if any body offered more, he would
make it up. He also gave me sixty pieces for my boy
Xury. It was with great reluctance I was prevailed upon
to sell the child's liberty, who had served me so faithfully;
but the boy was willing himself; and it was agreed, that
after ten years he should be made free, upon his renounc-
ing Mahometanism, and embracing Christianity.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, on All Saints Bay, in twenty
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for ihe leopard's skin,
and thirty for the lion's, Every thing he caused to be de-
livered, and what I would sell he bought. In short I made
about 220 pieces of my cargo; and with this stock I en-
tered once more, as I may say into the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with
him till such time as I was informed of the manner of their
planting and making sugar; and seeing how well they
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with
a desire to settle among them and resolved to get my mo-
ney remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation,
To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to an hon-
est and kind neighbour,born at Lisbon, of English parents,
whose plantation joining to voirie, we improved it very
amicably together. Both our stocks were low, and for
two years we planted only for food : but the third year
we planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a large
piece of ground the ensuing year for planting canes. But
now I found how much I wanted assistance, and repented
the loss of my dear boy Xury,
Having none to assist me, my father's words came into-
my mind; and 1 used to ask myself, if what I sought was
only a middle station of life, why could it not as well be
obtained in England as here? When I pondered on this
with regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook
me. I had none to converse with but my neighbour; no
Xvork to be Bone but by my own hands; it often made-
me say, my condition was like to that of a man cast upon'
a desolate island. So unhappy are we in our reflections,
so forgetful of what good things we receive ourselves, and-
. so unthankful for our deliverance from those calamities
that others endure.
I was in some measure settled, before the captain -whd
look me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went
to him, and told him what stock 1 had in London, desir-
ing his assistance in getting it remitted; to which the
good gentleman readily consented.but would only have me
send for half my money, lest it should miscarry ; which
if it did, I might still have the remainder to support me;
and so taking letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble
myself no farther about it.
And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me;
for he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon
my captain's widow, but sent me over a servant with a car-
go proportionable to my condition. He also sent me over
tools of all sorts, iron work, and utensils necessary for my
•plantation, which proved to be of the greatest use to me
m my business.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon suc-
cess crowning my prosperous labours, I might have rest-
ed happy in that middle state of life my father had so often
recommended; yet nothing would content me, such was
my evil genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a
foolish ambition in rising ; and thusonce more,.I cast my-
self into the greatest gulph of misery that ever poor crea-
ture fell into. Having lived four years in Brazil, I had
not only learned the language, but contracted apquaint-
ance with the most eminent planters, and even the mer-
chants of St. Salvadore; to whom, once by way of dis-
course, having given an account of my two voyages to the
coast of Guinea, and the manner of trading there tor mere
trifles, by which we furnish our plantations with negroes,
they gave such attention to what I said, that three of them
came one morning to me, and told me they h?.d a secret
proposal to make. After enjoining me to secrecy (it be-
ing an infringment on the powers of the kings of Portu-
gal and Spain) they told me they hud a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with
negroes, which as they could not be publicly sold, they
•would divide among them ; and if I would go their super-
cargo in the ship, to manage the trading pdrt, 1 should
have an equal share of the negroes, without providing any
.jstock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in
another condition. But I, born to be my own destroyer
could not resist the proposal, but accepted the offer upon
condition, of ^r J§oki;•g after my plantation, So n>i»k}n£
a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good friend
the captain, as my universal heir; but obliged him to dis-
pose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce to
himself, and the other to be shipped to England
The ship being filled out, and all things ready, \ve set
sail the first of September, !659, being the same day eight
years I left my father and mother in Yorkshire. We sail-
ed northward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till
we made Cape Augustine ; from whence going farther in-
to the ocean, out of sight of land, we steered us though
we were bound for the isle of Fernand de Norenba, leaving
the islands on the east; and then it was that we met with'
a terrible tempest, which continued for twelve days suc-
cessively, so that the winds carried us wheresoever they
pleased. In this perplexity one of our men died, and one
man and a boy were washed overboard. When the weath-
er cleared up a little, we found ourselves eleven degrees
north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this the
captain gave reasons for returning, which I opposed,coun-
selling him to stand away for Barbadoes, which, as I sup-
posed might be attained in fifteen days. So altering our
course, v/e sailed northwest and by west, in order to reach
the Leeward islands ; but a second storm succeeding,
drove us to the westward; so that we wei e justly afraid
of falling into the hands of cruel savag$s, or the paws of
devourmg beasts of prey.
In this great distress, one of our men, early in the morn-
ing cried out, " Land, land !" which he had no sooner cri-
ed out, but our ship struck upon a sandbank, and in a mo-
ment the sea broke over her in such a manner that we ex-
pected we should all have perished immediately We knew
nothing where we were,or upon what land we were driven;
whether an island or the main, inhabited or not inhabited;
and we could not so much as hope that the ship would hold
out many minutes, without breaking in pieces,' except the
wind by a miracle should turn about immediately. While
•we stood looking at one another,expecting death every mo-
ment. The mate lays hold of the boat, and with the help of
the rest got her flung over the ship's bide, and getting all
into her, being eleven of us,committed ourselves to God's
mercy and the wild sea. And now we saw that this last ef-
fort would not be a sufficient protectionism death; so high
did the sea rise, that it was impossioleihe boat should live.
£s 10 making sail, we had none; neither if we had, could
we make use of any. So that when we had rowed] OP ra-
ther were driven about a league and a half, a raging wave,
like a lofty mountain, came rolling astern of us, and took
us with such fury, thai at once it overset the boat. Thus
being swallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to
call upon the tremendous name of God ; much less to
implore in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to re-
ceive our departing souls.
Men are generally counted insensible, when struggling
in the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with
•water, I had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable.
For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell,seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and
even small space of time, as it were between life a,nd death,
I was going I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal
gulph unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more ! Could I
even have thought of annihilation, or a total dissolution of
soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far-
ther being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an e-
ternal yuietus, without life or sense ; even that I say, would
have been enough to strike me with horror and confusion!
I strove however, to the last extremity, while all my com-
panions were overpowered and entombed in the deep: and
it was with great difficulty. 1 kept my breath till the wave
spent itself,and retiringbackjeftme on the shore half dead
•with the water I had taken in. As soon as I got on my feet,
I ran as fast as Icould,lest another wave should pursue me,
and carry me back again. But for all the haste 1 made, I
could not avoid it: for the sea came after me like a high
mountain, or furious enemy; so that my business was to
hold my breath, and by raising myself on the water, pre-
serve it by swimming. The nextdreadful wave buried me
at once twenty or thirty feet deep,but at the same time car-
ried me with a mighty force andswi&ness toward the shore;
•vrhen raising myself, I held out as well as possible, till at
length the water having spent itself, began to return, at
•which I struck forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I
took to my heels again. Thus being served twice more, I
was at length dashed against a piece of rock, in such a
manner as left me senseless; but recovering a littlebefore
the return of the wave, which no doubt would then have
overwhelmed me,I held fast by the rockjtill those succeed-
ing wares abated; and then fetching another run,
overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered,
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the
main land, where clambering up the cliffs of the shoret
tired and almost spent, 1 sat down on the grass, free from
the dangers of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstacies and transports that
my soul left at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve
toadying malefactor, with a nailer about his neck, and rea-
dy to be turned off. I was wrapt-up in contemplation, and
often lifted up my hands, with the profoundest humility, to
the Divine Powers, for saving my life, when the rest of my
companions were all drowned. And now I began to cast
my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and what I
had next to do. I could see no house nor people ; I was
wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet had nothing to cut or drink ; no weapon to destroy any
ereature for my sustenance nor defend myself against de-
vouring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a tobac-
co-pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The darksome
night coming on upon me, increased my fears of being de-
voured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged in des-
pair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life before
me, I prepared for another kind of death than what I had
lately escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I could
find any fresh water, which I did, to my great joy; and
taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, 1 got up into
a thick bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could not
fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried
»iy sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I awaked -r
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was a-
bout a mile from the place where I was. When I came
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived the
ship's boat two miles distant on my right hand, lying on,
shore, as the waves had cast her. I thought to have got to
her; but there.being an inlet of water of about half a mile's
breadth between it and me, I returned again towards the
ship, as hoping to find something for my more immediate
subsistence. About noon, when the sea was calm, that I
could come within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to my
grief I perceived, that, if we had kept on board all our lives
ij;ul been saved, These thoughts, and my solitude drevr
tears from my eyes,though all in vain. So resolving to get to
the ship, I stripped and leapt into the water, when swim-
ming round her I was afraid I should not get any thing to
lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to espy a small
piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that, by
the help of it, though with great difficulty, I got into the
fore-castle of the ship. Here Ifound that the ship was bulg-
ed, and had a great deal of water in her hold; her stern
•was lifted up against a bank, and her head almost to the
water. All her quarter and what was there, was free and
dry. The provisions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets, and losing no time, ate while I was
doing other things; I also found some rum, of which I
took a hearty dram; and now I wanted for nothing except
a boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what wa-s
needful for me.
'Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se-
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three
large spars of wood. With these 1 fell to work, and slung
as many of them overboard as I could manage, tying every
one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away.
This done, I went down to the ship's side, and tied four oS
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and lay-
ing two or three short pieces of plank upon them crosswise^
I found it would bear me, but not any considerable weight.
Upon which I went to work again cutting a spare topmast
into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal
of labour and pains. I then considered what I should load
it with, it being not able to bear a pondrous burden. And
this I soon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks-
and boards I could get; next I lowered down three of the
seamen's chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice,
three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dry goat's flesh, ami
some European corn, what little the rats had spared ; and
for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to
our skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and four
or five gallons of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By
this time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat,
waistcoat, and shirt, swim away, which I hud left on shore;
as for my linen-breeches and stockings, I swam with them
to the ship; but I soon found clothes enough, though I
took no more than I wanted for the present. My eyes
were chiefly on tools to work with; and. after a long search,
• I found oiit the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down on
my raft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and in,
the great cabin found two good fowling pieces, two pistols,
several powder horns filled a small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I likewise found three barrels of powder, two
of which were good, but the third had taken water, also two
or three broken oars, two saws, an ax. and a hammer. I
then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three encour-
agements. 1- A smooth calm sea. 3. The tide rising and
setting into shore. 3. The little wind there was blew to-
wards the land Alter I had sailed about a mile, I found
the raft to drive a little distance from the place where I
first landed ; and then I perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it :up-
on which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my rah ran
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty for near
half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone
into the sea. But after some time, the rising of the water
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, I landed in a little cove, as near
the mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail if any
such providentially passed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height sur-
rounded with lesser hills about it, and thither I was resol-
ved to go and view the country, that I might see what
part was best to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming
myself with a pistol, a fowling piece, powder and ball, I
ascended the mountain. There I perceived I was in an
island, encompased by the sea ; no distant lands to be seen
but scattering rocks that lay to the west: that it seemed
to be a barren place, and, as 1 thought, inhabited only by
wild beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls but ignorant
of what kind, or whether good for nourishment ; I shot
®ne of them at my return, which occasioned a confused
streaming among the other birds, and I found it by its co-
lours and beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh via.-, per-
fect carrion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on shore,
which work spent that day entirely ; and fearing that some
cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I
slept, 1 made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests
and boards I had brought on shore That night I slept
very comfortably; and the next morning my thoughts
were employed to make a further attempt on the ship, and
bring away whSt necessaries I could find, before another
storm should break her to pieces. Accordingly I got on
board as before, and prepared a second raft far more nice
tlun the first, upon which 1 brought away the carpenter's
stores, two or three bags full of nails, u great jack-screw
a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took
.away several things that belonged to the gunner particu-
larly two or three iron crows, two barrels of musket-bul-
lets, another fowling piece, a small quantity of powder,
and a large bagful of small shot. Besides these, I took
all the men's clothes I could find, a spare top-sail, a ham-
mock, and some bedding; and thus completing my se-
«o;id cargo. I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing
some wild beast might destroy what I had there already.
But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the
chests, which seeming not to fear me or the gun that I
presented at her, 1 threw her a piece of biscuit, which
she instat'tly ate and departed.
When I had gotten these effects on shore, I went to
work in order to make me a little tent with the sail and
some poles which I had cut for that purpose; and having
finished it, what things might be damaged by the weather
I brought in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a
oircle, the better to fortify it against any sudden attempt
of man or beast. After this 1 blocked up the doors with
tome boards, and an empty chest, turned the long way
cut. I then charged my gun and pistol, and laying my
bed on the ground, slept as .comfortably till next morn-
ing, as though I had been in a Christian country.
Now though I had enough to subsist me a long time,
yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both ammu-
ui: i(»i and provision might be spent before such thing hap-
pened. I coveted as much as I could; and so long as the
ship remained in that condition, I daily brought away one
necessary or other; particularly the rigging sails, and cor-
dage, some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a
barrel of meal, three casks of rum, and what indeed was
most welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
The next time 1 went I cut the cables in pieces, carried
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and
made another raft with the mizen and sprit sail-yard; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden I had up-
on it, and not being able so dextrously to guide it, as the
fijymer, both my cargo and I were overturned. For my
part, all the damage I sustained was a wet skin; and at
low water, after much labour in diving, I got the most of'
the cables, and some pieces of iron.
Thirteen days I had now been in the island, and eleven
times on board, bringing away all that was possible : and
I believe,had the weatherbeen culm,I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece. As I was going the,
twelfth time, the wind began to rise ; however, I ventured,
at lowwater, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found
several razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives and
forks ; and in another, thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight,
silver and gold. "Ah! simple vanity," said I, " whom
"this world so much dotes on, where is now thy virtue,
"thy excellency to me ? You cannot procure me one thing
"needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a
"place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteem-
"ed, is to me more preferable than all this heap E'en
"therefore remain where thou art, to sink in the deep as
'f unregarded, even, as a creature whose life is not worth
"preserving." Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it
up in a piece of canvass, and began to think of making an-
other raft; but I soon perceived the wind began to rise,
afresh gale'blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast
with clouds and darkness; so thinking a raft to be in vain,
I let myself into the water with what things I had about
me, and it was with much difficulty I got ashore, when
soon after it blew a fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent sur-
rounded with all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning no more ship was to be seen. This much sur-
prised me for the present; yet when I considered 1 had
lost no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing
useful out of her, 1 comforted myselt in the best manner,
and entirely submitted'!* the will of Providence
i My next thoughts were,how I should defend and'secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any suoh were in
ihe island. At one time I thought of digging a cave, at
another I was for erecting a teiit, and ut length, I resolv-
ed t0 do both : the manner or form of which will not, I
hope be unpleasing to describe.
When I considered the ground where I was, that it was
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, my resolutions
wcrir to search for a soil healthy and well watered, whf.re I
aught not omy be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat,
C
but be more conveniently situated, as well as to be secured
from wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to dis»
cover any distant sail, should it ever so happen.
And indeed, it was not long before I had my desire. I
found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards
•which being as steep as a house side,nothingcould descend
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolv-
ed my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de-
lightful green before my door, with a pleasing, though an
irregular descent every way to thelow grounds by the sea-
side, lying on the N.W. side of the hill, so that it was shel-
tered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this I
drew a semi-circle, containing ten yards in a semi-diame-
ter, and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows
of strong stakes, not six inches from each other. Then
•with the pieces of cable which I had cut on board, I re-
gularly laid them in a circle between the piles up to their
tops, which were more than five feet out of the earth, and
after droveanother row of piles looking within side against
them, between two or three feet high, which made me
conclude it a little impregnable castle against men and
beasts. And for my better security I would have no
door, but entered in and came out by the help of a ladder,
which I also made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried
all my riches, ammunition, and stores. After which, work-
ing on the rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out, I not
only raised my ground two feet, hut made a little cellar to
my mansion-house, and this cost me many days labour and
pams. One day in particular a shower of rain falling,
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest
my powder should take fire,and not only hinder my neces-
sary subsistence, by killing my food, but even blow up me
and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell to making
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near
1501b weight And thus being established as king ot the
island,every day I went out with my gun to see whatlcould
kill that was fit to eat. 1 soon perceived numbers of goats,
but very shy,yet having watched them narrowly,andseeing
I could bt-tier shoot off the rocks than when in the low
grounds, 1 happened to shoot a she-goat suckling a young
kid; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by her un-
eoncerned ;. and when I took the dead creature up, the
young one followed me even to the enclosure. I lifted
the kid over the pales, and would willingly have kept
alive; but finding it could not be brought to eat, I was
forced to slay it also for my subsistence.
Thus entered into as strange a scene oflife as ever any
man was in, I had most melancholy upprehensions con-
cerning mydeplorablecondition: and many times the tears
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered
how I was debarred from all communication with human
kind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem
to make me accuse Providence,other good thoughts would
interpose and reprove me after this manner: Well, sup-
posing you are desolate,is it not better to be so than totally
perish? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the
rest destroyed? Why should you complain, when not on-
ly your life is preserved, but the ship driven even into your
reach, in order to take what was necessary out of her for
your subsistence? But to proceed. It was, by the account
I kept, the 30th of September, when I first landed on this
island. About twelve days after, fearing lest I should lose
my reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days,
for want of pen, ink and paper, I carved with a knife up-
on a large post, in great letters, and set it up in the simili-
tude of a cross, on the sea shore where I landed, / came on
shore September 30, 1659. Every day I cut a notch with
my knife on the sides of this square post, and that on the
Sabbath was a* long again as the rest, and every first day
of the month as long again as that long one. In this
manner I kept my calendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly
reckoning of time. But had I made a more strict search (as
afterwards I did) I needed not have set up this mark ; 'or
among the parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter,and
captain's mate,I found those very things I wanted; particu-
larly pens, ink and paper; I also found two or three com-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspective
glasses, books of navigation, three English liiblcs, and se-
yeral other good books, which I carefully put up. Here
I cannot but call to mind our having a dog and two cats on
board, whom I made inhabitants with me in my castle.
Though one might think I had all the necessaries that
were desirable, yet still I found several things wanting.
My ink was daily wasting; I wanted needles, pins, and
thread to mend or keep my clothes together ; and parti-
cularly a spade, pickaxe, or shovel, to remove the earth.
It was a year before I finished my little bulwark:, and
having some intervals of relaxation, after my daily wan-
dering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan, alter-
nately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me of the mise-
ries and blessings of my life, under so many various cir-
cumstances.

And now easing my mind a little by these rcflections,-

of it,I thatched it so close,as might keep it from the inclem-
ency of the weather ; I also improved^! within, enlarged
my cave, and made a passage and doorln the rock, which
name out beyond the pale of my fortiflcjition. I next pro-
ceeded to make a chair and a table, and so began to study
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practicable. When
I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with my
hatchet, making it as thin with my axe as possible, and
then smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs:
yet though I could make no more this way than one board
out of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to
shelter all my stores, every thing being regularly placed,
and my guns securely hanging against the side of the rock.
This made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the re-
sult of vast labour and diligence ; which leaving for a
while, and me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the read-
er an account of my Journal from the day of my landing,
till the fixing and settling of my habitation, as heretofore
shown.
JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659,1, unhappy Robinson Cru-
soe, having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this deso*
late Island, which 1 named the Desolate Island of despair,
my companions being swallowed up in the tempestuous
ocean. The next day I spent in consideration of my un-
happy circumstances, having no prospect but of death,
ehher to be starved with hunger, or devoured with beasts
or merciless savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I beheld the
ship drove ashore Some hopes I had, that when the storm
was abated, I might be able to get some food and necessa-
ries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be- . .
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time I lamented
the loss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving
the vessel. When I perceived the ship as it were lie dry, •'
I waded through the sands, then swam on board, the
weatiier being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.
To the 14th of this month, my time was employed-jn
making voyages, every tide getting' what 1 could out of
the ship. The weather very wet and uncertain.
Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods thereon were overset;
yet I recovered mosr again at low water.
Oct. 25. It blew nard, and rained night and day, when
the ship went in pieces ;so that nothing was seen of
'• C 3

but the wreck at low water This day I secured my goods.
from the inclemency of the weather.
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I could find a place
convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the even-
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up
my lodgings very contentedly in a hammock that night.
Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with limber, chests,
#nd boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowls, resembling ducks, which
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.
Nov. 4.1 began to live regularly. In Hie morning I al-
lowed myself two or three hours to walk out with my gun;
I then worked till near eleven o'clock, and afterwards re-
freshed myself with what I had to eat. From twelve to
two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry wea*
'.her. In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild
cat with a soft skin, but her flesh was gooflfor nothing.
The skins of those 1 killed, I preserved. In my return,-
1 perceived many wild birds, and was terrified by some
seals which made off to se«
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but omit-
ed the 11th, which, according to my calculation 1 suppos-
ed to be Sunday.
Nov. 3. Rain in abundance, which however, much
cooled the air ; with thunder and lightning, caused in me
a terrible surprise. The weather clearing, I secured my
powder in separate parcels.
. Nov. 14—16. I made little boxes for my powder, lodg-
irfg' them in several places. I also shot a large fowl which •
proved excellent meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged
to desist for want of pick-ax, shovel, and wheel-barrow.
Iron craws I caused to supply the place of the first; but
•with all my art I couWr not make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling
what Brazilians call an iron tree. I had like to have spoil-
ed my ax with cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly
heavy; yet wiih much labour and industry, I niade a
sort of a spade-.out of it. *
Nov. 25. These tools being made, I daily carried on my
business; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave,
that it might not only serve me for a warehouse, but
kitchen, parlour, and cellar, I commonly lay in the tent,
unless the weather was rainy that I could not lie dry. So
wet would it be at certain seasons, that 1 was obliged to
cover all within the pale with long poles in the form of
rafters, leaning against the rock, and loaded them with
flags and large leaves, of trees, resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I thmk my habitation fmished,
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that it
•was a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. This occasion-
ed a great deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could
make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove nails and
staples in the wall and posts to hang things out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then made a
sort of a dresser, and another table.
Dec 24—25. Rain in abundance.
Dec. 26 Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats, shot one,
and wounded another, I led it home in a string, bound up
its leg, and.cured it in a little time; at length it became
so tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and follow•
me where I pleased. This put n;e in mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food alter niy
ammunition was spent.
Dec. 28-29-30 The weather being excessively hot,
•with little air, obliged me for the most part, to keep with-
in doors:
Jan. 1. Still sultry,howcver obliged by necessity,I went
.out with my gun, and found a great store of goats in the
valleys; they were exceedingly shy, nor could my dog
hunt them down.
Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finish
the wall before described, and search the island. I discov-
ered a kind ot pigeons like our house-pigeons in a nest a-
mong the rocks. 1 brought them home, nursed them till
they could fly, and then they left me. After this, I shot
some, which proved excellent food. Some time 1 spent
vainly in contriving to make a cask; I may well say it was
vain, because I could neither joint the staves, nor fix the
Ireadu, so as to make it tight: So leaving that, took some
goat's tajlow I' had about me, and a little oakum for the
I

wick, and provided myself with a lamp, which served me
instead of candles.
But now a very strange event happened. For being in
the height of my search, what should come into my hand,
but a bag, which was used to hold corn (as I supposed) for
the fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in
it, I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock,
little expecting what the consequence would be. The rain
• had fallen plentifully a few days befo»e; and about a month
after, to my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when I came to view
it more nicely, every day as it grew, I found about ten or
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same
shape and make as that in England.
I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this
sight. Hitherto, I had looked upon the actions of this life
no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and
fortune. But now, the appearance of this barley, flourish-
ing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving
how it should come there, made me conclude, that miracles
were not yet ceased: nay, I even thought that god had ap-
pointed it to grow there without any seed, purely for my
sustenance in this miserable and desolate island. And in-
deed such great effect this had upon me, that it often made
me melt into tears, through a grateful sense of God's mer-
cies; and the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of barley some rice stalks,
also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
more corn in this island; and therefore made a diligent
search narrowly among the rocks ; but not being able to
find any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how 1 had
shaken the husks of corn out of the bag, and then my ad-
r«» miration ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being,
''.'\ as (/linking it was but natural, and not to be conceived a
miracle; though even the manner of its preservation
might have made me own it as a wonderful event of
God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the ears of this
corn ripened, which 1 laid u[> very carefully together with
20 or 30 stalks of rice,expeeting one day I should reap the
fruit of my labour; yet four years were expired before I
could ailow myself t0 eat any hurley bread, and much lon-
ger time before I had any rice. After this, with indeiatiga-
\
ble pains and industry, for three or four months, at last I
finished my wall on the 14th of April,,having no way t»
go into H> but by a ladder against the wall.
April 16. I finished my ladder, anu ascended it; after-
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and
descended into my new habitation, where I had space
enough, and so fortified that nothing could attack me,
without scaling the walls.
But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the
blessing of God does not crown our labours ? Or who can
stand before the almighty, when he stretcheth forth his
arm ? For one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake, that not only
the roof of the cave came rumbling about my ears, but the
posts seemed to crack terribly at the same time. This
put me in great amazement; and running lo the ladder,
and gettmg over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an
earthquake, the place I stood on sustaining three terrible
shocks in less than three minutes. ' But judge of my ter-
ror when I saw the top of a great rock roll into the sea;
I then expected the island would be swallowed up every
moment : and what made the scene still more dreadful,
was to see the sea thrown into the most violent agitations
and disorders by this tremendous accident.
For my part I stood like a criminal at the place of exe-
cution ready to expire. At the moving of the earth, I
was as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid lest the
rock, under which was my fence and habitation, should
overwhelm it and myself in a lasting tomb.
When the third dreadful shock had spent itself, my spi-
rits began to revive ; yet still I would not venture to as-
cend the ladder, but continued sitting, not knowing what
I should do. So little grace had I then, as only to sa.
Lbrd ha-ve mercy v/ion me ! and no sooner was the earth
quake over, but that pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose,
at the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. The
sea seemed mountains high, and the waves rolled so im-
petuously, that nothing could be perceived but froth and
foam. Three hours did this storm continue, and in so vi-
olent a manner, as to tear the very trees up by the roots,
which was succeeded by abundance of rain. When the
tempest was over I went to my tent: but the rain coming
on in a furious manner, I was obliged to take shelter if,

the cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through my
fortification to let the water out. It continued raining all
that night, and some time the next day. These accidents
made me resolve, as soon as the weather cleared up, to
build me a little hut in some open place, walled round to
defend me from wild creatures and savages ; not doubt-
ing but at the next earthquake, the mountain would fall
upon my habitation and me, and swallow up all in its bow-
els
April 16—20. These days I spent in contriving how
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All
this while I was under the most dreadful apprehensions.
When I looked round my habitation, every thing I found
in its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I
should move or not; but at length resolved to stay where
I was, till I found out a convenient place where I might
pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolutions in prac-
tice, I was stopped for want of tools and instruments to
work with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless,
occasioned by cutting-the hard timber that grew on the
island. -It took me up a full week to make my grind-stone
of use to me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about
with my foot, by help of a wheel and a string.
April 28,29. These days were spent in grinding my
tools.
April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but-
one biscuit a day
May 1. As I walked along the sea shore, I found a bar-
rel of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea
had flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship,
whose stern was torn off, and washed a great distance
'ashore; but the rest lay in the sand. This I suppose was
occasioned by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my
old place of abode ; and also to go to the ship that day,
but then found it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw
sawed oft' one of the beams, which kept her quarter-deck.
I then cleared the sand till flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they were not whole-
some. The same day I also catched a young dolphin.
May 5. This day I also repaired to the wreck, and saw-
ed another piece of timber, and when the flood came, I
made a float of three great planks, which were driven
dshore by the tide., "' %

May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought off the iron bolts,
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks
to land, having made way into the very middle of the
wreck.
May 10,11, 12. 13, 14. All this time I spent in bringing
eff great quantities of iron and limber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut
off some lead from the roll, but all in vain, for it lay too
low under water.
May 16.1 omitted going to the wreck this day, for em-
ploying myself inlooking for pigeons, 1 out-staid my time.
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven
ashore, which I found belonged to the head of the ship.
May 24 To this day 1 worked on the wreck, and with,
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the
crow, that at the first flowing tide several casks floated out,
and many of the seamen's chests, yet that day nothing came
to land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had
some Brazil pork in it. I continued working up to the 15th
of June; (except necessary limes for food and rest) and
had I known how to have built a boat, I had timber and
planks enough : I had also near 100 weight of sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the seaside, I
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen
wi the island, though, as I afterwards found, there were
many on the other side of it.
June 17 This day I spent in cooking it, found in hef
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savoury and pleas*
ant I ever tasted in my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continual
rain ; and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than
usual.
Jijne 19 Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling
and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked with pain
and feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre-
quently but very confusedly.
June 22. Something better but still uneasy in my mind.
Jun"' 23- Again relapsed much as before.
June 24. Mended a second time.
June 25 A violent ague for seven hours, cold and hot
fits succeeded with faint sweats.
June 27. Better, but very weak, yet I scrambled out,
shot a she-goat, brought it home and broiled some of it;
I' would willingly have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot. .
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague; thirs-
ty, yet could not help myself to water : Prayed to God,
in these words : "Lord : in pity look upon me : Lord have
"mercy upon me: have mercy upon me !" After this-1
fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me when I
awaked. I fell fast asleep) a second time, and fell into tHis
strange and terrible sort of dream.
Methought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at
the outside of the wall where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake ; and that I saw a man descending
from a great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He
•was all over as bright as a flash of fire that a little before
surrounded him ;his countenance inconceiveably terrible;
the earth as it were trembled when he stept upon the
ground, and flashes of fire seemed to fill all the air. No
sooner I thought him landed upon the earth but with a
long spear, or other weapon, he made towards me; but
urst ascended a rising ground, his voice added to my
amasement, when I thought I heard him pronounce these
dreadful words, "Unhappy wretch! seeing all these
"things have not brought thee to a repentance, thou shalt
"immediately die." In pronouncing this dreadful sen-
tence, I thought he went to kill me with a spear that was
in his hand.
Any body may think it imposible for me to express the
horrors of my mind at this vision : and even when 1 awak-
ed, this very dream made a deep impression upon my
mind. The little divine knowledge I had, 1 received from
my father' s instructions, andofhat was worn out by an un-
interrupted series of sea faring impiety for eight years
space Except what sickness forced from me, I do not
remember I had one thought of lifting up my heart to-
wards God, but lather had a certain stupidity of soul, not
having the least sense or fear of the Omnipotent Being
when in distress, nor of gratitude to him for his deliver-
ances May, when I was on the ^desperate expedition on
the desert African shore. I c^iuiot remembr.r 1 had one
thought of what would .oetomc of me, or to be< i>is con-
solation and dsststince in my suffermgs and distress. Wlien
the Portugal captain took cne up, und honourably.used me,
nay, further, when I was even delivered from drowning by
escaping to this island, I never looked upon it as a judg-
ment, but only said I was an unfortunate dog, and that's
all. Indeed some secret transports of soul I had, which
was not through grace, but only a common flight of joy,
that I was yet alive, when vny companions were all drown-
ed, and no other joy could 1 conceive but what is common
with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they had es-
eaped the greatest dangers.
'The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni-
ences, might have called upon me fora thankful acknow*'
ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth of my corn
touched me with some sense ; but that soon wore offagain.
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as y. were, the fin-
ger of Sod, but my dreadful amazement continued no lon-
ger than its duration. But now, when my spirits began
to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and I
could leisurely view the miseries of death present them-
selves before my eyes, then my awakened conscience be-
gan to reproach me with my past life, in which I had so
wickedly provoked the justice of God to pour down his
vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as these oppressed me even in the vio-
lence of distemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only
proceeded from the fear of death. But when I considered
my father's advice and prophecy,I could not forbear weep-
ing ; for he told me, "That if I did persist in my folly, I
"should not only be deprived of God's blessing, but have
"time enough to reflect upon my despibing his instruc-
"tions, and this, in a wretched time, when none could
"help me." And now concluding it to be fulfilled, having
no soul in the island to administer any comfort to me, I
prayed earnestly to the Lord, that he would help me in
this my great calamity. And this I think, was the first
time I prayed in sincerity for many years. But now I
must return to my journal.
June 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit
quitv off. I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a
great consternation; and fearingthat the ague might return
the succeeding <hy, I concluded it time to get someihing
to comfort me. 1 filled a- case bottle with water, and set it
within reach of my bed; and to make it more nourishing
and less chilly, I put some rum in it- The next thing I did
was to broil me a piece of goat's flesh) of irhich I ate but
little. I was very weak; however walked about, dreading
the return of my distemper; and at night I supped on
three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate,lbeg-
ging God's blessing therewith.
After 1 had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of
doors with my gun ; but was so weak, that I sat down, and
looked at the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I
continued here, these thoughts came into my mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and sea,of
v/hich I have seen so much? From whence came myself,
and all other creatures living, and of what are they made*
Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty
invisible Power, who framed the earth, and sea, and air,
and all therein. But what is that power?
Certainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet,
said I,if God has made all this he must be the ruler of thsm
'all, and what is relating thereto; for certainly the Power
that makes, must indisputably have a power to guide and
direct them. And if this be so (as certainly it must)nothing
can happen without his knowledge and appointment. Then
surely, if nothing happens withoutGod's appointment, cer-
tainly God has appointed these my sufferings to befal me.
And here I fixed my firm belief that it was his will that
it should be so ; and then proceeded to inquire, why should
<Jod deal with me in this manner? or what have I done
ihus to deserve his indignation?
Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a
blasphemer ; crying with aloud and piercmg voice, "Un-
"worthy wretch ! how dare you ask what you have done I
<•'• Look on your, past life, and see what you have left un»
*"• done? Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the
"merciless hands of death? Why not drowned in Yar-
"mouth roads, or killed in the fight, when the ship was
"taken by the Sallee man of war? Why not entombed in
"the bow-els of wild beasts on the African coast, or
''• drowned here when all thy companions suffered ship
•" wreck in the ocean?"
Struck dumbwith these reflections,Ijrose up in a pensive
manner, being so thoughtful that I eould not go to sleep;
and fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it caus-
ed me to remember, that the Brazilians use tobacco for al-
most all diseases. I then went to my chest in order to find
some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a cure
for both soul and body j for there I found one of. the Bibles^
Wnlch, till this time, I had neither leisure nor inclination
to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out of the
ehest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece of leaf,
and chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost
stiipified me. Next I steeped it in some rum an hour or
two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose of it: and
in the third place, I burnt some over a pan of fire, holding-
my nose over it as long as I could endure it without
suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head wag
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to
read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to me
these words, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
"deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
At first this sentence made a very deep impression on
my heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered-
the word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children
of Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, " Gail
"God spread a table in the wilderness ?" In like manner I
began to say, " Can God himself deliver me from this de-
"solate island ?" However, the words would still return to
my mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon
me.
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to sleep ; but before I would lie down
I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God
had made to me in the Holy Scriptures, that " if I called.
f' upon him in the day of trouble he would deliver me."
With much difficulty I afterwards drank the rum,where-
in I had steeped the tobacco, which flying into my head,
threw me into such a profound sleep, that it was three
o'clock the next day before I awaked ; or rather, I believe,
I slept two days, having certainly lost a day in my account,
and I could never tell any other way. When I got up,
my spirits were lively and cheerful ; my stomach ranch
better, being very hungry; and, in short, no fit returned
the next day, which, was the 29th, but found myself much
altered for the better.
The 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and
killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a brand goose, which,
however, I cared not to eat when I,brought them home,
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the even-
ing I renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take
so large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke : but the next day, which was the
1st of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again
look my medicine as I did the first time.
July 3- The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this con-
dition, I often thought of these words, "I will deliver
"thee ; " and while, at some times, I would think of the
impossibility of it, other thoughts would reprehend me for
disregarding the deliverances I had received, even from
the most forlorn and distressed condition. I asked my-
self, what regard have I had to God for his abundant mer-
cies? Have I done my part ?" He has delivered me, but
tl I have not glorified him :"—as if I had said, I had not
tiwned and been thankful for these as deliverances, and
how could I expect greater? So much did this sensibly
'.ouch my heart, that I gave God thanks for my recovery
from sickness in the most humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on
what is written in the New Testament, resolving to read
a chapter every morning and night as long as my thoughts
would engage me. As soon as 1 set about this work seri-
ously, I found my heart deeply affected with the impiety
of my past life; these words that I thought were spoken
to me in my dream revived, " All these things have not
"brought thee to repentance." After this, I begged of
God to assist me with his Holy Spirit in returning to my
rluty. One day in perusing the Scriptures, I came to these
words, " He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give re-
"peniance and to give remission :" Immediately I laid
down the book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly
cried, "O blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou
"exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance !" And
now indeed I prayed with a true sense of my condition,
and a more certain hope, founded on the word of God.
No^v I had a different sense of these words, " Call on me
"and I will deliver thee," that is from the dreadful load of
guilt which oppressed my sinful soul, and not from a soli-
iary life, which might rather be called a blessing, seeing I
wanted neither food nor raiment, when compared with
living among the human race, surrounded with so much
oppression, misery, and affliction : in a word, I came to
this conclusion, that a deliverance from sin was a much
greater blessing, than a deliverance from affliction. But
again I proceed to my journal.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun, little
and a little at a time; having been reduced to the greatest
extremity of weakness. The applications and experiments
I used were perfectly new : neither could I recommend
them to anyone's practice. For thoughit carried off the fit,
it very much weakened me, and I had frequently convul-
sions in my nerves and limbs for some time. From this
I learned, that going abroad in rainy weather, especially
when it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind,
was most pernicious to health. I had now been about ten
months in the island; and as I never had seen any of the
human kind, I therefore accounted myself sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my
mind, I resolved to make'a tour round my kingdom, in or-
der to make new discoveries.
The 15th of July, I began my journey; I first went to
the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore; and
travelling further, found the tide went no higher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of
which I did not understand. I searched a long time fop
the Cassava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate
made their bread of, but all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes ; though at that time I knew not what they
were; likewise I saw several sugar canes, but imperfect
for want of cultivation. With these few discoveries, I
came back that night, and slept contentedly in my little
castle.
The next jlay, being the 16th, going the same way, but-
further than the day before, I found the country more
adorned with woods and trees. Here 1 perceived different
fruits in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe -and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine 1 was glad of this dis-
covery, but ate very sparingly, lest 1 should throw myself
into a flux or fever. The grapes 1 found of excellent use,
for when 1 had dried them in the sun, which preserved
them as dried raisins are kept, they proved very whole-
some and nourishing, and served me in those scusunr--
when »o grapes were to be h<td.

D2
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had
lain out my habitation And when the morning came, I
proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling about
lour miles, as 1 imagined, by the length of the valley, di-
recting my course northward, there being a ridge of hills
on the south and north side of me. At the end of this val-
ley, I came to an opening, where the country seeroed to de-
scend to the west ; there I found a little spring of fresh
water, proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its crys-
tal streams running directly east. And indeed, here my
senses were charmed with the most beautiful landscape na-
ture could afford ; for the country appeared flourishing,
green, and delightful, that to me it seemed like a planted
garden. I then descended on the side of that delicious
vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and
ipitron trees, but very wild and barren at that time.
As for the limes, they were delightful and wholesome,
Jthe juice of which I after used to mix in water, which made
it very cooling and refreshing. And now I was resolved
to carry home and lay up a store of grapes, limes, and lem-
ons, against the approaehing wet season. So laying them
up in separate parcels, and then taking a few of each with
me, I returned to my little castle, after having spent three
days in this journey. Before I got home, the grapes were
so bruised that they were utterly spoiled ; the limes in-
deed were good, but of those I could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither
again, but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread
about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten' which made
me conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To pre-
vent this happening again, I gathered a large quantity of
the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches of the
tree, both to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure
and dry in the sun ; and having well loaded myself with
limes and lemons, I returned once more to my old place qf
residence.
And now contemplating on the fruhfulness of this val-
ley, and pleasantness of its situation, Us security from
storms,autf the delightfulnessof the adjacent woods, I con-
cluded I was settled in the worst part of the country, and
therefore was thinking to remove my habitation.
But when I considered again, that though it was plea-
sant, it was far efl'from the aea-side where there was ? J)9S-
sibility, some time or other, a ship might either be driven
or sail ty; and that to inclose myself among hills and
woods must certainly put an end to my hopes of deliver-
ance; I resolved to let my castle remain where Provi-
dence had first assigned it. Yet so ravished was 1 with
this place, that I made me a liule kmd of bower, surround,
ing it with a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well
staked and filled with bullrushes : and having spent a great
part of the month of July, I think it Was the first of August
before I began to en;oy my labour
Aug. 3 Perceivmg my grapes to be dry, I took them
from the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of
the sun : the most of which I carried to my cave ; and
happy for me I did so ; by which I saved the best part of
my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain ; and though I had
made me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter of a
hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to re-
treat to, I was obliged to return to my old castle. The
rain continued more or less every day, till the middle of
October ; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir
out of my cave for several days. This season I found my
family to encrease ; for one of my cats that ran away from
me, and which I thought had been dead, returned about
August, with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which
I thought strange, because both my cats were females,
and the wild cats of the island seemed to be of a different
kind from our European cats; but from these cats pro-
seeded such numbers, that I was forced to kill and destroy
them as I would do wild beasts and vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir out, it rain-
ing incessantly ; when beginning to want food, 1 was com-
pelled to venture twice the first of which I shot a goat,
and afterwards found a very large tortoise. The manner
of my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of rai-
sins served me for my bieakfast, a piece of goats flesh
or turtle boiled for my dinner, and two or three turtle's
eggs for my supper. W hile the rain lasted, I worked dai-
ly two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by de-
grees worked it on towards one side, till I came to the
outside of the hill, and made a d*or or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall, and so I came in and out
this way. But after 1 had done this, I was troubled to see
myself thus exposed; though I covild not perceive
thing to fear, a goat being the biggest creature I had seen
upon this island.
Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which
amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the anniversary
of my landing ;and therefore humbly prostrating myself
on the ground, confessing my sins acknowledging God's
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus
Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours
till the going down of the sun ; and then eating a biscuit
and a bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great
comfort took my night's repose. Till this time I never,
had distinguished the Sabbath-day ; but now I made a-
longer notch than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided
the weeks as well as I could, though I found I had lost
a day or two in my account. My ink failmg soon after
I omitted in my daily memorandum things of an indiffer-
ent nature, and contented myself to write down only the
most remarkable events of my life. The rainy and dry
seasons appeared now regular to me, and experience
taught me how to provide for them; yet in one thing I
am going to relate, my experience very much failed -iie.
You may call to mind what I have mentioned of some bar-
ley and rice which I had saved ; about thirty stalks of the
former and twenty of the latter ; and at that time, the sun
being in its southern position, going from me, together
•with the rains, made me conclude it a very proper season
tosowit. AccordinglyI dugupapieeeofground with my
wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, sowed about
two thirds of my seed, preserving by me about a handful
«f each, and happy it was I did so ; for no rains falling,
it was choaked up, and never appeared above the earth till
the wet season came again, and then part oi it grew as if
it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and seeking
fbr a moister piece of ground near my bower, i;there sow-
ed the rest of my seed in February a little before the ver-
nal equinox; which having the rainy momhs of March
and April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up•
very pleasantly. I hud stili saved part of the seed, not
daring to venture all; and by the time I found out the
proper seasons to sow it in, und that 1 n ight expect every
year two seed limes and two harvests, my
to aboye half a peck of each sort of grajn.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which I
bad cut from the trees, shot out like willows the first year
after lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree 1 cut
them from : but they grew so regularly beautiful, that
they made a most lively appearance, and so flourished in
three years time, that I resolved to cut more of them;
and these soon growing made a glorious fence, as after-
wards shall be observed.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into wet and dry seasons, as in this manner :,

The wet season would continue longer or shorter, as
the winds happened to blow. But having found the ill
consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care be-
forehand to furnish myself with provisions; and during
the wet months sat within doors as much as possible. At
this time I contrived to make many things that I panted,
though it cost me much labour and pains, before I could
accomplish them. The first 1 tried was to make a bas-
ket; but all the twigs I could get proved so brittle, that I
could not then perform it.
It now proved of great advantage to me that when a
boy, I took a great delight in standing at a basket-maker's
in the same town where my father lived, to view them at
work ; and, like other boys, curious to see the manner of
their working these things, and very officious to assist, I
perfectly learned the method of it, and wanted nothing &u?
the tools. And it coming into my mind, that the twigs of
that tree of which I made my stakes, might be as tough
as a sallow willow, or osiers, growing in England, I re-
solved to make an experiment, and went the next day to
iny country-seat, and found some fit for my turn ; and af-
ter cutting down a quantity with my hatchet, I dried them
in my pale, and, when fit to work with, carried them to
my cave, where I employed myself in making several
Sorts of baskets, insomuch that I could put in whatsoever
I pleased. It is true, they were not cleverly made, yet
they served my turn upon all occasions.
But still I wanted two necessary things. I had no cask
to hold my liquor, except two rundlets almost full of rum>
a few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square case bot-
tles, neither had I a pot to boil any thing in only a large
kettle unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I want-
ed likewise at the beginning of this dry season a tobacco
pipe, but for this I afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my second row of
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the
brook, I had a mind to see the whole island, I now resum-
ed my intention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two
biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with alargerquan-
tity of powder and shot than usual, I began my journey.
Having passed the vale where my bower stood, I came
within view of the sea lying to the west; when it being a
dear day, I fairly descried land, extending from the West
to the S. W. about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded;
but could not say whether it was an island or a continent.
Neither could I tell what this place might be ; only
thought it was part of America, and where I might have
been in a miserable condition, had I landed. Again I con-
sidered that if this was the Spanish coast, certainly, one
time or other, I should see some ship pass by: and if it
was not, then it naust be the savage coast, between the
Spanish country and Brazil which abounds with cannibals
or man-eaters.
As I proceeded forward I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine, the fields fragrant, adorn-
ed with sweet flowers and verdant grass, together with
•several very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty,
which made me long for one to be my companion ; but
ft was with great difficulty I could knock one down with
Tay stick; and I kept him at home some years before I
could get him to call me by my name.
In the low grounds, J found various sorts of hares and
foxes, as I took them to be, but much different from those
inEngland Several of these I killed but never ate them;
neither indeed had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy Leadenhall
market to furnish me a better table. In this journey I did
not travel above two miles a-day because I took several
turns and windings, to see what discoveries I could make,
returning weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or in a place
which I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature
might suddenly surprise me. When I came to the-sea
shore, -I was amased to see the splendour of it. Its strand
was covered with shells of the most beautiful fish and con-
stantly abounding with innumerable turtles.and fowls of
many kinds, which I was ignorant of, except those called
penguins. I might have shot as many as I pleased, but
was sparing of my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a
she-goat, which I did with much difficulty, on account of
the flatness of the county.
Now though this journey produced me the most pleas-
ing satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking
that I did not repine at my being seated on the worst part
of the island. I continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the East, where I set a great
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next jour-
ney should bring me to the other side of the island, east
from my castle, and so runod till I came to my post again.
As I had a constant view of the country, I thought I could
not miss my way; but scarce had I travelled three miles,
when I decended into a very large valley so surrounded
with hills covered with wood, that having no guide but the
sun, nor even this, unless I knew well the position of it at
that time of the day ; and to add to ir.y misfortune, the
weather proving very hazy, I was obliged to return
tp my post by the sea side, and so backwards the
same way I came. In this journey my dog surprised
a kid, and would have killed it, had I not prevented him.
As I had often been thinking of getting a kid or two, and
so raismg a breed of tanie goats to supply me after my
ammunition was spent,I took this opportnity of begin-
J>I[rg : and having made a collar for this little creature^
with a string made of rope yarn, I brought it to my bow-
er, and there inclosed and left him ; and having spent a
month in this journey, at length I returned to my own
habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned
to my-litde castle, and reposed myself in my hammock.
Aftei my journey I rested myself a week, which time
I employed in making a cage for my pretty poll.
I now began to consider the poor kid I had left in the
bower, ano immediately went to fetch it home. When I
carafe there I found the young creature almost starved; I
gave, ii some food, and tied it as bef»re,but there was no oc-
casion, k>r it followed me like a dog ; and as I constantly
fed it, it became so loving, gentle and fond, that it com-
menced one of my domestics, and would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the 30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usuul, it being the third year of my abode in
the island I spent the whole duy in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks tor making this solitary life
as agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human society;
and for the communications of his grace to my soul, in sup-
porting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon
his Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in the
•world to come.
Indeed I often did consider how much more happy I was
in this state of life, thun in that accursed manner of living I
formerly used ; and sometimes when hunting, or viewing
the country, the anguish of my soul would break out upon
me, and my very heart would sink within me, to think of
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in ;and how
I was a prisoner locked up within the ettnial bars and
bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without
hopes and without redemption. In this condition I would
often wring my hands, and weep like a child: and even
sometimes, in the middle of my work this fit would take
me; and then I would sit down and sigh, lookmg on the
ground for an iiour or two together, till such time as my
griei got vent in a flood of tears.
One morning as I was sadly employed in this manner
I opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes up-
on these words," I will neverleavethee.nor forsake thce!"
Surely, thought I, these words are directed to me, or else
why• should they appear just at the moment wheu I am be-

moaning my forlorn condition ? and if God does not for-»
sake, what matters it, since he can make me more happy
in this state of life, than if I enjoyed the greatest splendour
in the world ? But while I was going to return God thanks
for my present state, something seemed to shock my mini
as if it had thus said: Unworthy wretch, can you pretend
to be thankful for a condition, from which you would pray
to be delivered ! here I stopt:—and tho' I could not say,
I thanked the Divine Majesty for being there, yet I gave
God thanks for placing to my view my former course o£
life, and granting me a true knowledge of repentance.
And whenever I opened or shut the Bible,! blessed kind
Providence, that directed my good friend in England to
send it among my goods without any order, and for assist-
ing me to save it from the power of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my several daily em-
ployments were these: First, my duty to Heaven, and di-
ligently reading the Holy Scriptures, which I did twice or
thrice every day ^Secondly, Seekingprovisionwith my gun,
which commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three
hours every morning,: Thirdly, the ordering, curing, pre-
serving and cooking what I had killed, or catched for my
supply, which took me up great part of the day : for in the
middle of the day, the sun being in its height, it was so
hot, that I could not stir out ; so that I had only but four
hours in the evening to work in, and then the want of tools,
of assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days making a
board fit for a long shelf, which two sawyers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the same tree in half
a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be broad.
I was three days in cutting it down, and two more in lop-
ping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of timber.
This I hacked and hewed off each side, till it became light
to move ; then turned it, made one side of it smooth and
flat as a board from end to end, then turned it downward
catting the other side, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any body
may judge my great labour and fatigue in such a piece
of work ; but this I went through with patience, as also
many other things that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do.
The harvest months, November and December, were
now at hand, in which I had the ple.asing prospect of a
.pood crop. But here I met with, a new misfortune ; for
the goats and hares, having tasted ot the sweetness of the
blade, kept it so short that it had not strength (p shoot up
into a stalk To prevent this, I enclosed it with a hedge,
and by day shot some of its devourers ; and my dog which
I had tied to the field gate, keeping barking all night so
frightened those creatures, that I got entirely rid of them.
But no sooner did I getrid of these, than other enemies
appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several sorts of birds, who
only waited till my back was turned to ruirt me. So much
did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the
malefactors ; and afterwards served them as they do noto-
rious thieves in England, hung them up in chains as a ter.
ror to othete. And indeed, so good an effect had this that
they not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the
island, so long as these criminals hung there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem-
ber whjch was my second harvest, I reaped it with a scythe^
made of one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue in cut-
ting down my first crop it was so slender. The ears I car-'
lied home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead
of thrashing it: and when the harvest was over, found
my half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice-,
and two bushels and a half of barley.
And now I plainly foresaw, that by God's goodness, I
should be furnished with bread; but yet was concerned,
because 1 knew not how to grind or make meal of my corn,
nor bread, neither knew how to bake it. I would not, how-
ever taste any of the crop, but resolved to preserve it
against next season, and in the meanwhile, use my best
endeavours to provide myself with other food.
But where were my labours to. end? the want of a
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquer-
od by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow
1 supplied myself, with dragging over the corn a great,
bough of a tree. When it was growing, I was forced to
ience it; when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrash it,
part it from the chaff, and'save it. And after all, I wanted
a. mill to grind it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to m'ike
it into bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my brams
to woi k to find some expedient for every one of these ne-
cessaries against the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare
roe more land, 1 pitched upon two large flat pieces of
ground near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sow-
ed my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took
me up three months ; by which time the wet season com-
ing on, and the rain keeping me within doors, I found se-
veral occasions to employ myself: and while at work,
used to divert myself in talking to my parrot, learning him
to know and speak his own name Pol/, the first welcome
word Fever heard spoke in the island. I had been a lo^ng
time contriving how to make earthen vessels, which I
wanted extremely : and when I considered the heat of the
climate, I did not doubt but if I should find any such clay
I might botch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the
sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that was dry,
as corn, meal and other things.
To be short, the clay I found ; but it would occasion tho
most serious person to smile, to see what awkward ways I
took, and what ugly misshappen things I made ; how many
either fell out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun,
and fell in pieces when they were removed ; so that I think
it was two months time before I could perfect any thing:
and even then but two clumsy things in imitation cf ear-
then jars. These however, 1 very gently placed in wicker'
baskets, made on purpose for them, and between the pot
and the baskets, stuffed it full of rice a^d barley straw, and
these I presumed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps
the meal when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller
things I made them with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers and pipkihs, the sun bak-
ingthem very hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely necessary, and,
that was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but
also to bear the fire, which none of these could do. It once
happened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein
abroken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard asa rock,
and red as a tile. This made me think of burning some
pots; and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them
with lead, I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots in a pile one upon another. The fire I piled round
the outside, and dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in
the inside red hot, and found that they were not cracked
at all : and when I perceived them'perfectly red, I let one
of them stand in the fire about five or six hours, till the
elay melted by thfi extremity of the heat, and would have
run to glass, had I suffered it; upon which I slacked my
.fire by degrees, till the redness abated; and watching
them till the morning, I found I had three very good pip-
kins, art! two earthen- pots, as well burnt and fit for my
torn as I could desire.
%No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery.
1'or after this, I may say, I wanted for no sort of earthen,
ware. I filled one of my pipkins with water to boil me
some meat, which it did admirably well, and with a piece
of kid I made me some good broth, as well as my circum-
stances would afford me at that time.
The next concern I had was to get me a stone-mortar
10 beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here
indeed I was at a great loss, as not being fit for a stone
ctuter and many days I spent to find out a great stone
big enough to bear the weight of a pestle, and that would
break the corn without filling it with sand. But all the
stones of the island being of a mouldering nature, render-
ed my search fruitless; and then I resolved to look out
for a great block of hard wood, which having- found, I
formed it with my ax and hammer, and then, with infin-
ite labour, made a hollow in it, just as the Indians of
Brazil make their canoes. When I had finished this, I
made a great pestle of iron wood, and then laid them up
against my succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make me a sieve, to sift my
meal, and part it from the bran and husk. Having no
iine thin canvass to search the meal through, I could not
tell what to do. What linen I had was reduced to rags:
I had goats' hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor
did I know how to spin it: At length I remembered I
liad some neckcloths of calico or muslin of the sailors,
which I had brought out of the ship, and with these I
made three small sieves proper enough for the work
I come now to consider the baking part. The want of
an oven I supplied by making some earthen pans very
broad but not deep. When I had a mind to bake, I made
a great fire upon the earth, the tiles of which I had made
myself: and when the wood was burnt into live coals, I
spred them over it, till it became very hot; then sweep-
ing them away, I set down my loaves, and whelming down
the earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and coals all
around the outsides of the pots to continue the heat: and
in this manner I baked my barley loaves, as well as if I
had been a complete pastry-cook, and also made of the
rice several cakes and puddings.
If is no wonder that these things took me up the best
part of the year, since what intermediate time I had was
bestowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry!
for in the proper season I reaped my corn, carried it home,
and laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, till 1 hatt
time to rub instead of thrashing it. And now, indeed, my
corn increased so much, that it produced me twenty bush-
els of barley, and as much rice, that 1 not only began to
use it freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns,
and resolved to sow as much at a time as would be suffi-
cient for me for a whole year.
All this while, the prospect ofland, which I had seen,
from the other side of the islands, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a deliverance from this place though the fear
of greater misfortunes might have deterred me from it.—
'For, allowing that I- had attained that place, I run the haz-
ard of being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals;
and if they were not so ; yet I might be slain, as other Eu-
ropeans had been, who' fell into their hands. Notwith-
standing all this, my thoughts ran continually upon that
shore. I now wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat
with the shoulder of mutton sail: I went to the ship's boat
that had been cast a great way on the shore in the late
storm. She was removed but a little ; but her bottoni be-
ing turned up by the impetuosity and fury of the waves
and wind, I fell to work with all the strength I had, with
lev«rs and rollers ] had cut from the wood, to turn her,
and repair the damages she had sustained. Th i work
look me up three or four weeks, when .finding my little
strength all in vain, I fell to undermining it by digging
away the sand, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it in the fall. 15ut after this
•was done, I was still unable to stir it up, or to get under
it, much less to move it forward towards the water, and-
so I was forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I.
began to think whether it was not possible for me to make'
a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk
of a tree. But here I lay under particular inconveniences;
want of tools to make it, and want of hands to move it in-
the water when it was made. However, to work I went
upon it, stopping all the inquiries I could make, with this-
very simple answer I made to myself, Let's first make jt»,
E 2
I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to get it along
when it is done.
I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and
four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two
feet,-after which it lessened for a space, and then parted
into branches. Twenty days was I a hacking and hewing
this tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the
branches and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like
fhe bottom of a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks
with a mallet and chissel, clearing it in such a manner, as
that it was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much
bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and conse-
quently sufficient to transport me and all my effects to that
•wished-for shore I so ardently desired.
Nothing remained now, but indeed, the greatest diffi-
culty, to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred
yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which
was a rising hill between the boat and the creek, with
wonderful pains and labour I dug into the bowels of the
oarth, and made a declivity. But when this was done, all
the strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it
was when I attempted to remove the boat. 1 then pro-
oeeded to measure the distance of ground, resolving to
make a canal, in order to bring the water to the canoife
since I could not bring the canoe to the water. But as this
seemed impracticable to myself alone, under the space
of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into some sort of
Consideration : so that I concluded this also to be impossi-
ble, and the attempt altogether vain. I now saw, and not
before, what stupidity it is to begin work before we reckon
its cost, or judge rightly our own abilities to go through
with its performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year expired,from
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not
forget my anniversary; but kept it with rather greater de-
•yotion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated,
I looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do
•with ; and very well might I say, as Father Abraham said
ymt'o Dives,'' Between thee and. me there is a gulph fixed.'
And indeed I was separated from its wickedness too, hav-
ing neither the lust of the ftesh, the lust of the eye, nor
the prideoflife ; I had nothing to covet, bemg lord, king,
and empeyor over the whole country I had in possession,
without dispute and without controul: I had loadings of
corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes
above measure. What was all the rest to me? the money
I had laid by me as despicable dross, which I would freely
have given for a groce of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill to
grind my corn: in a word, the nature and experience of
these things dictated to me this just reflection: That the
good things of this world are no farther good to us, than
they are for our use ; and that whatever we may heap up
to give to others, we can but enjoy as much as we use,
and no more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usu-
al. Every time I sat down to meat, I did it with thankful-
ness, admiring the Providential hand of God, who, in this
wilderness had spread a table to me. And now 1 consider-
ed what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted, compared
rny present condition with what I first expected it should
be; how shouldlhave done, HI had got nothing out of the
ship; that I must have perished before I had caught fish
or turtles ; or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage,
by eating them raw, and pulling them to pieces with my
claws, like a beast. I next compared my station to that
which I deserved; how undutiful I had been to my pa-
rents ; how destitute of the fear of God ; how void of every
tiling that was good; and how ungrateful for those abund-
ant mercies 1 had received from Heaven, being fed as it
were, by a miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed by
ravens; and cast on a place where there is no venomous
creatures to poison or devour me ; in short, making God's
tender mercies matter of great consolation, I relinquished
all sadness, and gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I made
last as long as possible, I used to minute down the days of
the month, on which any remarkable event happened.—
And,
First, I observed, that the same day I forsook my
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go
to sea, the same day afterwards in the next year, I was
taken and made a slave by Sallee rovers:
That the very day I escaped out of the wreck of the ship
in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the same day, I made
my escape from the Sallee in my patron's fishing boat;
And, on the 30th of September, being the day of the
year I was born on, oil that day twenty-six yeai s after,
yas I miraculously saved, amd cast ashore on this island.
The next thing thai wasted after my ink, was the biscuit
which I had brought out of the ship, and though I allowed
myself but one cake a-day, for above a twelve month, yet
I was quite but of bread lor near a year, before I got any
corn of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linen had been gone long before. However, I had preserv-
ed about three dozen of the sailors chequere'd shirts which
proved a great refreshment to me, when the violent beams
of the sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seamen's
heavy watch-coats ; which made me turn tailor, and after
a miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets.
To preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat skins,
with the hair outwards to keep out the rain ; which indeed
served me so well, that afterwards I made me a waist-
coat and, open kneed breeches of the same : and then I
contrived a sort of an umbrella, covering it with skins,
which not only kept out the heat of the sun, but rain also.
Thus being easy, and settled in my mind, my chief .hap-
piness was to converse with God, in most heavenly and
comfortable, ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure
my raisins, and plant my burley and rice, both of which I
had a years provision beforehand. But though 1 was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made' it at intermediate
times, my business to make a second, of much inferior
size ; and it was two years before I had finished it. But
•as I perceived it would no wise answer my design of sail-
ing to the other shore my thoughts were confined to take
a tour round the island to see what further discoveries I
could make. To this intent after havmg moved hef to
the water, and tried how she would sail, 1 fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail of the ship's sail that laid
by me. 1 then made lockers or boxes at the end of it, to
put in necessaries, provision and ammunition, which
would preserve them dry, either from rain or the spray oT
the sea; and in the inside of the boat, I Cut me a long hol-
low place to lay my gun in, and to keep it dry made a
flag to hang over it. My umbrella I fixed in a step in the
stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the sun offme.
Andnow resolving to see the circumference of my little ••••
kingdom, I victualled my ship for the voyage, puttmg in
two dozen of my barley bread loaves, an«arthen pot full of
-parched rice,and a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder
and shot, and two watch coats.
Itwas the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my reign,
or captivity, that I set out in this voyage, which was much
longer than 1 expected, being obliged to put farther out,
by reason of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea.
And indeed so much did these rocks surprise me, that I
was for putting back, fearing that if I ventured farther it
'would be out of my power to return. In this uncertainty
I came to an anchor just offshore, to which I waded with
my gun on my shoulder, and then climbing up a hill,
which over-looked that point, I saw the full extent of it,
and so resolved to run air hazards.
In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a violent cur-
rent running to the east, coming very close to the point;
which I the move carefully observed, thinking it danger-
ous, and that when I came to it. I might be drove into the
sea by its force, and not be able to return to the island ; and
certainly it must have been so, had I not made this obser-
vation ; for on the other side was the like current, with this
difference, that it set off at a greater distance ; and I per-
ceived there was a strong eddy under the land; so that
my chief business was to work out of the first current,
and conveniently get into the eddy. Two days I staid
here, the wind blowing very briskly E. S. E. which being
contrary to the current, leaves a great breach of the sea
upon the point; so it was neither fit for me to keep too
near the shore on account of the breach ; nor stand at too
great a distance, for fear of the streams. That night the
wind abating, it grew so calm, that I ventured out; and
here 1 may be a monument to all rash and ignorant pilots;
for I was no sooner come to the point, and not above the
boat's length from shore, but was got into a deep water,
•with a current like a mill, which drove my boat along so
violently, that it was impossible for me to keep near the
edge of it, but forced me more and more out from the
eddy to the left ot me ; and all I could do with my paddles
were useless, there being no wind to help me
Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost, since as
the current run on both sides of the island. I was very cer-
tain they must join again, and then I had no hopes but of
perishing for want in the sea, after what provision I had
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise.
%
Who can conceive the present anguish of my mind at
this calamity ? with longing eyes did I look upon my little
kingdom, and thought the island the pleasamest place in
•the universe. Happy, tfirice. happy desert, said I, shall I
never sec thee more? wretched creature ! whither am I;
going? why did I murmur at my lonesome condition,
when now I would give the whole world to he thither
again? while I was thus complaining. I found myself to
be driven about two leagues into the sea ; however, I la-
boured till my strength was far spent, to keep my boat as
for north as possibly I could, to that side of the current
where the eddy lay on.
About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind spring
up from the S. S. E.which overjoyed my heart; and was still
more elated, when, in about half an hour, it blew a gentle
fine gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, 1 had been
lost another way; for having no dompass on board, I should
never have found the way to steer towards the island, if
once it had disappeared; but it proving the contrary, I set
up my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away north-
ward, us much as I could, to get rid of the current. And no
sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceived',
by the clearness of the water, a change of the current was
near, for where it was strong, the water was foul; and
where it was clear, the current abated. To the east, I soon
saw, about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks
which caused it again to separate ; and as the main force
of it drove away more southwardly, leaving the rocks to
the north-east, so the other came back by the repulse of
the rocks making a sharp eddy, Which Returned back a-
gain to the north-west with a very swift stream.
They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved
upon the ladder,or t,o be saved from thieves, just going to
takeaway their lives,or such ashavebeeninthelike calami-
ties with my own, may guess my present excess of joy;
how heartily I ran my boat into the stream of this eddy,
and how joyfully I spread my sail to the refreshing wind,
standing cheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot.
By the assistance of this eddy, I was carried above a league
home again, when being in the wake of the island, betwixt
the two currents, I found the water to be in a s'ort of a stand
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a
league of the island, and perceived the poims of the rock,
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be-
fore to the southward,which throwing off the current more
southwardly had accasioned another eddy to the north.
But having a fair brisk gale, I stretched acioss this tddy,
and in an hour came within .a mile of the shore, where I
soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an hum-
ble postratU>n, thanking God for my deliverance, with a
resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought
my boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a
welcome repose. When I awoke, I was considering how
I might get my boat home ; and coasting slong the shore,
I came 10 a good bay which ran up to a rivulet or brook,
where finding a*afe harbour, I stowed her as safe as if she
had been in a dry dock made on purpose for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the place where
before I had travelled on foot; so taking; nothing with me,
except my gun and umbrella, I began my journey, and in
the evening came to my bower, vhere I againlaid'me down
to rest. J had not slept long before I .was awakened in
great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several
times," Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin ! Where
'' are you Robinson Crusoe? Where are you ? Where
"have you been I"
. So fast was I asleep at first, that I did not awake tho-
roughly; but half asleep and jialf awake, I thought I
dreampd that somebody spoke to me. But, as the voice re-
peated Robinson Crusoe several times, being terribly af-
frighted, I started up in the utmost confusion; and no
sooner were my eyes fully open, but 1 beheld my pretty
Poll sitting .on the top of the hedge, and soon knew that
it was him that called me; for just such bewailing lan-
guage I used to talk and teach him ; which he so exactly
learned, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill
close to my face, and cry,'' Poor Robinson Crusoe, where
"are you ? where have.you been? how came you here?"
and such like prattle I had constantly taught him.
But even though 1 knew it to be the Parrot,it was a great
while before I could adjust myself; being amazed how the
creature got thither, and that he should fix about that place
and no where else. But now being assured it could be no
other than my honest Poll, my wonder ceased,and reaching
out my hand, and calling famiiiarly Poll, the creature came
to me and perched upon my thumb as he was wont, con-
stantly prating to me with " Poor Robinson Crusoe, and
"how did 1 come here, and where had I been I" as.if t»e
bird was overjoyed to see me; and so I took him home
along with me.
I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea;
yet I could wish my boat, which had cost me so much
trouble and pains, on this side the island once more, but
which indeed was impracticable.
I therefore began to lead a very retired life, living near
a twelvemonth in a very contented manner,wanting for no-
thing except conversation. As to machanic labours, which
my necessities obliged me to, I fancied I could, upon oc-
casion, make a tolerable carpenter were the poor tools I
had to work withal but good. Besides, as I improved in
my earthen ware, I contrived to make them with a wheel,
which I found much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which before was rude and ugly. But I think, I
was never so elevated with my own performance or pro-
ject, than for being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which
though it proved an awkward clumsy thing, yet it was
very sound, and carried the smoke perfectly well, to my
great satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware making me abund-
ance of necessary baskets, which though not very hand-
some, were very handy and convenient to fetch things
home, in, as also for holding my stores, barley, rice and
other provisions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine after
•what manner I should kill the goats or birds to live on af-
ter it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways
to ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive,
particularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire
for making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, I
found one morning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and
in the other three kids, one male, the other two females.
So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him
away. But I forgot the old proverb," that hunger will
"tame a lion:" For had I kept him three or four days
without provisions, and then giving him some water, with
a little corn, he would have been as tame as a young kid.
The other creatures I bound with strings together ; but I
had great difficuly before I could bring them to my habi-
tation, It was some time before they wouldfeed, but throw-
ing them sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they
began to be tamer. From hence I concluded, that if I de-
signed to furnish myself with goat's flesh, when my ammu-
nition was spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock
of sheep, about my settlement, was the only method I
could take. I concluded also I must separate the wild
from the tame, or else they would always run wild as they
grew up ; and the best way for this, was to have some in-
closed piece of ground well fenced, either with a hedge
or pale, to keep them so effectually, that those within
might not break out, or those without break in. Such aa
undertaking was very great for one pair of hands; but as
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first care
was to find a convenient piece of ground where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water to drink, and
cover to keep them from the sun.
Here again I gave another instance of my ignorance and
inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow land so
large, that had I inclosed it, the hedge or pale must have
been at least two miles about. Indeed had it been ten
miles, I had time enough to do it in ; but then I did not
consider that my goats would be as wild in so much com-
pass, as if they had had the whole island, and consequent-
, ly as difficult for me to catch them. This thought came
into my head, after 1 had carried it on, I believe, about fif-
ty yards; 1 therefore altered my scheme, and resolved to
inclose a piece of ground about one hundred and fifty
yards in length, and one hundred in breadth, sufficient
enough for as many as would maintain me, till such time
as my flock increased, and then I could add more ground.
I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and it took me,
about three months in hedging the first piece; in which
time I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, feed-
ing them as near me as possible, to make them familiar:
and indeed I very often would carry some ears of barley
or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; by
which they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was fin-
ished, and I had let them loose, they would run after me
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered my end;
and in a year and a half's time I had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years after, they
amounted to forty-three, besides what I had taken and kil-
led for my sustenance. After which I inclosed five seve-
ral pieces of ground to feed them m, with pens to drive
them into, that I might take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional blessings: for
I not only had plenty of goat's flesh, but mi'k too, which
F
in ray beginning I did not so much as think of. And
indeed, though I Jiad never milked a cow, much-less a
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet after some es-
says and miscarriages, I made me both, and never after-
jyards wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities?
How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give
us reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons? what
a-bounteou-s table was here spread in a wilderness for me,
where I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger.
Certainly a Sto'iCiwould have smiled to see me.at dinner.
There sat my royal majesty, an absolute prince and ru-
Jer of my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom
if I pleased, I could either hang,draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it .away. When I dined, I seemed a king
eating alone, none daring to persume to do so till Ihad
•done. Poll, as if he had been my principal court favourite,
was the only person permitted to talk with me. 'My old
•but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who
had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually sat
.on my right hand; while my two cats sat on each side of
the table, expecting a bit 'from my hand, as a principal
mark of my royal favour. These were not the cats I had
.brought from the ship; they had been dead long before,
and interred near my habitation by mine own hand. But
one of them, as I suppose, generating with a wild cat, a
couple of their young I had made tame; the rest run wild
into the woods, and in time grew so impudent as to return
and plunder me of my stores, till such time as I shot a
.great many, and the rest left me without troubling me
any more. In this plentiful manner did I live, wanting
for nothing but conversation. One thing indeed concern-
ed me, the want of my boat ; I knew not which way to
get 'her round the island. One time I resolved togo
along the shore by land to her; but had any one in Eng-
land met such a figure, it would either have affrighted
them, or made them burst into laughter; nay I could not
but smile myself at my habit, which I tliink in this place
will be very proper to describe.
The cap I wore on my head.was great, high, and shapc-
Iess,'made of a goat's skin, with a flap or pent-house hang-
ing down behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but
to shoot the rain off from running into my neck, nothing-
being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh
in these climates. I had a short jacket of goat's skin,
whose hair hung down such a length on each side, that if
reached down to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and
stockings, I had none, but made a semblance of semething,
I know not what to call them; they were made like bus-
kins, and laced on the sides like spatterdashes, barbarous-
ly shaped like the rest of my hubit. I had a broad bejt
of goat's skin driedigirt round me with a couple of thongs,
instead of buckles; on each of which, to supply the de-
. ficiency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and saw.
1 had another belt, not so broad yet fastened in the same
manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the end ot'
it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, made of goat's
sljin, to hold my powder and shot. My basket I carried
on my back, and my gun on my shoulder; and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, which
however, next to my gun, was the most necessary thing
about me. As for my face, the colour was not so swar-
thy as the Mulattoes, or might have been expected from
one who took so little care of it, in a climate within nine
or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time my be'ard
grevr so long that it hung down about a quarter of a yard;
but as I had both razors and scissors in store, I cm it all
off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair of Ma-
hometan whiskers, the like f)f which I had seen wore by
some Turks at Sallee, not long enough indeed to hang a
hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there being
none to observe my behaviour or habit. And so without
fear and without controul, I proceeded on my journey, the
prosecution of which took me up five or six days. I first
travelled along the sea-shore, directly to the place where
I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks;
but now having no boat to take care of, I went overland a
nearer way to the same height that I was before upon;
•when looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat I was
amazed to see the sea so s/nooth and quiet, there being
no ripling motion, nor current, any more than in other
places. This made me ponder some time to guess the
reason of it, when at last I was convinced that the ebb set-
tkigfrom the west, and joining with the current of water'
from some great river on shore, must be the occasion of
these rapid streams ; and that, consequently, as the winds
blew more westwardly, or more southwardly, so the cur-
rent came the nearer, or went the farther from the shore.
To satisfy my curiosity, I waited there till evening, when
the time of ebb being made, I plainly perceived from the
rock the current again as before, with this difference,that
it ran farther off, near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my expedition, it set close upon it, furiously
hurrying ma and my canoe along with it, which at another
time it would not have done. And now I was convinced,
that, by observing the ebbing and flowmg of the tide, I
might easily bring my boat round the island again. But
when I began to think of putting it in practice, the re-
membrance of the late danger struck me with horror,that
I changed my resolution and formed another, which was
more safe, though more laborious; and this was to make
another canoe, and so have one for one side of the island,
and one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the first my
little fortification)fort or castle, with many large and spa-
cious improvements; for by this time I had enlarged the
cave behind me with several little caves,one with another,
to hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with
which I made my wall were grown so lofty and great as
obscured my habitation. And near this commodious and
pleasant settlement, lay my well-cultivated and improved
corn-fields, which kindly yielded me their fruit in the pro-
per season. My second plantation was that near my
country-seat, or little bow.ar, where my grapes flourished,
and where, having planted many stakes, I made inclo-
sures for my goats, so strongly fortified by labour and
time, that it was much stronger than a wall, and conse-
quenily impossible for them to break through. As for my
bower itself; I kept it constantly in repair, and cut the
trees in such a manner, as made them grow thick and wild
and form a delightful shade. In the centre of this stood
my tent, thus erected. I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece of a ship's sail ; be-
neath which I made a sort of a couch with the skins of
the creatures I had slain, and other things ; and having
laid thereon one of the sailor's blankets, which I had sa%'-
ed from the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with
a great watch-coat, I took up this place for my country
retreat.
Very frequently from this settlement, did I use to visit
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And some-
times I would venture in her acast or two from shore, but
no farther, lest either u strong current, a sudden stormy
wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from
the island as before. But now I entreat your attention,
whilst I proceed to inform you of a new, but most surpris-
ing scene of life which herebefel me.
You may easily suppose that after having been here so
long nothing could be more amazing than to see a hu-
man creature.
One day it happened that going to my boat, I saw the
print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evident on
the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of it. Had I seen
an apparition in the most frightful shape, I could not have
been more confounded. My willing ears gave the strictest
attention. I cast my eyes around, but could satisfy neither
the one nor the other. I proceeded alternately to every
partof the shore, but with equal effect ; neither couldlsee
any other mark, though the sand about it was as suscepti-
ble to take impression, as that which was so plainly stamp-
ed- Thus struck with confusion and horror, I returned to
my habitation, frightened at every bush and tree, taking
every thing for men ; and possessed with the wildest ideas!
that night my eyes never closed. I formed nothingbut the
most dismal imaginations, concluding it must be the mark
of the devil's foot which I had seen for otherwise how
eould any mortal come to this island ? where was the ship
that transported them ? and what signs of any other foot-
steps ? though these seemed very strong icasons for such
a supposition, yet (thought I) why should the devil make
the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can see, when he
might have taken other ways to have terrified me? why
should he leave his mark on the other side of the island-,
and that too on the sand, where the surging waves of the
ocean might soon have erused the impression.
Surely this action is not consistent with the subtilty of
Satan, said I to myself; but rather must be some danger*
ous creature, some wild savage of the main land over
against me, that, venturing too far in the ocean, has been
driven here, either by the violent currents or contrary
winds; and not caring to stay on this desolate island, has
gone back to sea again.
F 2
Happy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the sava-
ges had seen me in that place: yet I was not altogether
without fear, lest, having found my boat, they should re-
turn in numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all
my corn and destroy my flock of tame goats. In a word
all my religious hopes vanished, as though I thought God
•would not now protect me by his power, who had so won-
derfully preserved me so long.
What various chains of Providence are there in the life
of man? How changeable are our affections, according to
different circumstances? we love to-day, what we hate
to-morrow, we shun one hour, what we seek the next.
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous man-
ner ; for I who before had so much lamented my condition,
in being banished from all human kind, was now even
ready to expire, when I considered that a man had set his
foot on this desolate island. But when I considered my
station of life decreed by the infinitely,wise and good pro-
vidcncs of God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's
sovereignty, who has an unbounded right to govern and
dispose of his creatures as he thinks convenient ; and that
his jusiice and mqrcy could either punish or deliver me;
I say, when I considered all this, I comfortably found it
my duty to trust sincerely in him, pray ardently to him
and humbly resign myself to this divine will.
One morning, lying on my bed,/these words of the sa-
cred writings came to my mind," Call upon me in the day
"of trouble, and I will deliver thee,, and thou shall glori-
"fynte." Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully
from my bed, I offered up my prayers in the most hea-
venly manner ; and when I had done, taking up my Bible
tp road, these words appeared first in my sight:—" Wait
'» on the Lord, and be of good cheer, andhc shall strength-
"en ihy heart: Wait, I say, on the Lord." Such divine
comfort did this give me, as to remove all cause of sad-
ness upon that occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, for three
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and
milked my goats one of which was almost spoiled for want
of it. I next (ihough in great fear) visited mybower, and
milked my flocks there also; when,growingbolderl went
down to the shore again, and measuring the print of the
foot to mine to see, perhaps, whether I myself had not
occasioned that mark> I foun,d it much Superior in large*
*
ness,and so returned home, now absolutely convinced that
either some men had been ashore, or that the island must
be inhabited, and therefore that I might be surprised be-
fore I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my security , and
resolved in my mind many different schemes for that pur-
pose. I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and
turn my tame cattle wild into the woods that the enemy
might not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of
killing the same. Secondly, I was for digging up my
corn fields, for the very same reason. And lastly, I con-
cluded to demolish my bower, lest, seeing a place of hu-
man contrivance, they might come farther and find out and
attack me in my little castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me ; and
I looked I thought like the unfortunate king Saul, when
not only oppressed by the Philistines, but also forsaken by-
God himself. And it is strange, that a little before, having
entirely resigned myself to the will of God, I should now
have little confidence in him, fearing those more who
could kill this fading body, than him who could destroy
my immortal soul.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night ; yet
nature, spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the
next morning, and then joining reason with fear, I consi-
dered that this delightful and pleasant island might not be
so entirely forsaken as I might think ; but that the inhabi-
tants from the other shore might sail, either with designer
from necessity, by cross winds ; and if the latter circum-
stance, 1 had reason to believe they would depart the first
opportunity. However my fear made me think of a place,
for retreat upon an attack. I now repented that I hadm^de
my door to come out beyond my fortification ; to remedy
which, I resolved to make me a second one : I fell to work,
therefore, and drove betwixt that double rowof trees, which
I planted above twelve years before, several strong piles
thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
strengthening the foot of it with earth which I dug out of
my cave ; I also made me seven holes wherein I planted
my muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resem-
bling carriages. This being finished with indefatigable in-
dustry, for a great way every where, I planted sticks of
osier like a wood, about twenty thousand of them, leaving a
large space between them and my wall, that I might have
room to see an enemy, and that they might not be shelter-
ed among the youirg trees, if they offered to approach the
outer wall Am! indeed, scarce two years had passed over
my head, when there appeared a lovely shady grove, and
in six years it became u thick wood, perfectly impassable. ,
For my safety, I left no avenue to go in or out; instead of
which I set two ladders, one to a part of a rock which was
low and then broke in, leaving room to place another lad-
der upon that; so that when I took these down, it was im-
possible for any man to descend without hurting himself ;,
and if they had, they would still be at the outside of my
outer wall. But while 1 took all these measures of hu-.
man prudence for my own preservation I was not altogeth-
er unmindful of other affairs. To preserve my stock of
tame goats, tba't the enemy should not take all at once, I
looked out for the most retired part of the island, which
was the place where I had lost myself before-mentioned,
and there finding a clear piece of land, containing three
acres, surrounded with thick woods, I wrought so hard,
that in less than a month's time, I fenced it so well round,
that my flocks were very well secured in it, and put there-
in two he-goats and ten she ones.
All this labour was occasioned purely byf earful appre-
hensions, on account of seeing the print of a man's foot;
and not contented yet with what I had done, I searched for
another place towards the west point of the island, where I
might also retain another flock. Then wandering on this
errand more to the west of the island than ever I had yet
done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, me thought I
perceived a boat ata great distance ; but could not possibly
tell what it was for want of my perspective glass. I con-
sidered then it was no strange thing to see the print of a
man's foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed God for
being cast on the other side of the island, where none of
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But when I came
down the hill to the shore, which was the S W. point of
the island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion ; nor can
any one describe my horror and amazement, when 1 saw
the ground* spread with sculls, hands, feet and bones of
human bodies , and, particulary,; perceived a space like
a circle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about, which
I conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacri-
ficed and devoured their fellow creatures.
The horrorand loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle,
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from
my stomach in an excessive manner. I then re-turned to-
wards my habitation ; and in my way thither, shedding
floods of tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave
God thanks for making my nature contrary to these
wretches, and delivering me so long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here had assur-
ed me, that these savages never came up to the thick woody
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre-
hensive of a discovery ; yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that for two years after, I confined myself only to
my three plantations ; I mean my castle, country-seat,
and inclosure in the woods. And though in process of
time my dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet
ray eyes were more vigilant for feai of being surprised,
and 1 was very cautious of firing my gun, lest being heard
by those creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I
resolved, however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and
went armed with three pistols stuck in my girdle, which
added to the description I have given of myself before,
made me look with a very formidable appearance.
Thus my circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed; and when I compared my condi-
tion to others, I found it far from being miserable. And,
indeed, would all persons compare their circumstances,
not with those above them, but with those innumerable
unhappy objects beneath them, I am sure we should not
hear those daily murmurings and complainings that are
in the world. For'my part I wanted but few things. In-
deed the terror which the savages had put me in, spoiled
some inventions for my own conveniences. One of my
projects was to brew me some beer; a very whimsical
one indeed, when it is considered that I had neither casks
sufficient, nor could I make any to preserve it in ; neither
hud 1 hops to make it keep, yeast to make it work, nor a
copper or kettle to make it boil. Perhaps indeed, after
some years I might bring this to bear, as I had done oth-
er things. But now my inventions were placed another
way; and day and night I could think of nothing but how
I might destroy some of these cannibals when proceeding
to their bloody entertainments ; and so saving a victim
from being sacrificed, that he might after become my ser-
vant. Many were.my contrivances after this purpose,
and as many more objections occurred, after I hatched
them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their fire, and put therein five or six
pounds of gunpowder, wXich would consequently blow up
all those that were near it; but then 1 was loth to spend
so much upon them, lest it should not do that certain ex-
ecution I could desire, and but only affright, and not kill
them. Having laid this design aside, I again proposed to
myself to lie privately in ambush, in some convenient
place, with my three guns double loaded, and let fly at
them in the midst of their dreadful ceremony ; and hav-
ing killed two or three of them at every shot, fall upon
the rest suddenly with my three pistols, and not let one
mother's son escape. This imagination pleased my fancy
so much, that I used to dream of it in the night time. To
put my design in execution, I was not long in seeking for
a place convenient for my purpose, where unseen I might
behold evei y action of the savages. Here I placed my two
muskets, each of which was loaded with a pair of slugs,
and four or five smaller bullets about the size of pistolbul-
lets ; the fowling piece was charged with near a handful
of the largest swan-shot, and in every pistol were about
four bulleU. And thus all things being prepared, no soon-
er would the welcome light spread over the element but,
like a giant refreshed with wine, as the Scripture has it,
would I issue forth from my castle, and from a lofty hill
three miles distant, view if I could see any invaders ap-
proach unlawfully to my kingdom. But having waited in
vain two or three months, it not only became very tire-
some to me, but also brought me to some consideration,
and made me examine myself, what right I had to kill
these creatures in this manner.
If, argued I to myself, this unnatural custom of theirs'
be a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine
Being, who alone has the vindictive power in his hands,
to shower down his vengeance upon them. And perhaps
he does so, in making them become one another's execu-
tioners. Or, if not, if God thinks these doings just, ac-
cording to the knowledge they conceive, what authority
have I to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence,
which has permitted these actions for so many ages, per-
haps from almost the beginning of the creation? They
never offended me, what right have I then to concern my-
self in their shedding one another's blood? And indeed I
>
have since known, they value no more to kill and devour
a captive taken in war, then we dotokill an ox or eat mut-
ton. 1 then concluded it necessarily followed, that these
people were no more murderers than Christians who ma-
ny times put whole troops to the sword, after throwing
down their arms.—Again, I considered that, if I fell upon
them, I should be as much in the wrong as the Spaniards
who had committed the greatest barbarities upon these
people who had never offended them in their whole lives;
as if the kingdom of Spain was eminent for a race of men
without common commission to the miserable, a princi-
pal sign of the most generous temper : these considera-
tions made me pause, and made me think I had taken
wrong measures in my resolution: I now argued with
myself, it was better for me never to attack, but to remain
undiscovered as long as I possibly could ; that an opposite
conduct would certainly prove destructive; for it was not
to be supposed I could kill them all, and might either be
overpowered by the remaining, or, some escaping, might
bring thousands to my certain destruction. And indeed,
religion took their part so much, as to convince me how
contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding hu-
man blood innocent as to my particular, whatever they
are to one another; that 1 had nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said be-
fore, to do therein what seemed convenient to his heaven-
ly wisdom. And therefore, on my knees, I thanked Al-
mighty God for delivering me from blood-guiltinesa, and
begged his protection that I might never fall into their
hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly began
I never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards: I
only removed rriy boat which lay on the other side of the
island, and every thing that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there might not be the least
shadow of any boat near or habitation upon the island —
My castle then becamemy cell,keeping always retired on-
ly when I went out to milk my she-goats, and order my
little flock in the wood, which was quite out of danger;
for sure I was that these savages never come here with
expectations to fmd any thing and consequently never
•wandered from the coast; however, as they might have
several times been on shore, as well before as after my
dreadful apprehensions,I looked back with horror to think
in what state I might hare been, had I suddenly met them
slenderly armed, with one gun only loaded with small
shot; and how great would have been my amazement, it'
instead of seeing the print of one man's foot, I had per-
ceived fifteen or twenty savages, who having once set
their eyes upon me, by the swiftness of their feet would
have left me no possibility of escaping? These thoughts
would sink my very soul, so that I would fall into a deep
melancholy, till such time as the consideration of my gra-
titude to the Divine Being moved it from my heart. I then
fell into a contemplation of the sacred springs of Provi-
dence, and how wonderfully we are delivered, when sensi-
ble of it; and when intricated in uncertain mazes or la-
byrinths of doubt or hesitation, what secret hint directs us
in the right way, when we intend to go out of it ; nay per-
haps contrary to our business, sense, or inclination. Upon
whichi I fixed within me this as a certain rule, never to
disobey those secret impressions of the mind, to the act-
ing or not acting any thing that offered, for which I yet
could assign no reason. But let it be how it will, the ad-
vantage of this conduct very eminently appeared in the
latter part of my abode on this island ; I am a stranger in
determining whence these secret intimations of Provi-
dence derive ; yet methinks they are not only some proof
of the converse of spirits, but also of the secret communi-
cations they are supposed to have with those that have not
passed through the gloomy vale of death.
These anxieties of mind-, and the care of my preserva-
tion, put a period to all future inventions and contrivances,
either for accommodation or convenience. I now cared
not to drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire,
lest either the noise' should be heard, or the smoke disco-
ver me And on this account I used to burn my earthen
•ware privately in a cave which I found in the wood, and
•which I made convenient for that purpose ; the principal
cause that brought me here was to make charcoal, so that
I might bake and dress my bread and meat without any
danger. At that time a curious accident happened me
which I shall now relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for making my
charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch
of underwood. Curious to look into it,/I attained its
mouth, and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright
in. But when I had entered, and took a further view.
two rolling shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to dart
themselves at me; so that' I made all the haste out that t
could, as not knowingwhether itwas the devil oramonster
that had taken his residence in that place. When I recov-
ered a little from my surprise, I called myself a thousand
ibols,for being afraid to see the devil one moment, who had
now lived almost twenty years in the most retired solitude.
And therefore resuming all the courage I had, I took a
flaming firebrand,and rushed in again. I had not proceeded
above three steps, when I was more affrighted than be-
fore; for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a
human creature in the greatest agony, succeeded with a
noise,resembling words half expressed, and then a bro-
ken sigh again. Stepping back, Lord! (thought I to
myself)where and in what enchanted place have Iplunged
myself, such as are reported tf contain miserable captives
till tles'h putsan end to their sorrows ? And indeed, in such
great amaze'.-nent was I, that it struck me with a cold sweat,
and had my hat been on, it is probable my hair would have
moved it off. But again encouraging myself with the
hope of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the
light of my firebrand, perceived it to he a monstrous he-
goat lying on the ground, gasping for life, and dying of
mere old age. At first I stirred him, thinking to drive him
out, but the poor ancient creature strove to get upon his
feet but was not able; so I e'en let him lie still to affright
the savages, should they venture into this cave. I now look-
ed round me and found the place but small and shapeless.
At-the farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance,
yet so low, as must oblige me to creep upon my hands
and knees to it; so having no candle, I suspended my
enterprise till the next day, and then I came provided
with Uvo large ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my hands and feet, through this
strait, I found'the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet.
But surely mortal never saw such a glorious sight before!
the roof and walls of this cave reflected a hundred thou-
sand lights to me from my two candles, as though they
were indented with shining gold, precious stones, or spark-
ling diamonds. And indeed it was the most delightful ca-
vity or grotto of its kind that could be desired though en-
tirely dark. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind
of gravel upon it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be
seen there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could
G
no fault but in the entrance, and I began to think ihat
even this might be very necessary for my defence, and
therefore resolved to make it my most principal magazine,
I brought hither two fowling pieces, and three muskets,
leaving only five pieces at my castle, planted in the nature
of cannon. 'Of the barrel of gunpowder, which I took up
out of the sea, I brought away about sixty pounds of good
powder, which was not damaged, and removed this, with
a great quantity of lead for bullet, from my castle to this
retreat, now fortified both by art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who
were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, ihac
cessible to any but themselves, or at least, most danger-
ous to attempt. And now I despised both the cunning;
and strength of the savages, either to find me out or to
hurt me.
But I must not forget the old goat, which caused my
late dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up
•he ghost the day after my discovery ; and it being diffi-
cult to drag him.out, I dug his grave, and honourably en-
tombed him in the same place where he departed, with
as much ceremony as any Welch goat that has been in-
terred about the high mountain Penmanmawr.
I think it was now the tweny-third year of my reign,
and my thoughts were much easier than formerly, having
contrived several pretty amusements and diversions to
pass away the time in a pleasant manner. By this time
my pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and pro-
nounce his words very articulately and plain; so that for
hours we used to chat together after a familiar manner,
and he lived with me no less than twenty-six years. My
dog, which was nineteen years old, sixteen of which he
lived with me, died some time ago of mere old age. As
for my cats they multiplied so fast, that I was forced to
kill or drive them into the woods, except two or three
which became my particular favourites. Besides these, I
continually kept two or three household kids about me,
which would feed out of my hand, and two more parrots
that could talk indifferently, and call Robinson Crusoe, but
not so excellently as the first, as not taking that pains with
them. I had also several sea-fowls which I had wounded
and cut their wings ; and growing tame, they used to breed
among the low trees about my castle walls, all which
made my abode very agreeable.
• Butwhatunforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment of this uncertain state of life, when we least expect
them ! it was now in the month of December, in the south-
- ern solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which re,-
quired my attendance in the fields; when going out pretty
early one morning, before itwas day-light, there appeared
to me, from the sea-shore a flaming light, about two miles
from me at the east end of the island, where I observed
some savages had been before, not on the other side, but
to my great affliction, it was on my side the island.
. Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements,
I returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after
me, making all things look as wild and natural as I possi-
bly could. In the next place, I put myself into a posture
of defence, loading my muskets and pistols, and commit-
ting myself to God's protection, 1 resolved to defend my-
self till my last breath. Two hours after, impatient for
intelligence, I set my ladder up to the side of the hill
where there was a flat place, and then pulling the ladder,
after me ascended to the top, where laying myself on my
belly, with my perspective glass, I perceived no less than
nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire, eating as I
supposed human flesh, with their two canoes hauled on
shore waiting for the flood to carry them off again. Yon
cannot easily express the consternation I was in at this
sight, especially seeing them near me; but when I per-
ceived their coming must be always with the current of the
ebb, I became more ea..•., in my thoughts, being fully con-
vinced that I might go abroad with security all the tirnu
of flood, if they were not before landed. And indeed, this
proved just as I magined ; for no sooner did they all take
boat and paddle away, but the tide made N. W. Before
they went off, they danced, making ridiculous postures
and gestures for above an hour, all start-naked ; but whe-
ther men or women, or both, I could not perceive. When
I saw them gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders,
and placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with my great,
sword, I went to the hill where 1 first made a discovery of
these cannibals, and then saw.there had been three canoes
more of the savages on shore at the place, which with the
rest were making over to the main land.
But nothing could be more honid to me, when going
to the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other
mangled parts of human bodies appeared in my sight;
and so fired was I with indignation, thatl was fully resolv-
ed to be revenged on the first that came there, though I
lost my life in the execution. It then appeared to me,
that the visits which they make to this island are not very
frequent, it being fifteen months before they came again;
but still I was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal appre-
hensions of their surprising me unawares ; nor dared I
offer to fire a gun on that side of the island where they
used to appear, lest taking the alarm, the savages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God knows
in what manner I should have made my end. Thus was
I a year or more before I saw any of these devouring
cannibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in
revenging myself on those Heathens.
On the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun-
dance of lightning and thunder all day, and succeeded by
a very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens
made me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I was seri-
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a
minute, when with my ladder, ascending the mountain as
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the re-
port of another gun, which I presently heard, and found
it was from that part of the sea v, ».ere the current drove
me away. I could not but then think, that this must be
a ship in distress and that these were the melancholy sig-
nals for a speedy deliverance. Great indeed was my sor-
row upon this occasion ; but my labours to assist them
must have proved altogether vain and fruitless. However
I brought together all the dry wood that was at hand, and
making a pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. 1
was certain they plainly perceived it, by their firing anoth-
er gun as soon as it began to blaze, and after that several
more from the same quarter. All night long I kept up
my fire : and when the air cleared up, I perceived some-
thing a great way at sea, directly E. but could not distin-
guish what it was, even with my glass, by reason the wea-
ther was so very foggy out at sea. However, keeping my
eyes directly fixed upon it, and perceiving it did not stir,
I presently concluded it must be a ship at anchor, and so
very hasty I was to be satisfied, that taking the g^n, I
went to the S. E. part of the island, to the same rocks
•where I had been formerly drove away by the current; in
which time the weather being perfectly cleared up,to.my
great sorrow I perceived the wreck of a ship cast away
upon those hidden rocks I found when I was out with my
boat; and which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the
occasion of my preservation.
Thus, whatisone man's safety is another's ruin; for un-
doubtedly this ship had been driven on them in the night,
the wind blowing strong at E N. E. Had they perceives
the island, as now 1 guessed they had not, certainly,instead
of firing their guns for help, they would rather have ven-
tured in their boat, and saved (Themselves that way. I then,
thought that perhaps they had done so, upon seeing my
fire, and were cast away in the attempt; for I perceived
no boat in the ship-
But then I again imagined, that perhaps, they had ano- ,
ther vessel in company, which upon signal, saved their
lives, and took the boat up, or that the boat might be driv-
en into the main ocean, where these poor creatures might
be in the most miserable condition. But as ail these conjec-
tures were very uncertain, I could do no more than com-
miserate their distress and thank God for delivering me
in particular, when so many perished in the raging ocean.
. When I considered seriously every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose any of them
saved, I cannot explain by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often breaking out
in this manner ; "O that there had been but two or three,
"nay even one person saved, that we might have lived to-
"gether, conversed with; and comforted one another !"and
so much were my desires moved, that when I repeated
these words, " Oh ! that there had been but one I" my
hands would clench together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands so close, that had any soft thing been
between, it would have crushed it involuntarily, while my
teeth would strike together, and set against each other
so strong, that it required some time for me to part
them.
Till the last year of my being on this island. I never
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship,
I had the affliction, some time after, to see the corps of a
G 2
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the island which
was^next the shipwreck; there was nothing on him but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt, but no particular mark to guess
what nation he was of: in his pocket were two pieces of
eight, and a tobacco pipe, the last of which I preferred
much more than I did the first.
And now the calmness of the sea temped me to venture
out in my boat to this wreck not only to get something ne-
cessary out of the ship, but perhaps some living creature
might be on board, whose life I might preserve. This had
such an influence upon my mind, that immediately I went
home and prepared every thing necessary for the voyage,
carrying on board my boat provision of all sorts, with a
good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a compass, so put-
ting off, I paddled the canoe along the shore, till I came
at last to the north-east part of the island, from whence I
was to launch into the ocean ; but here the current ran so
violently, and appeared so terrible, that my heart began to
fail me; foreseeing that if I was driven into any of these
currents, I might be carried not only out of the reach
or sight of the island, but even inevitably lost in the boil-
ing surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over
my enterpriae,-sailing to a little creek on the shore, where
stepping out, I set me down on a rising hill, very pensive
, and thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned,
/and the flood'came on, which made it impracticable for
me to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how
the sets of the tides or currents lay when the flood came
in, I ascended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked
the seaboth ways; and here I found that as the current of
the ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so
the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the
north side ; and all that I had to do, was te keep to the
north of the island in my return.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with
my watch coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my
tester. I set out with the first of the tide full north, till I
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
fate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as
to take from me all government ot my canoe; so that in
two hours time I came up to the wreck, which appeared to
*ne a,most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish
vessel by its building, stuck fast between two rocks; her'
stern and quarter-beaten to pieces by the sea; her main-
mast and foremast were brought off by the board, that is
broken off short. As I approached near, I perceived a dog
on board, who seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and no
sooner did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famished with
hunger and thirst, so that when I gave him a cake of bread,
no ravenous wolf could devour it,more greedily, and he
drank to that degree of fresh water that he would have
burst himself, had I suffered him.
The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cook-room or forecastle, inclosed in one
another's arms; hence I very probably supposed, that
when the vessel struck in the storm, so high and incessant-
ly did the waters break in and over her, that the men not
being able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rush-
ing in of the waves. There were several casks of liquor,
•whether wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay
in the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebb-
ing out of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend
to meddle with, likewise I perceived several chests, which
I supposed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got
into my boat without examining what was in them. Had
the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken
off, I should have made a very prosperous voyage ; since,
by what I after found in these two chests, I could not
otherwise conclude, but that the ship must have abundance
of wealth on board; nayif I must guess by the course she
steered, she must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres
or the Rio de la Plata, in the southern parts of America,
beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the gulph of
Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. What became of the
rest of the sailors, I could not certainly tell ; and all her
riches signified nothing at that time to any body.
Searching further, I found a cask, containing about iwen-
ly gallons, full of liquor, which with some labour, I got in-
to my boat; in her cabin were several muskets, which I let
remain there, but took away with me a great powder horn,
•vvith about four pounds of powder in it. I took also a fire-
shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to make
.chocolate, and a gridiron, all which were extremely neces-
sary to me, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And so
with this cargo, accompanied with my dog, 1 came away,
the tide serving for that purpose, and the same eve ning
about an hour within night, I attained the island, after the
greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my wearied limbs in the boat, re-
solving the next morning to harbour what I had gotten in
my new-found subterraneous grotto ; and not to carry my
cargo home to my ancient castle Having refreshed my-
self, and got all my effects on shore, 1 next proceeded to
examine the particulars ; and so tapping the cask. I found
the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had at
the Brazils, nor indeed near so good At the opening of
the chest, several things appeared very useful to me ; for
instance, 1 found in one a very fine case oi bottles, contain-
ing the fine and best sorts of cordial waters ; each bottle
held about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I fouad
also two pots full ofthe choicest sweetmeats, and two more
which the water had utterly spoiled. There were likewise
several good shirts exceedingly welcome to me, and about
one dozen and a half white linen handkerchiefs and colour-
.ed neckcloihs, the lormer of which was absolutely neces-
sary for wiping my face in a hot day; and in the till, found
three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hundred in all,
In one of which, decently wrapped up in a piece of paper
were six doubloons of gold, and some small bars and wedg-
es of the same metal, which I believe might weigh near
a pound : in the other chest, which I guessed to belong to
the gunner's mate, by the mean circumstances which at-
tended it, I found only some clothes of very little value,
except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three
flasks, kept as I believe, for charging their fowling-pieces
on any occasion; so that, on the whole, I had no great ad-
vantage by this voyage.
The money was mdeed as mere dirt to me, useless and
unprofitable, all which I would have freely parted with for
twoor three pair ofEnglish shoes and stockings,things that
for many years I had not worn, except lately those which I
had taken off the feet of those unfortunate men that were
drowned in the wreck, yet not so good as English shoes
eitherforease or service. I also found in theseaman's chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; so conclud-
ed that what I took from the first belonged toan officer,the
latter appearingto haveamuch inferior person for its own-
er. However, as despicable as the money seemed, I like-
wise lugged it to my cave, laying it up securely, as I did
the rest of my cargo, and after all this was done, I return-
.ed back to my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I
came to my old harbour, when I carefully laid her up, and
so made the best of my way to my castle : when I arrived
there, every thing seemed safe and quiet, so that now my
only business was to repose myself after my wonted man-
ner and take care of my domestic affairs. But though I
might have lived very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely
needful ; yet still I was more vigilant than usual upon ac-
count of the savages, never going much abroad, or if I did,
it was to the east part of the island, where I was well as-
sured that the savages, never came, and where I might not
be troubled to carry that heavy load of weapons for my de-
fence, as I was obliged to do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all
which time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head
was filled with nothing but projects and designs, how I
might escape from this island; and so much were my
wandering thoughts bent upon a rambling disposition that
had I had the same boat that I went from Sallec in, I
should have ventured once more jqjhe uncertainty ofthj3_
raging ocean.
I cannot however, but consider myself as one of the
unhappy persons, who make themselves wretched by their
dissatisfaction with the stations which God has placed them
in; for, not to take a review of my primitive condition,
and my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to
which, was as I may say, my original sin, the following
mistakes of the same nature certainly had been the means
of my present unhappy station. What business had 1 to
leave a settled fortune, and well stocked plantation, im-
proving and increasing, where by this time, I might have
been worth a hundred thousand moidores, to turn super-
cargo to Guinea, to fetch negroes, when time and patience
would so much enlarge my stock at home, as to be able
to employ those whose more immediate business it was,
to fetch them home even to my door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young heads, so a
serious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily attends the
exercise of future years,when the dear bought experience
of time teaches us repentance. Thus wash with me ; but
notwithstanding the thoughts of my deliverance ran so
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the dic-
tates of reason and philosophy. And now to usher in my
kind reader with greater pleasure to the remaining part
of my relation, I flatter myself it will not be taken amiss,
to give him an accountofmy first conceptions of the man-
ner of escaping, and upon what foundation I laid down my
foolish schemes-
Having retired to my castle, after my late voyage to the
ship, my frigate .laid up and secured as usual, and my con-
dition the same as before, except being richer, though I
had as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had
for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them:
one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and
twentieth year of solitude, I lay down to sleep, very vcllin
health, without distemper, pain or uncommon uneasiness,
either of body or mind ; yet notwithstanding, I could not
compose myself to sleep all the night long. All this
tedious while it is impossible to express what innumera-
ble thoughts came into my head.
I traced quite over the whole history ofmy life in min-
iature, from my utmost remembrance of things till I came
to this island, and then proceeded to examine every action
undpassage that had occurred since I had. taken possession
ofmy kingdom. In my reflections upon the latter, I was
comparing the happy posture of myaffairs in the beginning
ofmy reign, to this life of anxiety, fearand concern, since
I had discovered a print of a foot in the sand : that while
I continued without apprehension, I wasincapable of feel-
ing the dread and terror I now suffered How thankful
rather ought I to have been for the knowledge of my dan-
ger, since the greatest happiness one can be possessed of,
is to have sufficient time to provide against it ! How stu-
pendous isthe goodness of ProvideBce,whichsetssuch nar-
row bounds to the sight andknowledge of human nature,
that while men walk in the midst of so many dangers they
are kept serene and calm, by having the events of things
hid from their, eyes and knowing nothing of those many
dangers thut surround them, till perhaps they are dissi-
pated and vanish away.
When I came more particularly to consider of the real
danger I had for so many years escaped, how I walked
about in the greatest security and tranquility, at a time per-
haps, when even nothing but the brow ofa hill, a great tree
or the common approach of night, had interposed between
me and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who would
devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a pigeon or
curlew; surely all this, I say, could not but make me
sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose singular
protection I acknowledge with the greatest humility and
without which I must inevitably have fallen into the cruel
hands of those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest man-
ner, according to my weak understanding, I next proceed-
ed to consider the wretched nature of those destroying
savages, by seeming, though with a greatrreverence to in-
quire, why God shouldgive up any of his creatures to such
inhumanity, even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind?
but as this was rather matter of abstruse speculation, and
as my miserable situation made me think this of mine the
most uncomfortable situation in the world, I then began
rather to inquire what part of the world these wretches
lived in; how far off the coast was from whence they
came; why they ventured over so far from home; what
kind of boats conveyed them hither; and why I could
not order myself and my business so, that I might be as
able to attain their country, as they were to come to my
kingdom.
But then, thought I, how shall I manage myself when
I come thither? what will become of me if I fall into the
hands of the savages ? or how shall I escape from them
if they make an attempt upon me? and supposing I
should not fall into their power, what shall I do for provi-
sion, or which way shall I bend my course ? those counter
thoughts threw me into the greatest horror and confusion
imaginable ; but then I looked upon my present condi-
tion to be the most miserable that possibly could be, and
that nothing could be worse, except death. For, thought
I, could I but attain the shore of the main, I might per-
haps meet with some relief, or coast it along as I did with
my boy Xury, on the African shore, till I came to some
inhabited country, where I might meet with some relief
or fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in;
and if I failed, why then I could but meet with death,
which would put an end to all my miseries. These
thoughts, I must confess, were the fruits of a distempered
mind, an impatient temper made desperate, as it were,
by long continuance of the troubles and disappointments I
had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have found
some living person to speak to, by whom I might have
known in what place 1 was, and of the probable means of
my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitat-
ed, my resignation to the will of heaven was entirely sus-
pended ! so that I had no power to fix my mind to any
thing but to the project of a voyage to the main land.
And indeed so much was I inflamed upon this account,
that I set my blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high
as though I had been in a fever; till naUire being as it
•were, fatigued and exhausted with the thoughts of it,made
me submit myself to a silent repose.
In such a situation, it is very strange that I did not
dream of what I was so intent upon ; but instead of it, my
mind roved on a quite different thing, altogether foreign.
I dreamed that as I was issuing from my castle one morn-
ing, as customary, when I perceived upon the shore two
canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, who brought
with them another Indian, whom they designed to make
a sacrifice of, in order to devour; but just as they were
going to give the fatal blow, methought the poor designed
victim jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick
grove before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies,
when perceiving that the others did rjot follow him that
way, I appeared to him ; that he humbly kneeled down,
before me, seeming to pray for my assistance; upon
which I snowed him my ladder, made him ascend, carri-
ed him to my cave, and he became my servant; and when
I had gotten this man, I said to myself, now surely I may
have some hopes to attain the main land; for this fellow
will serve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I
must go for provisions, what places to shun, what to ven-
ture to, and what to escape. But when I awaked, and
found all these inexpressible impressions of joy entirely
vanished, I fell into the greatest dejection of spirit ima-
ginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect that one sure
way of escaping was to get a savage; that after I had ven-
tured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws of his
devourers, the natural sense he might have of such a pre-
servation, might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and
most sincere affection. But then this objection reasonably
interposed,how can left'ect this, thought I, without I attack
a whole company of them, and kill them all ? why should
I proceed on such a desperate attempt, which my scru-
ples before had suggested to be unlawful? and indeed my
heart trembled at the thoughts of so much blood, though
it were a means to procure my deliverance. 'Tis true, I
might reasonably enough suppose these men to be real
enemies to my life, men who would devour me, was it in
their power ; sot hat it was self-preservation in the high-
est degree to free myself, by attacking them in my own
defence as lawfully as if they were actually assaulting me:
though all these things, I say, seemed to me to be of the
greatest weight, yet as I just said before, the dreadful
thoughts of shedding human blood, struck such n terror
to my soul, that it was a long time before I could recon-
cile myself to it.
But how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on?
for notwithstanding the many disputes and perplexities I
had with myself, I at length resolved, right or wrong, to
get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it
would, or even though I should lose my life in the attempt.
Inspired with this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work
to find out what methods I should take to answer my de-
sign : this indeed was so difficult a task, that I could not
pitch upon any probable means to execute it, I therefore,
resolved continually to be in a vigilantposture, to perceive
when the savages came on shore, and to leave the rest to
the event, let the opportunities offer as they would.
Such was my fixed resolution ; and accordingly set my-
self upon the scout, as often as I could, till such time as I
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year and a
half, the greatest part of which I went out to the west and
south-west-corner of the island, almost every day, to look
for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great dis-
couragement ; yet though I was very much concerned,
the edge of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer
it seemed to be delayed, the more eager was I for it ; in a
word I never before was so careful to shun the loathing
sight of these savages, as I now was eager to be with them
and I thought myself sufficiently able to manage one, two
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them my
entire slaves, to tio whatsoever I should direct them, and
prevent their being able at any time to do me a mischief.
Many times did I use to please myself with these thoughts,
with long and ardent expectations ; but nothing present-
ing all my deep projected schemes and numerous fancies
vanished away, as though, while I retained such thoughts,
the decree of Providence was such, that no savages were
to come near me.
H
About a year and a half after, when I was seriously mu-
sing of sundry other ways how I should attain my end, one
•morning early I was very much surprised by seeingnoless
than five canoes all on shore together, on my side the is-
land, and the savages that belonged to them all landed, and.
out of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all
my measures 3 for seeing so many boats, each of which
would contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell
•what to think of it,or how to order my measures, to attack
twenty or thirty men single handed; upon which much
dispirited and perplexed, I lay still in my castle; which,
however, I put in a proper posture for an attack, and hav-
ing formerly provided all that was necessary, was soon
ready to enter upon an engagement, should they attempt.
Having waited for some time, my impatient temper would
let me bear it no longer ; I set my guns at the foot of my
ladder and as usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at
two stages, standing however, in such a manner, that my
head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not
easily perceive me ; and here, by the assistance of my per-
spective glass, I observed no less than thirty in number
around a fire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed,
how they cooked it, or what it was, I could not then per-
fectly tell ; but they were all dancing and capering about
the flames, using many frightful and barbarous gestures,
lint while with a curious eye, I was beholding these
wretches, my spirit sunk within me, when I perceived
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done
before.
It was not long before one of them fell upon the ground
knocked down as I supposed with a club or wooden sword
for that was their manner; while two or three others
went immediately to 'rork, cutting him open for their
eookery, and then fell to devour him as they had done the
former, while the last unhappy captive was left by himself
till such time as they wereready for him. Thepoor crea-
ture looked round with a wishful eye, trembling at the
thoughts of death ; yet seeing himself a little at liberty
nature, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with
hopes of life ; he started away from them, and ran with
incredible swiftness along the sands, directly to that part
of the coast where my ancient and venerable castle stood.
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully frightened up-
on this occasion, when as I thought, they pursued him in
a whole body, all running towards my palace. And nowr
indeed, I excepted that part of my dream was going to be
fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove for
protection ; but for the rest of my dream, I could depend
nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him thither,
and find him there. However, my spirits beginning to re-
cover, I still kept upon my guard ; and I now plainly per-
ceived there were but three men out of the number that
pursued him. I was infinitely pleased with what swiftness
the poor creature ran from his pursuers gaining so much
ground upon them, that I plainly perceived, could he thus
hold out for half an hour, there was not the least doubt but
he would save his life from the power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a creek, that
very same which I sailed into with all my effects from the
•wreck of the ship, on the steep banks of which I very much
feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could not swim
for his escape : But soon was I out of pain for him, when
I perceived he made nothing of it, though at full tide, but
•with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the sense of dan-
ger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over in about
thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the same incre-
dible strength and swiftness as before. When the three
pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I perceived
could not swim, happily for his part, returned to his com-
pany, while the others, with equal courage, but much less
swiftness, attained the other side, as though they were re-
solved never to give over the pursuit.
And now or never I thought Was the time for me to pro.
cure me a servant, companion, or assistant; and that I
was decreed by Providence to be the instrument to save
this poor creature's life. I immediately descended my two
ladders with the greatest expedition ; I took up my two
guns which I said before, were at the bottom of them, and
getting up again with the same haste towards the hill, I
made nearer the sea: in a word, taking a short cut down
the hill, I interposed between the pursuers and pursued,
hallooing aloud to the latter, who venturing to look back,
Vas no doubt as much terrified at me as I at him. I beck-
oned to him with my hand, to return back, in the mean-
time advancing towards the pursuers, and rushing on the
foremost, I knocked him down with the stock ol my piece,
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to
fire lest the rest should hear, though at a distance, I
questioned whether they could or no, and being out of
sight of the smoke, they could not easily have known what
to make of it. The other savage seeing his fellow full,
stopped as if he had been amazed ; when advancing to-
wards him, I could perceive him take his bow from his
hack, and fixing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at
me, and without dispute, might have lodged the arrow in
my breast; but, in this absolutely necessary case of self-
preservation, I immediately fired at him, and shot him
dead, just as his hand was going to draw the fatal string.
All this while, the savage who had fled before stood still,
and had the satisfaction to see his enemies killed, as he
thought, who designed to take away his life; so affrighted
was he with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
as it were like Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without
either sense or motion. This obliged me to halloo to
him again, making the plainest signs I could to him to
draw nearer. I perceived he understood those tokens by
his approaching to me a liltle way, when, as if afraid I
should kill him too, he stopped again. Several times did
he advanee, and as often stop in this manner, till coming
more to my view, I perceived him trembling, as if he was to
undergo the same fate. Upon which I looked upon him
with a smiling countenance, and still beckoning to him, at
length he came close to me and kneeled down, kissed the
ground, laid his head upoii it, and taking me by the foot
set it on his head; and this, as I understood afterwards,
was a token of swearing to be my slavfe forever. I took him,
up, and making much of him, encouraged him in the best
manner I could. But my work was not yet finished, for I
perceived the savage whom I knocked down, was not killed
but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself.
Upon which I pointed to my new servant, and showed him
that his enemy was not yet expired, he spoke some words
to me, but which I could not understand; yet being the
first sound of a man's voice I had heard for above twenty-
five years, they were very pleasing to me. But there was
no time for reflection now, the wounded savage recovering
himself so far as to sit upon the ground, which made my
poor prisoner as much afraid as before ; to put him out of
•which fear, I presented my other gun at the man, with an
intent to shoot him; but my savage, for so I must now

call him, prevented my firing, by making a motion to
me, to lend him my sword, which hung naked in my belt
by my side
No sooner did I grant his request, but away he runs to'
his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head as desirously
as the most accomplished executioner in Germany could
have done, for it seems these creatures make use of wood-
en swords madeof hard wood which will bear edge enough
to cut offheads and arms at one blow. When this valo-
rous exploit was done, he comes to me laughing, as a
token of triumph, delivered me my sword again, with
abundance of surprising gestures, laying it along with the
bleeding and ghastly head of the Indian, at my feet •>
The greatest astonishment that my new servant con-
ceived was the manner of killing the savage at such a dis-
tance without a bow and a'rrow ; and such was his longing
desire to know it, that he first pointed to the dead carcase
and then made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him.
Upon which 1 bid him go, and as well as I could, made
him sensible 1 -granted his request. But when he came
there, how wonderfully was he strugk with amazement I
First he turned him on one side, then on another, won-
dering he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding
inwardly ; and after .sufficiently admiring the wound the
bullet had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar-
rows, and came back again, upon which I turned to go•
•
away, making my signs to him to follow, lest the rest mis-
sing their companions, might come in pursuit of them,
and this I found he understood very well, by his making
me understand that his design was to bury them, that they
might not be seen if it happened ; and which by signs I
again made him sensible 1 very much approved of. He
immediately fell to work, and never was any grave-digger
more dextrous in the world than he was, for in an in-
stant, as I might say, he ss raped a.large hole in the sand
with his bands, sufficient to bury the first in; there he
dragged him, and without any ceremony he covered him
over ; in like manner he served the other ; so that I am
sure no undertaker could be more expert in his business;
for all this was done in less than a quarter of an hour. I
then called him away, and instead of carrying him direct*
]y to my castle at first, i conveyed him to my cave on the
farther part «f the island ; and so my dream was now fulr-

H2
filled in that particular, that my grove should prove an
asylum or sanctuary to him.
Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must
this poor creature he, supported chiefly by the vivacity
of spirit and uncommon transports of joy that his deliver-
ance occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of
raisins to eat, and water to drink, on which lie fed very
cheerfully, to his exceeding refreshment. I then made
him a convenient bed with a parcel of rice straw, .and a
blanket upon it (a bed which I used myself sometimes)
and then pointing to it, made signs for him to lie down to
slfep. upon which the poor creature went to take a wel-
come repose.
Indeed he was a very comely handsome, young fellow,
extremely well made, with strait long limbs, not too large
but tall and well shaped, and as near as I could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His countenance had no-
thing in it tierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in
his face ; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all
the sweetness and softness of an European His hair was
not curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long
and black, with the most beautiful, yet careless tresses
spreading over his shoulders. He had a very high and
Jarge forehead, with a great vivacity and sparkling sharp-
ness in his eyes. His skin was not so tawny as the Vir-
ginians, Brazilians, or other Americans ; but rather of a
bright dun, olive colour, that had something agreeable in
it, though not very easy to give a description of. His face
was round and plump, with a small nose, very different
from the flatness of the negroes,a pretty small mouth, thin
Hps, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the driven
snow. In a word, such handsome features and exact sym-
metry in every part, made me consider that I had saved
the life of an Indian prince, no less graceful and accom-
plished than the great Oroonoko, whose memorable beha-
vior and unhappy contingencies of life had charmed the
world, both to admiration of his person, and compassion
to his sufferings.
But let him be cither prince or peasant, all my happi-
ness centered in this, that I had now got a good servant
or companion, to whom as he deserved, I was resolved to
prove a kind master and a lasting friend. He had not slept
above an hour, when he awaked again, and while I was
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave to-
wards me in my enclosure and laying himself down on
the ground, in the lowest prostration, made all the antic
gestures imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me for
being his deliverer. Though the manner of his behaviour
seemed to be ludicrous enough to excite laughter, yet I
was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart
melted within me, fearing he might die away in excess of
joy, like reprieved malefactors ; especially as it was out of
my power either to let him blood, or to administer physic.
It were to be wished, that Christians would take example
by this Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance of the
benefits and deliverances they have received by the kind
mediation and pow«rful interposition of their benefactors
and deliverers ; and it would be likewise happy for man-
kind, were there no occasion to blame many, who instead
of thankfully acknowledging favours and benefits, rather
abuse and condemn those who have been the instruments
to save them from destruction. e
But leaving these just reflections, I return to the object
which occasioned them ; for my man, to conclude the last
ceremony of obedience, laid down his head again on the
ground, close to my foot, and set my other foot upon his
head as he had done before, milking all the signs of sub-
mission, servitude and subjection imaginable, and let me
understand he would serve me as long as his life endured.
As I understood him in many things I made him sensible
I was very well pleased with him ; and in a little time, I
began to speak to him, and learn him to talk to me again.
In the first place I made him understand his name was
to be Friday, because it was upon that day I saved his life;
then I taught him to say Master, which I made him sen-
sible was to be my name. I likewise taught him to say
Yes and No, and to know what they meant. I gave him
some milk in an earthen pot, making him view me while
I drank it before him, and soaked my bread in it ; 1 gave
him a cake of bread, and caused him to soak it likewise,
to which he readily consented, making signs of the great-
est satisfaction imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there ; but no sooner did
the morning light appear, when J ordered him to arise,
and come along with me, with certain tokens that I would
give him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed ve-
ry glad, being start naked, without the least covering
whatever. As we passed by the place where the two men
had been interred, my man pointed directly to their graves
showing me the marks that he had made to find them
again,giving me to understand that we should dig them up
and devour them. At this I appeared extremely displeas-
ed, expressed my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit
at the apprehensions of it, beckoning with my hand to
come away, which he did with the greatest reverence
and submission. After this I conducted him to the top of
the hill, to view if the rest of the savages were yet .remain-
ing there ; but when I looked through my perspective
glass, I could see no appearance of them, nor of their
canoes ; so that it was very evident they never minded
their deceased companions whom we had slain, which,
if they had, they would surely have searched for, or left
one boat behind for them to follow, after they returned
from their pursuit.
Curiosity,and a desire of satisfaction, animating me with
courage to see this scene of barbarity. I took my man
Friday with me, putting a sword into his hand, with the
bow and arrows at his back, which I perceived he couid
use very dextrously, causing him to carry one gun for me
and I two for myself; and thus equipped against all at-
tacks, away we marched directly to the place of their
bloody entertainment. But when I came there, I was
strurk w:th the utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle,
whilst Friday was no ways concerned about it, being no
doubt in his turn one of those devourers. Here lay se-
veral humaft bones, there several pieces of mangled fle^h
half eaten, mangled and scorched, while streams of blood
ran promiscuously as waters from a fountain. As 1 was
musing on this dreadful sight, Friday took all the pains he
could, by particular signs, to make me understand, that
they had brought over four prisoners to feast upon, three
of whom they had eaten up, and that he was the fourth,
pointing to himself; that there having been a bloody bat-
tle between them and his great king in the just detence
of whom he was taken prisoner, with many others , all
cf these were carried off to different places, to be de-
poured by their conquerors ; and that it was his misfor-
tune to be brought hither by these wretches for the same
purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I caused
Friday to gather those horrid remains, and lay tnem to-
gether upon a heap, which I ordered to be set on fire,
and burnt them to ashes : my roan however still retained
the nature of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach af-
ter some of the flesh ; but such an extreme abhorrence
did I express at the least appearance of it, that he durst
not but conceal it; for I made him very sensible, that it*
in future, he offered any such thing, I would certainly
shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my cas-
tle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had
taken out of the poor gunner's chest before mentioned;
and which with a little alteration fitted him very well:
in the next place I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, such
as my skill was able to manage, and indeed I thought my-
self then a tolerable good tailor. I also gave him a cap
which was made of a hare's skin, very convenient and
fashionable. Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man
was no less proud of his habit, than I was in seeing him
in it. Indeed he went very awkwardly about at first, the
drawers being two heavy on his thighs, not used to bear
any weight, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders and the inside of his arms ; but by a little eas-
ing where he complained they hurt him, and by using
himself to them, at length he took to them very well.
My next concern was where I should lodge him ; and
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy
myself, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place be-
tween my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and
outside of the first; and as there was an entrance, or door
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a
door to open on the inside ; I barred it up in the night-
time taking in my ladders too, so that was my man to
prove treacherous, there could be no way to come at me
in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me;
Jbr my first wall had now a complete roof over it, of long
poles spreading over my tent, and leaning up to the side
of the mountain, which was again laid cross with smaller
sticks instead of laths,and thatched over a great thickness
with the rice straw, which was as strong as reeds; and
at the hole of the place left on purpose to go in or out by
the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap door, which if it
had been attempted on the out side, would nothave open-
ed at all, but have fallen down, and made a great noise;
and as to my weapons, every night I took them all to my
bedside.
But there was no occasion for this precaution; for surely
never master had a more sincere, faithful and loving ser-
vant,than Friday proved to me: without passion,sullenness
or design, perfectly obliging and engagmg, his affections
were as much tied to me,as those of a child to its parents;
and I might venture to say, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving of mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
And indeed the many testimonies he gave me of this suf-
ficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use these
precautions. And here I could not but reflect with great
wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty in his
providence, and in the government of the creation, to take
from so great apart of the world of his creatures, the no-
blest uses to which their faculties, and the powers o!'their
souls are adapted ; yet that he has bestowed upon them
the same reason, affections, sentimCnts of kindiiess and
obligation, passions and resentment, sincerity, fidelity, and
all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he has
given us; and that when he is graciously pleased to offer
them occasions of exerting these, they areas ready, nay,
more ready to apply them to the proper uses for which
they were bestowed, than we often are. These thoughts
•would make me melancholy, especially when 1 considered
how mean a use we make of all these, even though we
have these powers enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God,
and by the knowledge of this world, as an addition to our
understanding ; and why it has pleased the heavenly wis-
dom to conceal the like saving knowledge from so many
millions of souls, who would certainly make a much bet-
teruseof it than generally mankind do at this time. These ,
reflections would sometimes lead me so far, as to invade
the sovereignty of Providence, and as it were arraign the
justice of such an arbitrary disposition of things, that ob-
scures that light from some, and yet expects a like duty
From all. But I closed it up, checking my thoughts with
this conclusion : first, That we were ignorant of that right
and law by which those should be condemned ; but as the
Almighty was necessarily and by the nature of his essence
infinitely just and holy ; so it could not be otherwise, but
that if these creatures were all destined to absence from
himself, it was on account of sinning against that light
which, as the Scriptures says, was a law to themselves,
^nd by such rules as their censciences would ackiwvledge
to be just, though the first foundation was not discovered to
«s. And secondly, that still as we were the clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, " Why
"hast thou fashioned me after this manner?"
I had not been above two or three days returned to my
castle, but my chief design was, howl should bring Friday
off from this horrid way of feeding, and to take from him.
that inhuman relish he by nature had beenaccusUflhed to,
I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which
might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so
often expressed against their accursed way of living. Up-
on which, one morning I took him out with me, with an
intention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home,
and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying
down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Im-
mediately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding
him stand still, and not stir, I presented my piece, and
shot one of the kids. My poor servant, who had at a dis-
tance perceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not
know by what means, or how it was done, stood trembling
and surprised, and looked so amazed, that I thought he
would have sunk into the earth. He did not see the kid I
aimed at, or behold I had killed it, but ripped up his waist-
coat to see if he was not wounded, thinking my resolution
was to kill him : for coming to me, he fell on his knees,
earnestly pronouncing many things which •! did not under-
stand the meaning of ; which at length I perceived was,
that I would not take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to see him in that condi-
tion, where nature is upon the severest trial, when the
immediate hand of death is ready to put forever a period
to this mortal life ; and indeed so much compassion had I
to this creature,that it was with difficulty I refrained from
tears. But however, as another sort of countenance was
necessary, and to convince him that I would do him no
harm, I took him smiling by the hand, then laughed at
him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain, made signs
to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less cu-
rious was he in viewing how the creature was killed, than
he had been before in beholding the Indian; which, while
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and pre-
sently perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching upon
a tree within shot; and therefore, to let Friday understand
whai I was going to dp, I called him to me Again, point-
ing at the fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made
him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird ; ac-
cordingly I fired, and bade him look, when immediately
he saw the parrot fall down. Again he stood like one
amazed, notwithstanding all I had said to him : and the
more confounded he was, because he did not perceive me
put any thing into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing so ut-
terly stftmge, carrying death along with it, far or near, ei-
ther to man or beast, must certainly create the greatest
astonishment to one who never had heard such a thing in
his whole life ; and really his amazement continued so
long, that had I allowed it, he would have prostrated him-
self before me and my gun, with the greatest worship and
adoration. As for my gun in particular, he would not so
much as touch it for several days after, but would come and
communicate his thoughts t6 it, and talk to it, as if the
senseless piece had understood and answered him, all this
I could perceive him do, when he thought my back was
turned, the chief intent of which was, to desire it not to
kill him, as I afterwards came to understand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions;
but when his astonishment was a little over, I made tokens
to him to run, and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which
accordingly he did, staying some time longer than usual,
by reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some
way further from the place where she fell: in the mean
time, as he was looking for her, I took the advantage of
charging my gun again, that so I might be ready for any
other mark that offered; but nothing more occurred at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening
took off the skin,and divided the carcase as well as Icould.
Part of the flesh I stewed and boiled in a pot I had for this
purpose. And then spreading my table,I sat down, giv-
ing my man some of it to eat,who was wonderfully pleas-
ed, and seemed to like it very well: but what was the
most surprising to him was to see me eat salt with it:up-
on which he made me understand, that the salt was very
bad for me ; when putting a little into his mouth,he seem-
ed to nauseate it in such a manner, as to spit and sputter
at it, and then washed his mouth with fresh water: but to
show him how contrary his-opinion wasto mine, I put some
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and
sputter as much for the want of it«s he Had done at it;
yet all this proved of no signification to Friday; «od it was
ti long while before he could endure salt in his meat of
broth, and even then but a small quantity.
Thus having; fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast
him with a roasted piece of the kid. And having no spit
to fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of that common
artifice which many of the common people of England
have, that is to set two poles upon each side of the fire, and
one cross on the top, hanging the meat thereon with a
string, and so turning round continually, roast it, in the
same manner as we read bloody tyrants of old cruelly roast-
ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admira-
tion in my man Friday, being quite another \vay than that
to which the savages were accustomed. But when he came
to taste the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he ex-
pressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand different
ways : and as I could net but understand his meaning, you
, may be sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when
lie made it also very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my servant to work;
So next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in
the same manner as I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the execution of any
thing I ordered him to go about. I made him understand
that it was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let
him see me make it; in short, he did every thing as I or-
dered him, and in a little time as well as 1 could perform,
it myself.
But now considering that I had two mouths to feed in-
stead o'f one, it was necessary that I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than common ; upon which I marked out a larger piece
of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as I had done
before ; in the execution of which I must give Friday this
good word, that no man could work more hardy, or with
a better will than he did ; and when I made him sensible
that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he then
very passionately made me understand, that he thought
I had much more labour on his account, than for myself;
and that no pains or diligence should be wanting in him,
if 1 v ould but direct hijn in those work* wherein he might
proceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most plcasuir
year I ever had m the island ; for after some time, Friday
began totalkpretty welt, and understood the names of those
things which I was wont to call for, and the places where
I used to send htm. So that my long silent tongue, which
had been useless so many years, except in an exclamatory
manner, either for deliverance or blessings, now began to
be occupied in teaching, and talking to my man Friday;
for indeed 1 had such a singular satisfaction in the fellow
himself, so innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty
appear more and more to me every day,that I really began
entirely to love him ; and for his part, I believe there was
no love lost, and that his nature had been more charmed
by his exceeding kindness, and his affections more placed
upon me, than any other object whatsoever among his own
countrymen I once had a great mind to try if ke had any
hankering inclination to his own country again; and by
this time having learned the English so well, that he
could give me tolerable answers to any question which I
demanded I asked him whether that nation to which he
belonged, ever conquered in battle ? This question made
Friday to smile, and to which he answered," Yes, yes, we
"always fight the better ;" as much as to say, they always
•got the better in the fight. Upon which we proceeded on
the following discourse : You say, said I, that you always
fight the better ; why then, Friday, how came you to be
taken prisoner?
Friday. But for all that my nation beat much. ,
Master. How say you, beat I if your nation beat their),
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They many more mans than my nation in the
place where me was ; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three
great tousand.
Master. Then why did not your men recover you from
the hands of your enemies?
, Friday. They run one, two, o,r three, and me; they
make all go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that
time.
Master. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your
nation do with the prisoners they take ? Do they carry
them away and eat them as these have done?
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up alJ.
Master. To what place do they carry them to be de-
voured?
Friday. Go to other nations where lhcy think.
Master. Do they bring them hither?
2friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place,
Master. And have you been with them here, Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (fioiniing to the nortA-wett
of the island, being the side where they used to land.)
Thus having gotten what account I could from my man,
I plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the
vest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the sa-
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of
the island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was
brought hither for ; and some time after I carried him to
that place where he pointed, and no sooner did he come
there, but he presently knew the ground, signifying to me
that he was once there when they ate up twenty men, two
women and a young child; but as he could not explain the
number in English, he did it by so many stones m a row,
making a sign to me to count them.
This passage I have the rather mentioned, because it
led to things more important and useful for me to know;
fer after I had this satisfactory discourse with him, my
next question was, how far it was from the island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost in the -
ocean? to which he answered there was no danger ; that
no canoes were ever lost: but that after a little way out
to the sea, there was a strong current, and a wind always
one way in the afternoon. This I thought at first to be no
more than the sets of the tide, of going out, or coming
in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the
great draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko,
in the mouih or gulph of which I imagined my kingdom
lay ; and that the land which I perceived to the W. and
N. W. must be the great island Trinidad, on the north
of the river. A thousand questions (if that would satisfy
me) did 1 ask Friday about the nature of the country, the
sea, the coast, the inhabitants, and what nations were
nearest them ; to which questions the poor fellow declared
all he knew, with the greatest openness and utmost sin-
cerity. When 1 demanded of him the particular names
of the various nations of his sort of people, he could only
answer me in general, that they were called Carabee.
Hence it was that I considered they must be the Carib-
bees, so much taken notice of by our maps, to be on that
part of America which reaches from the mouth of the ri*
ver Oroonokoto Guiana, and soup to St. Mariha. Then
Friday proceeded to tell me that up a great way beyond
the moon, as much as to say beyond the setting of the
mooB, which must be west from their country, there
dwelt white bearded men, such as I was, pointing to my
whiskers, and that they kill much mans. I was not igno-
rant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated these criea-.
tures; so that I presently concluded it must be them,
•whose cruelties had spread so much throughout the con-
tinent of America, as to be remembered even to succeed-
ing generations. <
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge, which the im-
perfect knowledge of my man had led me to, was .very
comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him
how I might depart from this island, and get among those
-.vhite men? 'He told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two
"canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean I surely he means one for himself, and another for.
me ; and if not, how must two canoes hold me without
being joined, or one part of my body being put into one,;
and another in another ? and indeed it was a long timef
before I understood his meaning, which was, that it must,
be a large boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with
the waves, and not so liable to be overwhelmed with thcni'
as a small one must be,. . .
I believe there is no state of life but what may be hap-
py, if people would but endeavour for their part to majle
it so. tie is not the happiest man that has the most riehes.
But he that is content with what he hath. Before I had
iny servant, I thought myself miserable till I had him;
and now that I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I
still complained, and begged a deliverance from a place of
retirement, ease and plenty, where Providence had suffi-
ciently blessed me. In a word from this time I entertain-
ed some hopes that one time or other I might find an op-
portunity to make my escape from this island, and that
this poor savage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All the time since my man became so intelligent as to
understand and speak to me, I spared no pains or dili-
gence to instruct him, according to my poor share of
knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the adoration
that he ought to pay to the True God. One time as I
very well remember, I asked him who made him? At
first the innocent creature did not understand what I
meant, but rather thought I asked him who was his fa-
ther ?upon which I took another way to make him sen-
sible, by demanding from him an answer to this question.
Friday, said I, who is it that made the sea, this ground
whereon we walk, and all these bills and woods which we
behold? And here indeed I did not miss my intention;
for he told me it was old Benamuckee (the God whom I
supposed these savages adored) wh,o lived a great way be-
yond all. But as to his attributes, poor Friday was an ut-
ter stranger. He could describe nothing of this great per-
son ; and all that he could say was that he was very old),
much older than the sea and' land, the moon, or the stars.
Friday, said I again, if this great and old person has made
all things in the world, how comes it to pass that all things
as you in particular, do not adore and worship him ? upon
this looking very grave, with a perfect sweet look of inno-
cence he replied, " Master, all things say O! to him,"
by which it may reasonably be supposed he meant adora-
tion. And where, said I, do the people of your country
go when they die? H« answered to Btnamuckee. What,
and those people that are eaten up, do they go there?
"Benamuckee," said he, " love 'em dearly ; me pray to
"Benamuckee in the canoe, and Benamuckee would love*
a me when dey eat me all up."
Such discourses as these I had with my man, and such
made me sensible, that the true God is- worshipped tho'
under imperfect similitudes ;. and that the false adoration
which the heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as-
great an argument of the divine essence, as the most
learned Atheists falsely so called) can bring against it;
for God will be glorified in his works, let their denomina-
tion be what it will ; and I cannot be of that opinion
which-some conceive,that God should decree men to be
damned for want of a right notion of faith in a place
where the wisdom cf the Almighty has not permitted it
to he preached ; and therefore cannot but conclude, that
since obedience is the best sacrifice, these poor creatures,
acting by that light and knowledge which they are possess-
ed of, may undoubtedly obtain a happy salvation, though;
not that enjoyment with Christ, as his saints, confessors^
ami martyrs rousi enjoy.

•
But laying these determinations aside, more fit for di-
vines than me vo discuss, I began to instruct my servant iit
the saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the di-
rections of God's Holy Spirit assisted me. I lifted up my
hands to heaven, and pointing thereto, told him that the
Great Maker of Heaven and earth lived there; that as
his infinite power fashioned this world out of a confused
chaos, and made it in that beautiful frame which we be-
hold, so he governs and preserves it by his unbounded
knowledge, sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence;
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give
every thing to us, and take every thing away from us;
that he was a rewarder and punisher of good and evil ac-?
tions; that there was nothing but what he knew, no
thoughts so secret but what he could brmg to light; and
thus by degrees, I opened his eyes, and described to him
the manner of the creation of the world, the situation of
Paradise, the transgression of our first parents, the wick-
edness of God's peculiar people, and the universal sins
and abominations of the whole earth. When these things
tvere implanted in his mind, I told him that as God's jus-
tice was equal to his mercy, he resolved to destroy this
. world, lill his Son, Jesus Christ interposed in our behalf;
and to procure our redemption, obtained leave of his hea-
venly father to come down from heaven, into the world,
•where he took human nature upon him, instructed us in
our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins;
that he was now ascended into heaven, mediating for our
pardon, delivering our petitions, and obtaining all those
good benefits which we ask in his name, by humble and
hearty prayers, all which were heard at the throne of
Heaven. As very frequently I used to inculcate things
into his mind, Friday one day told me that if our great
God could hear us beyond the sun, he must surely be a
greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little
way off, and yet could not hear them till they ascended
the great mountains where he lived, to speak to him-
What, said I, Friday, did you go thither to speak to him
too ? he answered, " No, they never went that were
"young men,none but old men, called their Oowakakee,"
meaning the Indian priests," who went to say O!" and
thus he called their prayers, " they returned back, and
'' told them what Benamuckee said." From hence I could
not bui observe how happy we Christians are, who have
God's immediate revelation for our certain guide • and
that our faith is neither misled, nor our reason imposed
on, by any set of men, similar to these Indian importers
But to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday'
I told him, that the pretence of their ancient men goine
up to the mountam to say O! to their God Benamuckee
was an imposture, and that their bringing back an answer
was all a sham, if not worse; for that if there was any
such thmg spoken to them, it must doubtless proceed
from an mfernal spirit. And here I thought it necessary
to enter mto a long discourse with him, which I did after
this manner.
Friday, said I, you must know, that before this world
was made, there was an Almighty power existing bv
whose power all things were made, and whose Majesty
shall have no end. To be glorified and adored by beines
of a heavenly nature, he created angels and archangels
that is glorified spirits, resembling himself, to encompass
his throne, eternally singing forth his praise in the most
heavenly sounds and divine harmony And among this
heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a great sway, as then beintr
one ot the peculiar favorites of these celestial abodes • but
he, contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign
with unbounded ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not on.'
ly envied him that adoration which was his due but
thought to usurp that throne which he had neither power
to keep nor title to pretend to He raised a dissemion and-
civil war m heaven, and had a number of angels to take
his part. Unbounded folly! stupendous pride! to hope
lor victory, and aspire above his powerful Creator! l'he
Deity, not fearful of such an enemy, yet justly provoked
at this rebellion, commissioned his archangel Michael to
lead forth the heavenly host, and give him battle; the ad
vantage of which was quickly perceived, by Satan's beine
overthrown, and the prince of the air, for so the devil is
called, with all his fallen angels, driven headlonc into a
dismal place, which is called Hell °
The recital of this truth made my man give the ereat-
est attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction by his
gestures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole.
And then I desired him to give great heed to what I had
further to say. , ,
No sooner, p-oceeded 1, was God freed from, and the'
n clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speajis to
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, an'I
were equal to him in power and glory, Come let ut make
man, said he,ira our own image, after our ov>n ttlceness^Gen.
i. 26. to have dominion over the creatures of the world
•which we have created. And these he intended should
glorify him in Heaven, according to their obedience in this
state of probation on earth, which was, as it were, to be the
school to train them up for these heavenly mansions.
Now Satan seeing himself foiled; yet that God had taken
the power from him as prince of the air, which power
Heaven designed he should retain, whereby his creatures
might be tried ; in revenge for the disgrace he had receiv-
ed, he tempts Adam's wife, Eve, to taste of the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, which God had forbidden He
appears to her in the shape of a serpent, then a most
beautiful creature, and tells her that it was no better than
an imposition, which God had put upon' her and her hus-
band, not to eat of that fair fruit whicft he had created }
that the taste thereof would make them immortal like
God himself; and consequently as great and powerful as
he. Upon which she not only eat thereof herself, but
made her husband eat also, which laid them both under
the heavenly displeasure.
Here Friday expressed a great concern: "Ah, poor
"mans!" cried he, "naughty womans! naughty devil!
"make God not love de mans, make mans like devil
« himself."
Friday, said I, God still loved mankind, and though the
devil tempted human nature so faiv he would not sufler
him to have an absolute power over them. I have told you
before of his tender love to his people, till they, like Luci-
fer, disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him;
and even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save
sinners. But still every man that lives in the world is un-
der temptation and trial. The devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in
our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have pro-
ceed from him; so that God, in this our distress, expects
we should apply ourselves to him hy fervent prayer for
apeedy redress. He is not like Benamuckee, to let none
come near him but Oowakakee, but suffers the people as
•well as priests to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to
be delivered from the power and temptation of the devil;
; But though at first my man Friday expressed some con-
cern at the wickedness of Lucifer, I found it not so easy
to imprint th* right notions of him in his mind, as it was
about the divine essence of God ; for there nature assist-
ed me in all my arguments, to show to him plainly the
necessity of a great first cause, and over-ruling, governing
power, of a secret directing Providence, and of the equity
and reasonableness of paying adoration to our Creator;
whereas there appeared nothing of all this in the notion
cf an evil spirit, of his first beginning) his nature, and
above all, of his inclination to evil actions, and his power to
tempt us to the like. And indeed this unlearned Indian^
by the mere force of nature, puzzled me with one parti-
cular question, more than ever I could have expected.
I had, it seems one day, been talking to him of th»
omnipotent power of God, and his infinite abhorrence of
sin, in so much that the Scriptures styled him a consuming
fire to all the workers of iniquity ; and that it was in hi*
power, whenever he pleased, to destroy all the world in a
moment, the greater part of which are continually offend-
ing him.
- When, with a serious attention, he had listened a great
while to what I said, after telling him how the devil was
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice
.and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and des-
troy the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so forth:
"Very well. Master, " said Friday, " yo\i say God is so
"strong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier
"than the naughty devil ?" To be sure, Friday said I, God
is more wise and stronger than the serpent : he is above
the devil, which makes us pray to him, that he would treacV-
down Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. "Why then,"
answered Friday quickly," if God, as you say, has much
"strong, much might as the devil, why God no kill devil,
"niake no more tempt, no more do wicked."
You may be certain, I was strangly surprised at this
question of my man's : and though an old man, 1 was but a
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified tor a ca-
suist, or a revolver of intricate doubts in religion ; and as it
required some time for me to study an answer, I pretend*
«tl not to heat- him, nor to ask him what he said; but so
earnest was he for an answer, as not to forgei his question,
which he repeated in the very same broken words as above'.
When I had recovered myself a little, Friday, said I, God
will at last punish him severely; being reserved for judg-
ment,, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to remain
in fire everlasting. But all this didnot satisfy Friday ; for,
returning upon me, he repeated my words, "RESERVE AT
"LAST, me no understand ; but why not kill devil now,
"not kill devil, great, great while ago ;" Friday, said 1,
you may as well ask me why God does not kill you and me,
when by our wicked actions, weso much ofiendhis divine
Majesty ? He gives us time to repent of our sins, that
thereby we may obtain pardon. At these words obtain
pardon, Friday mused a great while : and at last, looking
me stedfastly in the face, "Well, well," said be, " that's
"very well ; so you, I, devil, all wkked mans, all pre-
"serve, repent, God pardon all."
Indeed, here I wasrundown tothe last extremity, when
it became very evident to me, how mere natural notions
will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge oia De-
ity, and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God';
but however, nothing but divine revelation can form the
knowledge of JesusChrist, and of a redemption purchased
for us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an in-
tercessor at the footstool of God's throne, and therefore,
the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ; that is
the word and Spirit of God, promised for the guide and
sanctifier of his people, are the most necessary instructors
of the souls of men, in the saving knowledge of the Al-
mighty, and the means to attain eternal happiness.
And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis-
course between my man and me; for which purpose I rose
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go out,
sending Friday for something that was a good way off. I
then fell on my knees, and beseeched God that he would
inspire me so tar as to guide this poor savage in the know-
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly that
his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and
his soul saved. When he returned again, I entered intoa
very long discourse with him.on the subject of the world's
redemption by the Saviour of it,and the doctrine of repen-
tance preached from Heaven, together with an holy faith
of our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then proceed-
ed to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the
reason why our Saviour took not on him the nature of an-
gels, but rather the see* of Abraham.; and how the fallen
angels had no benefit by that redemption; and lastly, that
he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and
the like. God knows I had more sincerity than knowledge
in all the ways I took for the poor Indian's instruction ; and
1 must acknowledge what I believe,every body that acts up-
on the same principle will find, that in laying heavenly
truths open before him, I informed and instructed myself in
•many things that either I didnot know, or had not perfectly
considered before ; so that, however, this poor creature
might be improved by my instructions, certain it is, that
I myself had great reason to be thankful to Providence for
sending him to me. Hia company allayed my grief, and
made my habitation comfortable; and when I reflected that
the solitary life to which I had been so long confined, had
made me to look further towards Heaven, by making me
the instrument under Providence, to save the life, and for
ought I know, the soul of this poor savage, by bringing
him to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret
joy to spread through every part of my soul; and I fre-
quently rejoiced, that ever I was brought to this place,
which I once thought the most miserable part of the world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards conti-
nue, while I abode on the island, and for three years did
my man and I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness.
Indeed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian a,s I;
and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents
as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the
right way, as much as if we had been on the English
shore.
By the constant application I made to the Scriptures,as
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured
to make him understand every part of it, as much as lay
in my power. He also, on the other hand, by his very se-
rious questions and enquiries, made me a much better pro-
ficient in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by
my own private reading and study. I must not omit ano-
ther thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my re-
tirement. It was that infinite and inexpressible blessing,
the knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was so
plain and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct
me to carry on the great work of sincere repentance for my
sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for eternal lite, to a prac-
tical stated reformation, and obedience to 4tt God's institu-
tions, without the assistance of a reverend and orthodox di-
vine; and especially by this same instruction, so to en-
lighten this savage creature, as to make him so good a
Christian, as very few could exceed him. And there was
only this great thing wanting, that I had no authority to ad-
minister the Holy Sacrament, that heavenly participation
of Christ's body and blood ; yet however, we rested our-
selves content, that God would accept our desires, and ac-
cording to our faith, have mercy on us. -
But what we wanted one way, was made up in another,
and that was universal peace in our little church. We
had no- disputes and wranglings about the nature and
. equality of the holy, blessed and undivided Trinity; no
niceties in doctrine, or schemes of church government;
no sour or morose dissenters to impose more sublimated
notions upon us ; no pedant sophisters to confound us
with unintelligible mysteries : but instead of all this, we
*njoyed the most certain guide to Heaven; that is, the
word of God: besides which, we.had the comfortable views
of his Spirit leading us to the truth, and making us both
.willing and obedient to the instruction of his word. As
the knowledge and practice of this are the principal means
of salvation, I cannot see what it avails any Christian
church, or man in the world, to amuse himself with spe-
culations, and opinions, except it be to display their par-
ticular vanity and affec'.allon. ,
You may well suppose, that by the frequent discourse
we had together, my man and I became most intimately
acquainted, and that there was but very little that I could
say, but what Friday understood ; and indeed, he spoke ve-
ry fluently, though it was but broken English. I now
took a particular pleasure in relating all vny adventures,
especially those that occurred since my being cast on this
island. I made him understand that wonderful mystery,
as he conceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him
how to shoot, I also presented to bim a knife which pleas-
ed him exceedingly, making him a bell with a frog hang-
ing thereto, like those in which we wear hangers in Eng-
land; and instead of a hanger to put in the frog, I ,gave
him a hatchet, which was not only as good, but even a
much better weapon upon many occasions In a word,
my man thus accoutred, looked upon himself as great as
Don Quixotic, when that .celebrated champion went to
combat the windmill•
I next gave him a very particular description of the ter-
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old Eng-
land, the place of my nativity. I had laid before him the
manner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to ano- •
ther, and how we trade in ships to every part of the uni-
verse. 1 then told him my misfortunes in being shipwreck-
ed, showing him, us near as I could, the place where the
ship lay, which had been gone long before; but I brought
him to the ruins of my boat, which before my whole
strength could not move, but now was almost rotten, and
fallen to pieces. I observed my man Friday to view this
boat with an uncommon curiosity; which, when he had
done, he stood pondering a great while, and said nothing.
At last, said I, Friday, what makes you ponder so much?
He replied, " O master, me see like boat come to place at
"my nation."
It was some time, indeed, before 1 understood what my
man meant; but examining strictly into it, I plainly found,
that such another boat resembling mine, had come upon
the country where he dwelt; that is to say, by his farther
explanation, that'the boat was driven there through stress
of weather. It then came into my mind that some Euro-
pean ship having been cast away, the poor distressed crea-
tures were forced to have recourse to the boat to save their
lives; and being all, as I thought, drowned, I never con-
cerned myself to ask any thing concerning them, but my
only enquiry was about the boat, and what description my
man could give of it.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very well, making
every thing very plain to my understanding; but beyond
measure was I satisfied, when he told me with great
warmth and ardour, " O master we save white mans from
"drown;" upon which I immediately asked him if there
were any white mans as he called them, in the boat?
'' Yes, yes," Said he, "the boat full, very full of white
"mans." How many, Friday, said I. Hereupon he num-
dered his fingers, and counted seventeen. And when I
asked him what became of them all, and whether they
]ive«fcor not ? he replied, Yes, master, they all live, they
be live among my nation. This information put fresh
thoughts into my head, that these must be those very
men who before I concluded had been swallowed up in the
ocean, after tltey had left the ship that had struck upon
tlje rocks of my kingdom, and after escaping the fury of
K.
the deep, landed upon the wild shore and committed
themselves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which
consequently, as I thought, must be acted with greater
barbarity to strangers, created in me a greater anxiety,
and made me still more curious to ask Friday concerning
them. He told me he was sure they still lived there, hav-
ing resided among them above four years, and that the
savages gave them victuals to live upon: but pray, Fri-
day, said I, whence proceeded all this good-nature and
generosity? How came it to pass that they did not kill
and eat them, to please their devouring appetites, and oc-
casion so splendid an entertainment among them ? l, No,
"no," said Friday," they not kill 'em, they make brothers
"with 'em ;" by which I understood there was a truce be-
tween them. And then I had a more favorable opinion of
the Indians, upon Friday uttering these words : " My na-
"tion, t'other nation no eat mans, but when mans make
"war fight:" as though he had said that neither those of
his kingdom, nor any other nations that he knew of, ever
ate their fellow creaUires, but such as their law of arms
allowed to be devoured; that is, those miserable captives
whose misfortune it should be to be made captives of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day
in most serene weather, my man and I stood upon the top
of a hill on the east side of the island, whence I had once
before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell
immediately what was the matter; for suddenly Friday
fell a jumping and dancing as if he had been n>ad; and
upon my demanding the reason of his behaviour," O joy,"
said he," O glad, there see my country, there my nation.
"there live white mans gether." And indeed such a rap-
turous sense of pleasure appeared in his countenance, that
his eyes had an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and
such a strange eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to
be in his country again. This made me not so well sa-
tisfied with my man Friday as before; for by this appear-
ance,I made no dispute but that if he could get back again
thither, he would not only be unmindful of what religion
I had taught him, but likewise of the great obligation
lie owed me for his wonderful deliverance; nay, that
he would not only inform his countrymen of me, but ac-
company hundreds of them to .my kingdom, and make
mo a miserable sacrifice like those unhappy wretcii es
taken in battle.
Indeed I was very much to blame to have those cruet
and unjust suspicions, and most freely own I wronged the
poor creature very much, who was of a quite contrary
temper. And had he had that discerning acuteness which
many Europeans have, he would certainly have perceived
my coldness and indifference, and also have been very
much concerned upon that account: as I was now mora
circumspect, I had much lessened my kindness and famir
liarity with him, and while this jealousy continued, I used
that artful way (now too much in fashion, the occasion of
strife and dissention) of pumping him daily thereby to dis-
cover whether he was deceitful in his thoughts and incli
nations ; but certainly he had nothing in him but what
was'consistent with the best principles, both as a religious
Christian and a grateful friend ; and indeed, I found eve-
ry thing he said was ingenuous and innocent, that I had
no room for suspicion, and in spite of all uneasiness, he
not only made me entirely his own again, but also caus-
ed me much to lament that I ever conceived, one ill.
thought of him.
As we were walking up the same hill another day, when»
the weather was so hazy at sea, that I could not perceive
the continent, Friday, said I, don't you wish yourself to be.
in your own country, your nation, among your old friends
and acquaintances ?" Yes," said he, "me much O glad
"to be at my own nation." And what would you do there,
Friday? Would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh, and
be a savage as you were formerly ?" No,no," (answered
he, full of concern, and shaking his head) " Friday now
"tell them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to
"eat corn bread, cattle flesh, milk, no eat man again."
But surely, replied I, if you w,ould offer to do all this, they
will kill you ; and to manifest their contempt of such in-
struction eat you up when they have done. He then put
on a grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying,
"No, they no kill me, they willing love learn :" that is,
that they would be very willing to learn : adding withal,
"that they had learned" much of the bearded mans that
"came in the boat." Will you, said I, go back again,
Friday? He smiled at that, and told me, that he could not
swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe for you.
"Yes, master,'' said he," me go if you go, me no go if
'' you stay." I go, Friday ! why would you have them to.
eat me up, and devour your kind master ?" No, no," said.
he," me make them not eat master, and me make them
"much love you ;" that is, he would tell them howl had
slain his enemies, and thereby saved his life, for which
reason he would make them love me ; and then he related
to me as well as he was able, how exceedingly kind those
of his nation were to the white, or bearded men, as he
called them, who, in their great calamity, were driven into
their country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong inclinations
to venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to
join these white bearded men,'who undoubtedly were
Spaniards or Portuguese ; for, thought I, it must be cer-
tainly a better and safer way to escape when tjiere is a good
company, than for me alone, from an island forty miles off
the shore, and without any assistance. Some days after,
Friday and I being at work, as usual, at the same time di-
verting ourselves with various discourses, Ltold him I had
aboat which I would bestow upon him, whenever he pleas-
ed to return to his own nation; and to convince him of
the truth of what I said, I took him with me to the other
side of the island, where my frigate lay, and then taking
it from under the water (for I always kept it sunk for fear
of a discovery) we went both into it to see how it would
manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dextrous in rowing
than my faithful servant, making the boat go as fast again
as I could. Well now Friday, said I, shall we now go to
your so much admired nation ? But instead of meetingwith
that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and me-
lancboly at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised
me, tiil he made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat's being too small to go so fur a voyage. Upon
•which 1 let him understand I had a much bigger ; and ac-
cordingly, the next day went to the place where the first
boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength I had or
art I could use failed me in my attempt to get it into the
water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty
years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became
in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such aUtoat.
would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to caWy
enoi(gh-ulttle, drink, bread, for ih&t was his way of talking.
In short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my design of
going over with him to the Continent, I very plainly lold
him, that we would both go and make a boat full as big
*nd more proportionable than that, wherein he might safe-
ly return to his own nation.
These words made Friday look so very pensive, that I
thought he would have fallen at^ my feet. It was some
time before he could speak a word, which made me ask
him, what was the matter with him? He replied in a ve-
ry soft and moving tone, "What has poor Friday done?
"why are you angry mad with poor servant ? What me
"done, O what me done I" Friday, said I, you never yet
tave offended me, what makes you think I am angry with
you when I am not angry at all. "You no angry, no
1 angry," .said he, several times; "if you be no angry,
'' why den send Friday over great water to my own na-
"lion?" Why, surely, Friday, answered I, did not you
wish to be there, when from a mountain you beheld the
place where you was born? and is it not to satisfy your
desires that I am willing to give you leave to return thi-
ther ?^; Yes,yes,"said Friday,"me wish to be there sure
"enough, but then me wish master there too: no wish Fri-
1' day there, no master there." In short, he could not en-
dure the thoughts of going there without me I go there!
Friday, said I, what shall I do there ? He answered very
quickly," O master, you do great deal much good, you
"each all de wild mans to be good tame mans : you learn
"dem to be sober, live good life, to know God, ar.d pray
"God." Alas!poor Friday, said I,what can I do against
their priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what good can I
make your nation sensible of, when I myself am but apoor
ignorant man ?" No, no, master," said he, "you be noig-
K norant, you teachee me good, ypu teachee them good."
You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I don't care
to accompany'you thither'; I would rather live in this sol-
itude than venture among such inhuman savages Go
your way, since you desire it, and leave me alone by-my. -
self, as 1 was before I saved your life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Fri-
day was at these words. '' Go me away, leave master
"away," said he, after a long- silence, '• no, no, Friday die,,
"Friday live not master gone," as though he had s.'id, I
neither can nor will live, ifmy master sendiume from him.
And here I cannot but take notice of the strong lies of
friendship, which many times surpass those of tonsan--
guinity : for often we find a great disagreement among
; and when there is any seeming regard for each"
K. 2-
other, it is very seldom true, and scarce ever lasting, if
powerful interest does not bear the sway ; and that alone
is often the occasion of the greatest hatred in the world,
which is to desire, the death of parents and relations, for
the sake of acquiring their fortunes. But there was no
such thing between my servant and me; instead of which
there was the greatest gratitude and the most sincere love;
he found me not only his deliverer, but preserver and com-
forter; not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving,
and affable friend. He wanted for no manner of susten-
ance; and when he was ill or out of order, I was his phy-
sician, not only for his body but his soul; and therefore
no wonder was it that such an innocent creature, long
since divested of his former natural cruelty, should have
an uncommon concern at so cruel a separation from me,
which pierced him to the very soul, and made him desire
even to die, rather than live without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless manner, that
lie should be at his liberty as soon as the boat was made,
the language of his eyes expressed all imaginable confu-
sion; when immediately running to one of his hatchets,
which he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it
iqto my hand, with a heart so full that he could scarcely
speak. Friday, said I, what is it you mean? What must
I do with this ?" Only kill Friday," said he,'' Friday care
"not live long." But what must I kill you for ? replied I
again. '• Ah! dear master, what made you Friday save
"from eat a me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday
"love God, and love not Benamuckee, and now Friday
»' send away; never see Friday more." As though the
poor creature had said, Alas! my dearest, kind master,
how comes it to pass, that after having ventured your pre-
cjous life to save me from the jaws ot devouring cannibals,
like myself, after such a tender regard to provide for me
such a comfortable nourishment, and continuing so long
a kind master, and a most sincere friend; and after mak-
ing me forsake the false notion of an Indian deity, and
worship the true God in spirit and in truth; and after
all this,how comes it now, that you are wilfing, to send me
away to my former course of living, by which means un-
doubtedly we shall be dead to each other; but greater
must be my misfortune, that I shall never behold my
best friend I have in the world any more. And this un-
doubtedly, though he could not express himself so clear-
ly, must be his sentiments; for the tears ran down his
cheeks in such a plentiful manner, that I had naich ado
to refrain from weeping also, when I beheld the poor crea-
ture's affection; so that 1 was forced to comfort him in the
best manner I could, which I did, by telling him, if he was
content to abide with me, I should be ever willing to keep
him. %•'
After Friday's grief was something abated, more fully
to convince me of his affection, he said, " O master, me
"not care to be in my nation, leave you here; me desire
"nation learn good, that's all ;" meaning, that his desire
'was for the conversion of that barbarous people. But as
I had no apostolic mission, nor any concern aboui their
salvation ; so I had not the least intention or desire of un-
dertaking it; and the strength of my inclination, in order
to escape, proceeded chiefly from my late discourse with
Friday, about these seventeen white bearded men, that had
been driven upon the barbarian coast ; whom I designed
to join as the only means to further our escape. To
\vhichintent my man and I went to. search for a proper
tree to fell, whereof we might make a large perigua or ca-
noe, to undertake the voyage; and, indeed, we were not
long in finding one fit for our purpose, there being enough
of wood in the island to have built a fleet of large vessels,
but the thing we principally wanted was to get one so near
the water, that we might launch it after it was finished,
and not commit so horrid a mistake as I had done oncfc
before.
Well, after a great search for what was best and most
convenient, Friday, at last whose judgment in such affairs
was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood
the most fittmg for it. To this day I cannot tell the name
of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by-
saying, that it is very like what we caUfuatic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, being much of the same
colour and smell. But though my man exceeded me in
the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I showed him
a much belter and clearer way to make a canoe than ever
he knew before ; for he was for burning the hollow or ca-
vity of the tree, in order to muke this boat; but I then
told him how he might do it wiih tools, learning him at
the same time how to use them, which indeed he did very
desirously; so that in a month's time we finished it, mak-
ing it very handsome by cutting the outside in the true
shape of a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight be-
fore we could get her into the water, which we did as it
were inchby inch upon great rollers; but when she was
in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease
imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be sure at the-
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no less ama-
zed to behold with what dexterity my man would manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday, said
I, what do you think of it now ? Do you think this will
carry us over ?" Yes, master," said lie," me venture
"over well, though great blow wind." But my design was
yet farther, which he was insensible of; and that was to
make a mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor
and cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all
to procure : so that I fixed upon a straight young cedar-
tree, which I found near the place, great plenty of it
abounding in the island ; and setting Friday to cut it down,
I gave him particular directions how to shape and order
it; but as to the sail, that I managed myself. I very well
knew I had some old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which
had lain six and twenty years by me ; but not being care-
ful to preserve them, as thinking I should have no occa-
sion to use them any more, when I came to overlook them
I found them almost all rotten, except two ; and with these
I went to work and after a great deal of pains and av,-k-
ward tedious stitching for want of needles, at length I fin-
ished a three-cornered ugly thing,like what we call inEng-
]and a shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom at bot-
tom, and a little sprit at the top, like those which our long-
boats use, and which I very well knew how to manage,
especially since it was like that which I had in my pa-
tron's fishing boat, when with my boy Xury, I made my
escape from the Barbarian shore.
It was near two months, I think, before I completed this
work, that is, the rigging and fitting my mast and sails:
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small
stay and a sail, or a foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to the westward; and, what is still more, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and though I
was but a very indifferent shipwright, yet as I was sensi-
ble of the great usefulness and absolute necessity of a thing
like this, I applied myself to it with such a constant appli-
cation, that at. last I accomplished my design ; but w^at
•with the many dull contrivences I had about it, and the
failure of many things, it cost me as much pains in order-
ing as in making the boat. Besides, when all this was
done, I had my man to teach what belonged to its naviga-
tion; for though he very well understood how to paddle
a canoe along, ht was an utter stranger to a sail and a rud-
der, and was amazed when he saw me work the boat to
and again in the sea, by them, and how the sail jibed and
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed chang-
ed. After some time and a little use, I made all these
thmgs very familiar to him, so that he became an expert
sailor, .except in relation to the compass, and that I could
make him understand but little of. But, as it happened,
there was seldom occasion for it, there beingbut little clou-
dy weather, and scarce any fog in those parts; the stars
were always visible in the night, and the shore perspicuous
by day, except in the rainy season, which confined every
one to his habitation. Thus entered in the seven and
twentieth year of my reign, or Captivity, which you please
(the last three of which, blessed with the company of my
man Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept the anniver-
sary of my landing here, with the same thankfulness-to
God for his tender mercies, as I did before ; and certain-
ly, as I had great cause ibr a thankful acknowledgment for
rriy deiivevance at first, I had much greater now for such
singular and additional testimonies of the care of Provi-
dence over me, m all my distress both of body and mind)
and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered ; for I had a strong impression upon my mind,
that 1 should not be another year in this island. But how-
ever I still continued on with my husbandry, digging,
planting, and fencing, as usual ; gathering and curing my
grapes, and doing all other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to corr/e on, obli-
ged me to keep the longer within doors ; but before this,
I brought my new vessel into the creek, where I had land-
ed my rafts from the ship, and hauling her up to the shore,
I ordered my man Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold
her in, and deep enough to give her water, wherein she
might float, and then when die tide was out, we made a
strong dam across the end of it, to keep out, the water, by
which means she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea;
and to keep the rain from her, we thatched her over, as it
were, with boughs of trees, like a house, so we waited
for the months of November and December, in which I
designed to venture over the ocean.
No sooner did the seasonable weather begin to draw
near, but so much was I elevated with this new designed
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The
first thing I thought on was to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, in-
tending in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and
to launch out the boat for that purpose. But one morn-
ing as 1 was very busy upon something necessary for this
occasion, I called Friday to me, and bid him to go to the
sea shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a.
thing which we commonly had once a week, as much on
account of the eggs, as for the sake of the flesh. He had
not been long gone but he came running back as though
he was pursued for life, and as it were flew over my outer
wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or steps he
set his feet on ; and before I had time to enquire the rea-
son of his precipitation, he cries out, " O dear master, O
"sorrow, sorrow I Bad O bad !" Why what's the matter
Friday? said I. "O yonder, yonder!" said he, " there
"be one, two or three canoes! two three !" Surely thought
J, there must be six, by my man's way of reckoning;
•but on a strict enquiry, 1 found there were but three. Well
Friday, said I, don't be terrified, I Warrant you we will not
only defend ourselves against them, but kill the most of
these cruel savages. But though I comforted him in the
best manner I could, the poor creature trembled so, that
I scarce knew what to do with him :—" O master," saidlie,
"they come look Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up."
Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me up as well as you,
and my danger is as great as )'ours. But since it is so,
we must resolve to fight for our lives. What say you?
Can you fight, Friday ?" Yes," said he, very faintly," me
"shoot, me kill what I can,but there come a great ma-
"ny number." That's no matter, said I again, ourgunswill
terrify those that we do not kill; I am very willing to stand
by you to the last drop of my blood. Now tell me if you
will do the like by me, and obey my orders in whatsoever
I command ? Friday then answered, " O master, me lose
"life for you, me die when you bid die." Thus concluding
all questions concerning his fidelity, immediately I fetched
him A good dram of rum, of which I had been a very good
husband, and gave it him to comfort his heart. After he
%
had drank it, I ordered him to take the tAvo fowling-pieces
which we always carried, and load them with large swan-
shot as big as small pistol bullets; then I took four mus-
kets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five small bul-
lets each; charging my two pistols each with a brace, I
hung my great sword, as customary, naked to my side,
and gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent weapon
of defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any
knight errant that ever handled a sword and spear. I took
my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill,
to see what I could discover; and I perceived very soon,
by vny glass, that there were one and twenty savages, three
prisoners and three canoes, and that their chief concern
seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor
human bodies, a thing which by this time 1 had observed
was very common with them. I also remarked that they
tlid not land at that place from whence Friday made his
escape, but nearer to the creek, where the shore was low,
and where a thick wood came very close to the sea, My
soul was then filled with indignation and abhorrence at such
inhuman wretches, which put a period to all my former
thoughts in their vindication, neither would J give myself
time to consider their right of conquest, as I had done be-
fore; but descending from the mountain, I came down to
Friday, and told him, I was resolved to go speedily to them
and kill them all; asking him again, iti the same 1n' ,.tb,
if he would stand by me: when by this time being recov-
ered from his fright,and his spirits much cheered with the
dram I had given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously
telling me, as he did before, " When I bid die, he would
"die.
And now it was, having fixed my resolution in so strong
a manner, that nothing could divest my breast of its un-
common fury. I immediately divided the loaded arms be-
twixt us. To my man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his
girdle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too
great, I confess to bear; but what must a poor king do,
who had but one soldier in the world! But to show I made
him bear no more than what 1 would lay on myself, I stuck
the other pistol in my girdle, and the other three guns, np-
on my shoulders; nay something more, but that was like
-Esop's burden, a small bottle of rum, which was soon
-lightened to our exceeding refreshment. Thus we march-
*
ed out, under a ponderous load of armour, like two invin-
cible champions, with a quantity of powder and bullets to
stand our battle, and load again, when the pieces were dis-
charged. And now my orders being to be obeyed, I charg-
ed Friday to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot
or attempt any thing till I commanded him; and in the
interim, not to speak as much as one word It was in this
order I fttched a compass to the right hand, of near a
mile, as well to get over the creek, as to attain the wood;
and by this, I thought to come within shot of them before
I could be discerned, as I found by my glass, would not
be difficult to accomplish.
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even
in our greatest fury and strongest inclinations? For while
I was taking this march, my resolution began to abate, not
through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked
unarmed wretches, but those reflections occurred to my
thoughts: what power I was commissioned with or what
occasion or necessity had I to go and embrue my hands in
human blood, and murder peoplethat had neither done nor
intended to do me any wrong? They were innocent in
particular as to me; and their barbarous custom was not
only their misfortune but a sign that God had left them in
'the most immense stupidity; but yet did not warrant me
to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner
of his righteous judgments: That, on the contrary, when-
ever he thought fit, he would lake vengeance on them him-
self, and punish them in a national way, according to their
national crimes; but this was nothing at all to me, who
had no concern with them. Indeed my man Friday might
justify himself, because they were his declared enemies,
ofthatvery same nation that went io sacrifice him before }
and indeed, it was lawful for him to attack them, which
I could not say was so with respect to me.—So warmly
did these things press upon my thoughts all the way I
went that I only resolved to place myself so as to behold
their bloody entertainment, without falling upon them,
except something more than ordinary, by God's special
direction, should oblige me thereto.
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into the thick wood
(my man Friday following me close behind) when with
all possible wariness and silence, 1 marched till I came to
the skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest to them,
for only one end of the wood interposed between me and
them. Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, that was just at the corner of the
wood, I ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word,
if he could plainly perceive their actions ;accordingly he
did as I commanded him, and came back with this melan-
choly story, that they were all about their fire, eating the
flesh of one of their prisoners ; and that another lay bound
upon the sand, at a little distance from them, which they
designed for the next sacrifice, and this he told me was not
one of their nation, but one of those very bearded men, who
were driven by a storm into their country, and of whom
he had so often talked to me about. You may be sure, that
upon hearing this, my soul was ready to sink within me:
when ascending into a tree, 1 saw plainly, by my glass, a
white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his
hands and feet tied with flags,or things resembling rushes,
being covered with clothes, and seemed to be an European.
From the tree where I took this prospect, I perceived ano-
ther tree and a thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer
to them than where I was, which by taking a small circle
round I might come at undiscovered, and then I should be
within half a shot of these devourers. And this consider-
ation alone to be more perfectly revenged upon them,
made me withhold my passion, though I was enraged to
the highest degree imaginable; when going back about
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all
the way till I came to the other tree ; and then I ascended
to a little rising ground not above eighteen yards distance,
and there I had a full view of these creatures, and I could
perceive all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear as obliged me not to lose
a moment's time. No less than nineteen of these dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground,close huddled together, ex-
pressing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous an en-
tertainment ; and they had just sent the other two to mur-
der this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by
limb to their fire; for they were then just going to untie
the bands from his feet, in order for death, as fetters are
knocked off the feet of malefactors before they go to the
place of execution. Hereupon, immediately turning to my
man, now, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing
but do exactly as you see me do. All which he promising
he would perform, I set down one of my muskets, and
fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same
L
by his; and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages bidding him do the like: Are you ready ? said I:
"Yes, Master," said he ; why then fire at them, said I;
and that very moment I gave fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two, but my man Friday,
taking his aim much better than I, killed two, and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful conster-
nation, at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had
yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped up
on their feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew
not which way to run or look ; not knowmg from whence
their destruction came. We threw down our pieces, and
took up others, giving a second dreadful volley ; but as
they were loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bul-
, lets, we perceived only two of them fall; tho' many were
wounded, who run yelling and screaming about like mad
creatures. Now Friday, said I, lay down your piece, and
take up the musket, and follow me. He did so, with great
courage, when showing ourselves to the savages we gave
a great shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who
would have been sacrificed, had not our first fire obliged
the butchers, with three others, to jump into a canoe. By
ray order, Friday fired at them, at which shot I though*
he killed them all, by reason of their falling to the bottom
of the boat; however he killed two, and mortally wound-
ed a third. In the mean time,' I cut the flags that tied the
hands and feet of the poor creature, and lifting him up ask-
ed him in the Portuguese tongue, What he was ? He an-
swered me in Latin, Christianus; but so very weak and
faint,that he could scarce £tandor speak. ImmediatelyIgave
him a dram, and a piece of bread to cherish him, and
asked him, What countryman he was ? He said, Hisfianiola,
and then uttered all the thankfulness imaginable for his
deliverance. Signior, said 1, with as much Spanish as I
was master of, let us talk afterwards, but fight now:
Here, take this sword and pistol, and do what you can,
Andindeed,jhe did so with such courage and intrepidity, that
he cut two of them to pieces in an instant, the savages not
having the power to fly for their lives. I ordered Friday
to run for those pieces we left at the tree.which he brought
with great swiftness, and then I gave him my musket,
while I loaded the rest.
But now there happened a fierce encounter between the
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with

one of their wooden swords ; and though the former was
as brave as could be expected, having twice wounded his
enemy in the head, yet being weak and faint, the Indian
had thrown him upon the ground, and was wresting my
sword out of his hand, which he Spaniard every wisely
quitting, drew out his pistol, and shot him through the bo-
dy before I could come near him, tho' I was running to his
assistance. As to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches
with his hatchet, dispatching three, but the rest were too
nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fowling
pieces, wounded two, who running into the wood, Friday
pursued and killed; but the other, notwithstanding his
wounds, plunged himself into the sea, and swam to those
•who were left in the canoe, which, with one wounded,
were all that escaped out of one and twenty. The ac-
count is as follows:

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out
of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them;
and, indeed, I was no less anxious about their escape, lest
after the news had been carried to their people, they
should return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being re-
solved to pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes,
and bid Friday follow me ; but no sooner was I in, than,
to my surprise, 1 found another poor creature, bound hand
.and foot for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been,
•with very little life in him. Immediately I unbound him,
and would have helped him up; but he could neither stand
nor speak, but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was
only unbound in order to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday
speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; when pull-
ing out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram,
•which, with the joyful news he had received, so revived
bis heart, that he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday
began to hear him speak, and look more fully in his face,
it would have moved any one to tears, to perceive his un-
common transports of joy; for he kissed, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, dan-
red, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his face
and head, then sung, then cried and jumped about again,
like u distracted creature; so that it was a great while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what
was the matter with him; but when he came to the liberty
of his speech, at last he told me it was his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged pa-
rent. He would set down by him in the boat, open his
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherish him : then he took his arms
and ancles, which were stiff and numbed, with binding, and
'hafed and rubbed them with his hands; by which means,
perceiving what the case was, I gave him some rum,
which proved of great benefit to him.
While we were busy in this action, the savages had got-
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pur-
sue them: For there arose from the north-west,which con-
tinued all night long, such a violent storm, that I could not
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this 1 called Friday to me, and asked him if he had given
his father any bread? He shook his head, and said," None,
"not one bit, me cat-a all up ;" so I gave him a cake of
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I like-
wise gave him a dram for himself, and two or three bunch-
es of raisins for his father. Both these he carried to him,
for he would make him drink the dram to comfort him.
Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitch-
ed, with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out
of sight as it were in an instant ; but at his return, I
perceived him slacken his pace, because he had some-
thing in his hand. And this I found to be, as he ap-
proached nearer, an earthen jug with some water for his
father, with two more cakes of bread, which he delivered
into my hands. Being very thirsty myself, I drank some
of the water, of which when his father had drank suffi-
ciently, it more revived his spirits than all the rum 1 had
given him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was re-
posing himself on a green place, under the shade of a tree,
but so weak, that though he exerted himself he could not
stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to rub
and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's.
But every minute he was employed in this, he would cast
a wishful eye towards the boat, where he left his lather sit-
ing ; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning to
him, and finding he had only iaid himself down to ease his
limbs, he returned back to me presently, and then 1 spoke
to the Spaniard to let Friday help him and lead him to the
boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where I
would take care of him. Upon which Friday took him
upon his back, and so carried him to the canoei setting him
close by his father ; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster
than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard too,
and having brought them safe to the creek, away he runs
to fetch the other canoe. Which he brought to the creek al-
most as soon as I got toil by land, when wafting me over,
ke took our new guests out of the boat; but so weak were
they, that 1 was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow?
and when I came to my castle, not being willing to make
an entrance into my wall, we made them a handsome tent
covered with old sails, and boughs of trees, making two
good beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon and co-
ver them. Thus, like an absolute king o^er my subjects-
who owed-their lives to me, I thought myself very consi-
derable, especially as 1 had now three religions in my
kingdom, my man Friday being a, Protestant, his father a
Pagan, and the Spaniard a Paptist : but I gave liberty of
conscience to all
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill me a yearling goat: which when he had done,
I cut off the hinder quarters and chopping it into small
pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice into
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a-table, dined
with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday was my
interpreter to his father, and mdeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savage pretty well. After
dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all arms from the
field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodies,.
which he did accordingly.
And now 1 made Friday inquire of his father whether he
thought these savages had escaped the late storm, in theis
L 2
canoe ? and if so, whether they -would not return with a
power too great for us to resist? He answered, that he
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if
they were driven southwardly, they would come to a land
where they would as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their
own country, the strangeness of their fatal and bloody at-
tack,would make them tell their people, that the rest of
them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand
of man, but by.two heavenly spirits (meaning Friday and
me) who were sent from above to destroy them. And
this, he said he knew, because he heard them say the
same to one another. And indeed he was in the right
on't; for I have since heard that these four men gave out
that whoever went to that inchanted island, would be de-
stroyed by the fire from the Gods.
No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap-
prehensions ceased : instead of which my former thoughts
of a voyage took place, especially when Friday's father as-
sured me I should have good usage in his nation. As to
the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more of his coun-
trymen and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made
their escape thither; that though they were in union with
the savages, yet they were very miserable for want of pro-
visions and other necessaries. When 1 asked him about
the particulars of this voyage, he answered that their ship
was bound from the Ri*de la Plata, to the Havanna ; that
when the ship was lost, only five men perished in the
ocean ; the rest having saved themselves in the boat, were
now landed on the main continent. And, what do they in-
tend to do there ? said 1. He replied, they Bfcye concerted
measures to escape, by building a vessel, but that they
had neither tools nor provisions, so that all their designs
came to nothing- Supposing, said I, I should make a pro-
posal, and invite them here, would they not carry me pri-
soner to new Spain ? he answered no ; for he knew them
to be such honest men, as would scorn to act with such
inhuman baseness to their deliverer: That, if I pleased,
he and the old savage would go over to them, talk with
them about it, and bring me an answer : that they should
all swear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the Holy Sa-
crament ; and For his part he would not only do the same,
but stand to the last drop of his blood, should there be oc-
casion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose ; but
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard raised an ob-
jection that carried a great deal of weight with it : " You
"know, Sir." said he," that having been some time with
"you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and
"corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present, but not for
"them, should they come over presently: much less to
"victual a vessel for an intended voyage. Want might
"be as great an occasion for them to disagree and rebel,
"as the children of Israel did against God himself, when
"they wanted bread in the wilderness. And, therefore,
"my advice is, to wait another harvest, and in the mean
"time cultivate and improve some more land, whereby
"we may have plenty of provision, in order to execute
"our design."
This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely;
and so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him
ever after. And thus we all four went to work upon some
more land, and against seed time we had gotten so much
cured and trimmed up, sufficient to sow twenty-twp bushels
of barley, and sixteen jars of rice,which was, in short, all
the seed we had to spare As we were four in number, and
by this time all in good health, we feared not an hundred
Indians, should they venture to attack us; and while the
corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit to build
us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over ;which
being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut them
down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my privy
counsellor, to oversee and direct the work. 1 likewise in-
creased my flocks of goats by shooting the wild dams, and
bringing home their kids to my inclosure : Nor did I ne-
glect the grape season, but cured them as usual, though
I had such a quantity now, as would have filled eighty bar-
rels with raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they
in working, and I in providing for them, till harvest came,
God Almighty blessed the increase of it so much, that
from twenty-two barrels of barley, we thrashed out two
hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice, suffi-
ceint to victual a ship fit to carry me and all the Spaniards
to any part of America.
Thus the prmcipal objection being answered, by a suffi-
cient stock of provisions, I *ent my two ambassadors over
to the main land, with a regal authority to administer the
oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, tho' I never asked whether they
had pen, ink or paper; when giving each of them a mus-
ket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impa-
tient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morning,
when a strange accident happened, which was ushered in
by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud,"Mas-
"ter,master, they are come, they are come." Upon which,
not dreaming of any danger, out 1 jumped from my bed,
put on my clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
and looking towards the sea, 1 perceived a boat about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore with the
wind fair. I saw they did not come from the side where
thelandlay on, but fromthe southernmostendof the island:
So these being none of the people we wanted, I ordered
Friday to lie still, till such time as I came down from the
mountain, which, with my ladder, I now ascended, in or-
der to discover more fully what they were ; and now with,
the assistance of n,y perspective glass, I plainly perceived
an English ship, which 1 concluded to be, by the fashion
of its long boat ; and it filled me withsuch uncommon trans-
ports of joy, that I cannot tell how to describe ; and yet
some secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I
know not what cause, as though I had reason to be upon,
my guard. And indeed I would have no man contemn,
the secret hints and intimations of danger, which very
often are given, when he may imagine there is no possi-
bility of its being real ; for had I not been warned by this-
silent admonition I, had been in a worse situation thatk
before, and perhaps inevitably ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach
the shore, as though they looked for a place where they
might conveniently land ; and at last they ran their boat
on shore upon the beach, about half a mile's distance;
which proved the happier for me, since, had they come in-
to the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might
not only have forced me out of my castle, but plundered
me of all I had in the world. Now I was fully convinced
they wre all Englishmen, three of which were unarmed
and bound ; when immediately the first tour or five leaped
on shore, and took those three out of the boat as prisoners}
t -I.
one of whom I could perceive used the most passionate
gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while the
others in a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as-
tonished, and I beckoned to Friday who was below, to as-
cend the mountain, and likewise view this sight. "O mas-
"ter," said he to me, " you see English mans eat prison-
"ers as well as savage mans." And do you think they
will eat them, Friday ? said I. "Yes," said Friday," they
"eat-a all up." No, no, said I, Friday, I am much more
concerned lest they murder them, but as for eating them
up, that I am sure they will never do,
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav-
ing the Spaniard and savage with me, but also that 1 could
not come within shot of them unperceived, they having
no fire arms among them, and save these three men, whom
I thought they were going to kill with their swords. But
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were set
at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen
scattering about as though they had a mind to see the
place; and so long did they negligently ramble, that the
tide had ebbed so low, as to leave the boat aground. Nor
were the two men who were in her more circumspect; for
having drank a little too much liquor, they fell fast asleep;
but one of them waking before the other, and perceiving
the boat too fast aground for his strength to move it, he
hallooed out to the rest who, made all possible expedition
to come to him; but as Providence ordered it, all their
force was ineffectual to launch her. when I could hear
them speak to one another," Why let her alone, Jack,
"can't ye ; she'll float next tide ;" by which words I was
fully convinced they were my own countrymen. I all this
while lay very quiet, as being fully sensible it could be no
less than ten hours before the boat would be afloat, and
then it would be so dark, that they could not easily per-
ceive me, by which means I should be at more liberty to
hear their talk, and observe all their motions : not but that
I prepared for my defence: yet, as I had another sort of
enemy to combat with, I acted with more caution. I took
two fusees on my shoulder, and gave Friday three mus-
kets; besidesmy formidable goat-skin coat and monstrous
cap made me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules of
old, especially when two pistols were stuck in my belt,
and my naked sword hanging by my side.
It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it
was dark; and it being now two o'clock, in the very heat
of the day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and
undoubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three poor dis-
tressed creatures,too anxious to get any repose,were how-
ever seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quar-
ter of a mile from me. Upon which, without any more
ado, I approached towards them, with my man following
behind me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud to
them in Spanish,'l What are ye, Gentlemen?"
At these words, they started up in great confusion, when
they beheld the strange figure I made ; they returned no
answer, but seemed as if they would fly from me ; " Gen-
•' tlemen," said I, in English, " don't be afraid) perhaps
"you have a friend nearer than you expect." " He must
'' be from Heaven," said one of them, gravely pulling off
his hat, "for we are past all help in this world.1' " All
M help is from Heaven," replied 1 : " But Sir, as I have
"perceived every action between you and these brutes
"since your landing, only inform me how to assist youi
"and I will do it to the utmost of my power.'*
"Am I talking with God or man ?'' said he, in melting
tears. "Are you of human kind or an angel?" "Sir,"
said I, " my poor habit will tell you I am a man, and an
"Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant
"only : here are arms and ammunition : tell freely your
« condition: Can we save you?" "The story," said he,
"is too long to relate, since our butchers are so near : but
,M~ Sir, I was master of that ship, my men have mutinied,
"and it is a. favour they have put my mate, this passenger,
"and me, on shore without murdering us, though we ex-
"pect nothing but perishing here." " Are your enemies
"gone ?" said I. " No," replied he, pointing to a thicket,
"there they lie, while my heart trembles, lest having seen
"and heard us, they should murder us all." " Have they
"fire arms?" said I. "They have but two pieces,"
said, he" one of which is left in the boat." He also told
me there were two enormous villians among them, that
were the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed
or seized, might induce the rest to return to their obedi-
ence. "Well, well," said I.,, let us retire farther under
"the covering of the woods ;" and there it was I made
these conditions with him:
i
I. That, while they staid in the island, they should not
pretend to any authority ; but should entirely conform
to my orders, and return me the arms which I should put
in their hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford
Friday and myself a passage grati* to England
When he had given me all the satisfuction I could desire,
I gave him and his two companions each of them a gun,
•with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon
them as they lay sleeping. The captain modestly said,
that he was borry to kill th<-m ; though, on the other hand,
to letthese villians escape,who were the authors of his mis-
ery, might be the ruin of us all. "Well," said he,'' do
"as you think fit;" and so accordingly I fired, killed one of
the Captain's chief enemies and wounding the other, \vho
eagerly c.illed for assistance ; but the Captain who had re-
served his piece, coming up to him, " Sirrah," said he,
"'tis too late to call for assistance you should rather cry
"to God to pardon your villany ;" and so knocked him
down with the stock of his gun; three others were also
slightly wounded; who at my approach cried out for mer-
cy. This the Captain granted, upon condition that they
would swear to be true to him in recovering his ship,
which they solemnly did; however I obliged the Captain
to keep them bound. After which I sent Friday and the
Captain's mate to secure the boat and bring away the oars
and sails ; when, at their return, three men coming back,
and seeing their late distressed Captain, now their con-
queror, submitted to be bound also.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the
adventures of my whole life, which he heard with a serious
and wonderful attention. After this, I curried him and
his two companions into my little fortified castle, showed
them all my conveniencies, and refreshed them with such
provisions as I could afford. When this was over, we be-
gan to consider about regaining the ship; he said there
were twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their lives
were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and mutiny, were,
so very hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small
company to attack them. This was a reasonable inference
indeed; but something we must resolve on, and imme-
diately put in execution, we therefore heaved the boat up
on the beaclrso high, that she could not shoot off at high
water mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to he stop-
ped ; so that all the signals they gave to the boat to come
on board were in vain. This obliged them to send another
boat on shore, with ten men armed, whose faces the Cap-
tain plainly descried,the Boatswain being the chief officer;
but observed there were three honest lads among them,
who were forced into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave
him fresh courage (for I perceived he was in concern :)
in the mean time securing our prisoners, except two
whom we took to our assistance, we thought ourselves able
to adventure a battle. When the sailors landed, and saw
their boat in that condition, they not only hallooed, but fired
for their companions to hear, yet received no answer. This
struck them with horror and amazement, thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if they would
return to the ship. I could perceive the Captain's counte-
nance change at this, till all a of sudden, three men were
ordered to look after the boat, while the remaining seven
leapt on shore in order to look for their companions; and
indeed they came to the brow of the hill near my ancient
castle, from whence they could see to a great distance in
the woods, and there shouting and hallooing till tired and
weary, they at length seated themselves under a spreading
tree. My opinion was that nothing could be done till night,
when I might use some artifice to get them all out of the
boat; but of a sudden they started up, and made to the
sea-side; hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's
mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could
and so decoying them into the woods, come round to me,
again. And this had a good effect; for they followed the
noise, till coming westward to the creek, they called for
their boat to carry them over, and taking one of the men
out of her, left two to look after her, having fastened her
to a stump of a little tree on shore. Hereupon imme-
diately the Captain and our party passing the creek, out of
their view, we surprised them both, by the Captain's
knocking down one, and ordering the other to surrender
on pain of death, and who being the honestest of them all,
sincerely joined us.
By this time it was pretty late ; when the rest returning
to their boat, which they found aground in the creek, the
tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wringing their
hands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that they
should be all murderedby spirits or devils. My men would
willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not agree to
hazard any of our party. But, to be more certain, Friday
and the Captain crawled upon their handsandfeet, as near
as possible; and when the boatswain approached in sight,
so eager was the captain, that he fired and killed him on
the spot; Friday wounded the next man, and a third ran
away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole army; and,
it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised in the
boat, to call them by tbeir names, and to parley with them.
Accordingly he called out aloud, " Tom Smith, Tom
"Smith !" He answered," Who's that?" "Robinson!" an-
swered the other. "For God's sake Tom, surrender im-
"mediately, or you're all dead men."" Who must we
"surrender to ?" says Smith. To our Captain and fifty,
"men here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will
"Frye, and killed the boatswain." " Shall we have quar-
"ters then ?" said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out,
"You Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately,
"and you shall all have your lives granted, except Will
"Atkins." Hereupon, Atkins cries out, '' What have I
"done Captain, more than the rest,who have been as bad
"as me ?" But that was a lye, for he was the person that
laid hold of him, and bound him. However, he was or-
dered to submit to the governor's mercy, for such was I
called. And so laying down their arms, we bound them
all, and seized on their boat.
After which the Captain expostulated with them,teliing
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might
execute them there, but he thought they would be sent to
England, except Will Atkins, who wasordered to prepare
for death next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the
Captain to intercede lor his life, and the rest begged they
might not be sent to England. This answered our project
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins and two of
the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being com-
mitted to my power, I sent the Captain to treat with them
in the governor's name, offering them pardon if they would
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all pro-
mised to stand by him till the last drop of their blood, and
whoever acted treacherously, should be hanged in chains
upon the beach. They were all released on these assur-
ances ; and then the Captain repaired to the other boat,
making his passenger captain of her, and gave him four
men well armed: while himself, mate, and five more.went
in the other boat. By midnight they Came wuhm call of
M
•the ship, when lhe Captain ordered Robinson to hail her,
and tell them that with great difficulty they found the men
at last. But while they were discoursing, the Captain, mate,
and the rest entered, and knocked down the second mate
and carpenter, secured those that were upon the deck, by
.putting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew
entered and secured theforecastle ; they then broke into the
round-house, where the mate, after some resistance, shot
;the pirate captain through the head, upon which all the
rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship be-
ing recovered, the joyful signal was fired, which I heard
•with the greatest joy imaginable : nor was it long before
,lie brought the ship•§> an anchor at the creek's mouth,
where coming to me unawares, " There," says he, " my
"dearest friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and we
.are your servants :" a comfort so unspeakable, as made
«ie swoon in his arms, while, with gratitude to Heaven,
we were tenderly embracing each other.
Nothing now remaining, but to consult what we should
do with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to
take^n board. Hereupon concerting with the Captain, I
dressed myself in one of his suite, ami sending (or them,
told them, that I was going to leave the island with all my
people, if they would turry there,their lives should be spa-
red : if not, they should be hanged at the first port they
came.at. They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them
my whole story, charging them to be kind to the Spaniards
that .were expected, gave them all my arms, and inform-
ing them of every thing necessary for their subsistence, I
and my man Friday went on board. But the next mor-
ning two of the men came swimming tothe ship's side, de-
siring the Cuptaui to take them on board, though he hang-
ed them afterwards, complaining mightily how barbarous-
ly the others used them. Upon which I prevailed with.
the Captain to take them in ; and being severely whipt and
pickled, they proved more honest for the future And
so I bid farewell to this island, carrying along with me my
money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-skin cap; setting
sail December 12, '.686, after twenty-eight years, two
,'nomhs, and nineteen days residence, that same day
and month that I escaped from Sallee, landing in England
June 11, 1687, after five and thirty years absence from
*ny own country, which rendered me altogether a Strau-
ss there.

Here I found my first Captain's widow alive^who had
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances,
and whom 1 rmde easy upon his account. Soon after I
we'H down to Yorkshire, where all my family were ex-
pired, except two sisters, and as many of one of my bro-
ther's children. I found no provision had been made for
me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that
I was but in a very slender station Indeed the Capuin
did me a great kindness, by his report to the owners,
how I had delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, up-
on which they made me a present of 2001. sterling. I
next went to Lisbon, taking my man Friday with me, and
there arriving in April, 1 met the Portuguese Captain
who had taken me on board on the African coast ; but,
being ancient, he had left off the sea, and resigned all his
business to his son, who followed the Brazil trade. So
altered both of us were, that we did not know each other
at first, till I discovered myself more fully to him. After
a few embraces, I began to enquire of my concerns; and
then the old gentleman told me, that it wus nine years since
he had been at Brazil, where my partner was then living,
but my trustees were both dead ; that he believed I should'
have a good account of the product of my plantation ; that
the imagination of my being lost, had obliged my trustees
to give an estimate of my share to the procurator fiscal,
who in case of my not returning, had given one third to
the king and the rest to the monastery of St. Augustine:
but if I put in my claim, or any one for me, it would be
returned, except the yearly product which was given to
the poor. I then desired them to tell me what improve-
ment he thought had been made of my plantation, and
whether he imagined it was worth my while to look after
it? he answered, he did not know how much it was im-
proved; but this he was certajs of, that my partner was
grown vastly rich upon half ofw; and, that he had been
informed, that the king had 2oO moidoies per annum for
his third part. He added, that the survivors of my trus-
tees were persons of an ingenuous character; that my part-
ner could witness my title, my name being registered in
the country, by which means Ishould indispensably recov-
er considerable sums of money. But, answered I, how
coul'd my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made you
only my heir? This, said he, was true ; but, there being
no affidavit made of my death, he could not act as my
executor. However, he had ordered his son (then at
Brazil) to act by procuration upon my account, and he
had taken possession of my sugar-house, having account-
ed himself for eight years with my partner and trustees
for the profits, of which he would give me a very good
account.
And indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few
days, making himself indebted tome 470 moidores of gold,
over and above what had been lost at sea, after I left the
place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes he
had gone through, which forced my money out of his hands
to buy part in a new ship: "But,"says he, "you shall
"not want, take this; and, when my son returns, every
"farthing shall be paid you." Upon which he put into
ray hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold, as likewise the
instrument, containing the title to the ship which his son
was in, and which he offered as security for the remainder.
But really when I saw so much goodness, generosity, ten-
derness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept it,
for fear he should straiten himself upon my account, "It
"is true, "said he, " it may be so; but then the money
1' is yours, not mine, and you may have the greatest oc-
"casion for it ." However, I returned fifty of them back
again, promising that I would freely forgive him the other
hundred when I got my effects into my hands, and that I
designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told me
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter
my name with a notary public, as likewise my affidavit,
•with a procuration affixed to it ; and this he ordered me to
send in a letter to one of his acquaintances, a merchant in
Brazil ; and indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and
honorably observed ; for in seven months time, I had a
very faithful account of all my effects, what sums of mo-
ney were raised, what expended, and what remained for
my use: In a word, llUmd my self to be worth 50001.
sterling, and a 1000 per annum. Nor was this all; for
my partner congratulated me upon my being alive, telling
me how much my plantation was improved, what Negroes
were at work, and how many A-ue Marias he had said to
the Virgin Mury for my preservation, desiring me to ac-
cept kindly some presents he had sent me, which I found
showed the greatest generosity.
No sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faith-
ful Captain, by returning him the hundred moidores, and
not only forgiving him all tie owed me, I allowed him
yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their
lives. And now being resolved to go to England, I return-
ed letters of thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in
particular to my old partner, with very suitable presents.
By the captain's advice, I was persuaded to go by land to
Calais, and there take passage for England; when, as it
happened, I got a young English gentleman, a merchant's
son at Lisbon, to accompany me, together with two Eng-
lish and two Portuguese gentleman; so that with a Por-
tuguese servant, an English sailor, and my man Friday,
there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to
Madridiwhen the summer decaying, we hasted to Navarre,
where we were informed, that there was scarcely any pas-
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so that
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluna,
and at last to take a-guide to conduct us safe towards Tou-
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us,
together with their servants, we had a very jolly company.
Away our guide led us by frightful mountains and through
so many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly
passed them, which, as we travelled along, ushered us in-
to the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces of
Languedoc and Gascogoine.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical and co-
mical. First our guide was encountered by three wolves-
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, and wounded
him in three places; upon which my man riding up to
his assistance, shut one of them upon the spot, which
made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasant-
est adventure was to behroldmy man attack the bear. "Ti&
such a creature, that if you let him alone, he never will
meddle with you ; and this my man very well knew, and
so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us " he
"would make good laugh," " Why you silly fool," said Ii
"he'll eat you up at a mouthful." " Eatee me up," re--
plied he by way of scorn " me not only eatee him, but
"make much good laugh." Upon which pulling off his
boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the mon-
strous beast, he called out that he wanted to discourse with
him, and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him,
the beast turns about in fury, and with prodigious strides,
shuffles after him, But though he was not swift enough
M 3
to keep pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were
for help; yet being angry, •' You dog," said I, " inmiedi-
"ately tnke horse and let us shoot the creature." But he
cried, "Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh
"much."' And so he turned about, making signs to follow,
while the bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he
ascended in a minute, leaving his gun at the bottom of
it. Nor did the bear make any difficulty of it, butascended
like a cat, though his weight was very great. You must
consider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my man,
as not perceiving any thing to occasion laughter, till such
times as werode up nearer, and beheld the beast mounted
upon the oak, on the beginning of the same branch, to
Avhich Friday clung at the further end, where the bear
durst not come. Hereupon Friday cried out," Now mas-
"ter, me make much laugh, me make bear dance." Upon
which he fell a shaking the bough, which made the crea-
ture look behind him, to see how he could retreat. Then
as if the bear had understood his stammering English;
"Why you no come farther, Mr. Bear i" said he," pray
"Mr. Bear come further ;"andthen indeed we all burst in-
to laughter, especially when we perceived Friday drop like
a squirrel on the ground, leaving the beast to muke the
best of his way down the tree. And now thinking it the
must convenient time to shoot the creature, Friday cried
out,ll O! dear master no shoot, me shoot by and by;"
when taking up the gun," me no shoot yet, " said he," me
»' make one more much laugh." And accordingly he wasas
good as his word; for the creature descending backwards
from the tree very liesureiy, before he could lay one foot
on the ground, Friday shot him through the ear. stone
dead ; and looking to see whether we were pleased, he
burst out into a hearty laughter, saying," So we kill de
"bear in my country, not with de gun, but with much long
"arrows." Thus ended our diversion, to our great satis-
faction ; especially in a place where the terrible howlings
struck us with a continual terror But the snows now
growing very deep, particularly on the mountains, the rav-
enous creatures were then obliged to seek for sustenance
iathe villages, where co.jing by surprise on the country
people, killed several of them, besides a great number of
their sheep and iiorses.
Our guide told us, that we had yet one more dangerous
I>lace to pass by; and if there were any more wolves in
the country, there we should find them. This was a small
plain, encompassed with woods, to get through a long lane
to the village where we was to lodge. When we entered
the wood, the sun was within half an hour of setting ; and
a little after it was set, we came into the plain, which
was not above two furlongs over, and then we perceived
five great wolves cross the road, without taking notice of
us, and so swift as though they were pursuing after their
prey. Hereupon our guide, believmg there were more
coming, desired us to be upon our guard. Accordingly,
oar eyes were very circumspect, till about hall a league
further, we perceived a dead horse, and about a dozen of
wolves devouring its carcase. My man Friday would fain
have fired at them, but I would not permit him ; nor had
we gone half over the plain, but we heard dreadful howl-
ings in a wood on our left, when presently we saw an hun-
dred come up against us, as tho" they had been an ex-
perienced army. This obliged us to form ourselves in the
best manner; and then I ordered that every oiher man
should fire, that those who did not, might be ready to give
a second volley, should they advance upon us ;and then
every man should make use of his pistol. But there was
no necessity for this ; for the enemy being terrified, stop-
ped at the noise of the fire ; four of them were shot dead,
and several others being wounded, went bleeding away, as
we could very plainly discover by the snow. And now re-
membering what had been often told me, that such was the
majesty of a man's voice, as to strike terror even in the
fiercest creatures, 1 ordered all our companions to halloo
as loud as possible ; and in this notion I was not altogether
mistaken • for they immediately turned about upon the
first halloo, and began to retire, upon which, ordering a se-
cond volley in their rear, ihey galloped into the woods with
great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again,
and then made all the haste we could on our way ; but we
had not rode far, before we were obliged to put ourselves
in a posture of defence as before, being alarmed with a ve-
ry dreadful noise in tl»e Same wood, on our left hand, the
same way as we were to pass, only that it was at some dis-
tance from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to
spread over the elements, and the night growing very dus-
ky,made it so much the moi e to our disadvantage; but still
the noise increasing, we were fully assured, that it was the-
howling and yelling of those ravenous creatures; when
presently three troops of wolves on our front, appeared in
sight, as though a great number of them had a design to
surround us, and devour us in spiteof fate. But as they did
not fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on our jour-
ney in as swift a manner as the roads would permit our
horses, which was only a large trot. It was in this manner
we travelled, till such time as we discovered another
wood, and had the prospect of its entrance through which
we were to pass, at the farthest side of the plain. But sure-
ly none can express the terror we were in, when approach-
ing the lane, we perceived a confused number of the fier-
cest wolves, standing-, as it were, guarding its entrance.
Nor were we long in this amazement, before another oc-
casion of horror presented itself; for suddenly we heard
the report of a gun at another opening in the wood, and
looking that way, out ran ahorse bridled and saddled, fly-
ing with the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen or
seventeen wolves pursuing him, in order to devour the
poor creature ; and unquestionably, they did so, after they
had run him down, not being able to hold out that swift-
ness with which he at first escaped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from whence the
horse came, there lay the carcases of another horse and
two men mangled and torn by these devouring wolves, and
undoubtedly one of these men was the person who fired
the gun which we heard, for the piece lay by him ; but,
alas ! most of the upper part of his body and head were en-
tombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we
could not tell; but it was not long before the wolves made
us to come to a resolution ; for such numbers surrounded
us, every one of whom expected their prey, that were our
bodies to be divided among them, there would not be half
a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it was for us,
that but a little way from the entrance, there lay some ve-
ry large timber-trees, which I supposed had been cut down
and laid there for sale; amongst which I drew my little
troop, placing ourselves in a line behind a long tree, which
served us for a breast work, when desiring them to alight,
we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, closing our bodies
in the centre, the onlyplace where we could preserve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious charge than
what the wolves made upon us in this place; and the sight
of the horses, which was the principal prey they aimed at,
provoked their hunger, and added to their natural fierce-
ness. They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that
made the woods ring again ;(and beginning to mount the
pieces of timber, I ordered every man to fire, as before di-
rected : and indeed,so well did they take their aim,that they
killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but still we
wereobliged to keep a continual firing,by reason they came
on like devils, pushing one another with the greatest fu-
ry. But our second volley something abated their courage,
when stopping a little.we hoped they would have made the
best of their way ; however it did not prove so, for others
made a new attempt upon us ; and though in four firings
we killed seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as
mai;y, yet they several times successively came on, as
though they valued not their lives for the sake of their prey.
Unwilling was I to spend our last shot too suddenly,
and therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a
horn of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the
timber, which he did while Friday was charging my fa-
see and his own with the greatest dexterity. By this time
the wolves coming up the limber, I set fire to the train,
by snapping a discharged pistol close to the powder.
This so scorched and terrified them, that some fell down,
and others jumped in amongst us; but these were im-
mediately dispatched, when all the rest, frightened with
the light, which the darksome night caused to appear
piore dreadful, began at length to retire; upon which,
ordering our last pistols to be fired at once, giving at the
same time a great shout, the wolves were obliged to have
recourse to their swiftness, and turn tail; and then we
sallied out upon twenty lame ones, cutting them in pieces
with our swords, which obliged them 10 howl lamentably,
to the terror of their fellows, who resigned to us the field
as victorious conquerors. And indeed I question whether
Alexander, king of Macedonia, in any of his conquests,
had more occasion for triumph than we had; for he was
but attacked with numerous armies of soldiers; whereas
our army was obliged to combat a legion of devils, as it
were, worse than the cannibals, who the same moment
they had slain us, would have sacrificed us to satisfy their
voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having
threescore of them, and saved our lives from their
fury. We had still a league further to go, when, as we
•went, our ears were saluted with their most unwelcome
howlmgs, ^nd we expected every moment another attack.
But, in an hour's time, we arrived at the town where we
were to lodge; and here we found the place strictly
guarded and all in terrible confusion, as well they might,
for tear of the bears and wolves ore-iking into i.he village,
in order to prey upon their cattle and people. The next
morning \ve were obliged to take a new guide, by reason
the other fell very bad of his wounds, which he had re-
ceived, as before mentioned After we had reached Tou-
louse, we came into a warm, pleasant and fruitful country,
not mtested with wolves, nor any other sort of ravenous
creatures; and when we told our story there, they much
blaming our guide, for conducting us through the forest at
the foot of the mountains, in such a severe season, when
the snow obliged the wolves to seek for shelter in the
woods When we informed them in what manner we
placed ourselves, and the horses in the centre, they ex-
ceedingly reprehended us, and told us, that it was an hun-
dred to one, but we had all been destroyed ; for that it
\vr.s the very sight of the horses, their so much desired
prey, that made the wolves more ragingly fierce than they
would have been, which was evident, by their being at
other times really afraid of a gun . but then being exceed-
ingly hungry, and furious upon that account, their eager-
ness to come at the horses made them insensible of their
danger; and that, if we had not, by a contmual fire and
at last by the cunning stratagem of the train of powder,
got the better of them, it had been great odds if their
number had not overpowered us ; besides, it was a great
mercy that we alighted from our horses, and fought them
with that courage and conduct, which had we failed to do,
every man of us, with our beasts, had been destroyed ; and
indeed this was nothing but truth: for, never in my life
was I so sincerely sensible of danger, as when three hun-
dred devils came roaring upon us, to shun whose unwel-
come company, if I was sure to meet a storm every week,
1 would rather go a thousand leagues by sea. f
I think I have nothing uncommon in my passage thro'
France to take notice of, since other travellers of greater
learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account
than my pen is able to furnish. From Toulouse I travel-
led to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took shipping,

and landed at Dover, the 14th of January, in a very cold
season.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered
my new foontl estate, and all the bills of exchange I had
were -..urremly paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy r.ounsellor,thought no pains nor care too great to pro-
cure my advantage; nor hud I ever occasion to blame
her fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was
foi; leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out for
Lisbon, and so to the Brazils ; but as in the Desolate island
J had some doubts about the Romish religion, so I knew
there was little encouragement to settle there, unless I
apostatized from the orthodox faith, or lived in continual
fear of the inquisition. Upon this account I resolved to
sell my plantation; and for that intent, I wrote to my old
friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my great
satisfaction; which was, that he could sell it to good ac-
count ; however, if I thought it convenient to give him li-
berty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the sur-
-vivors of my trustees, residing at the Brazils, who conse-
quently knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon ihe
spot, and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore
might be the more willing to purchase it: he did not in
the least doubt, but that I should make four or five thou-
sand pieces of eight more of it, than I could, if I disposed
of it in any other manner whatsoever.
You may be sure I could not but agree with this kind
and ingenuous proposal; and immediately I sent him an
order to offer it to them, which he accordingly did ; so that
about ci^ht months after, the ship being in that time re-
turned, he gave me a satisfactory account, that they not
only willingly accepted the offer,but they had also remitted
33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondei.t of their own, at
Lisbon, in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale,ac-
cording to form, which they had sent from Lisbon, and
returned it again to my old friend, he having sent me, for
my estate, bills of three hundred and twenty-eight thousand
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one hundred
moidores per annum, which I had allowed him during life,
likewise fifty to his son durmg life also, accoi'lii,g to my
promise, which the plantation was to make good as a rent
jcharge.

And thus having led my reader to the knowledge of the
first parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculiar
providences that attended it, floating in the ocean of un-
certainty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity,
beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily; nitthinks,
now that I am come to a safe and pleusunt haven, it i*
time to cast out my anchor, and, laying up my vessel, bid
for a while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no other
concerns to look after, but the care of my brother's two
sons, which, with the good widow's persuasions, obliged
me to continue at home seven years. One of these chil-
dren I bred up a gentleman, and the other an experienced
sailor, remarkable for his courage and bravery. Besides
this, I married a virtuous young gentlewoman, of a very
good family, by whom I had two sons and one daughter.
But my dear and tender Wife leaving this earthly stage as
in the second part of my life you will hear) which rent my
soul as it were asunder, my native country became weary
and tiresome to me; and my nephew happening to come
from sea, tempted me to venture another voyage to the
East Indies, which I did in the year 1694, at which time
I visited my island, and informed myself of every thing
that happened since my departure
One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffer-
ed, together with an advanced age, and the fear of losmg,
not only what I had gotten, but my life also, might have
choaked up all the seeds ofyouthful ambition and curiosity,
and put a lasting period to all my wandering inclinations.
But as nothing but death can fully allay the active part of
n»y life, no less remarkable for the many various contingen-
cies of it, you willnextperceive how I visited my little king-
dom, saw my successors the Spaniards, had an account of
the usage they met with from the Englishmen, agreeing
and disagreeing,unitingand separating,till at last they were
subjected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very honor-
ably, together with the wonderful and successful battles
over the Indians who invaded, and thought to have con-
quered the island, but were repelled by their invincible
courage and bravery, having taken eleven men and five
women prisoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I staid
twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary things, as
also a carpenter and smith, and shared the island into parts,
reserving the whole property to myself. Nor will you be

insensible, by the account of these things, of several new
adventures 1 have been engaged in, the battles I have
fought, the deliverances I have met with : and while, in
the surprising relation of such remarkable occurrences, I
shall describe many of God's kindest providences, to me
in particular, no less conspicuous in the same goodness,
power and majesty of our great Creator, shown one way
or other, over the face of the earth, if duly adverted to.

WHEN we consider the puissant force of Nature, and
•what mighty influence it has many times over the temper,
of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to think, that
my powerful reason should be overcome by a much
stronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran conti-
nually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in
the night: nay, I made it the continual subject of my talk,
even to impertinence, when I was awake. I had such va-
pours in my head, that I actually supposed myself at my
castle; that I not only perceived Friday's father, the old
Spaniard, and the wicked sailors, but that I talked and dis-
coursed with them about their manner of living; that I
heard the things related to me, which I found afterwards
to be too true ; and that I executed my judgment with the
greatest severity upon the offenders. And indeed, this an-
ticipating all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely affor.d-
ed me one pleasant hour : my dear and tender wife could
not but take notice of it, which drew these affectionate
speeches from her: " My dear," said she," I am really
"persuaded that some secret impulse from Heaven occa-
11 sions in you a determination to see the island again : nor
"am I less sensible, but your being engaged to me and
"these dear children, is the only hindrance of your depar-
"ture. I know, my dear, if I were in the grave, you would
- " not long continue at home ; prevent not your happiness
"on my account, whose only comfort centres in you- All
"thut 1 can object is that such an hazardous undertaking
"is no way consistent with a person of your years ; but if
"you are resolved to go," added she, weeping," only per-
"• mil me to bear you company, and that is all I desire.''
Such endearing tenderness, graced with the most inno-
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensi-
bly into my right understanding ; and when I considered
all the transactions of my fife, and particularly my new en-
gagement ; that I had now one child already born, and my
wife big of another ; and that I had no occasion to seek
for more riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency,
with much struggling 1 altered my resolution at last, re-
solving to apply myself to some business or other, which t
might put a period to such wandering inclinations. Here-'
upon I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, with
a resolution to move thither; upon this there was a pretty
convenient house, surrounded with land, very capable of
improvement, which suited my temper, as to planting,
managing, and cultivating. Nor was I long before. I en-
tered upon my new settlement, having bought ploughs,
harrows, cans, waggons, horses, cows and sheep ; so that
I now led the life of a country gentleman, and as happy
m my retirement as the greatest monarch in the world.
And what made me think my happiness the greater was,
that I was in the middle state of life, which my father so
often recommended, much resembling the felicity of a ru-
ral retirement, which is elegantly described by the poet
in these lines:
Free from all vices,freejrom care,
Age has no fiain, and youth no snare.
But in the midst of this my happiness, I was suddenly
plunged in the greatest sorrow that I could possibly en-
dure ; for when I least expected it, my dear and tender wile
was forced to submit to the irresistible power of Death,
leaving this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for
me to express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness ot
her person; neither can I too much lament her loss., which
my last breath shall record ; her influence was greater
over me than the powers of my own reason, the importuni-
ties of friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting
tears of a tender and disconsolate mother ; in a word, she.
was the spirit of all my affairs, and the centre of my enter--
prizes. But now, since the cruel hand of Death had closed
my dearest's eyes,I seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the
world ; my privy counsellor being gone, I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind. And
when I looked around me in this bu»y world, one part hi-
bouring for bread, and the other squandering away their
estates ; this put me in mind how I had lived in my little
kingdom, where both reason and religion dictated to me,
that there was something that certainly was the reason and
end oflife, which was far superior to what could be hoped
for on this side the grave. My country delights were now
as insipid and dull, as music and science to those who have
neither taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave
off house-keeping, L left my farm, and in a few months re-
turned to London.
But neither could that great city, so famous for its va--
tiety of entertainment, afford me any agreeable delight;
a state of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and
most hurtful to body and soul. It was now the beginning.
of the year 1684, at which time my nephew (who, as L
before observed had been brought up to the sea, and ad-
vanced to be Captain of a ship) was returned from a short
voyage to Bilboa, the first he had made in that station.
He comes to me one morning, telling me that some mer-
chants of his acquaintance had persuaded him to go a
voyage for them to the East Indies and China, 'in the;
manner of private traders; "and now, uncle," said hey
"if you'll accompany me thither, I'll engage to land you
"upon your old island, to visit the state of your little
"kingdom.''
Just before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to gef
a patent for its possession, and then to fill it with inhabi-
tants. After I had paused a while, and looked stedfastly
on him, " What Devil, or spirit," said I, " sent you with
"this unlucky errand ?" He started at first; but recovering-
himself when he perceived I was not offended : " Sir,"re-
plied he, what I have proposed cannot, 1 hope, be styled
unlucky, since certainly you must be desirous to see your
little territory, where you reigned with more content than
any of your brother kings in the universe.''i—" Nephew,"
said I, " if you will leave me there, and call far me as you
come back, I care not if I give my consent:" but he an-
swered, that the merchants would not allow their vessel,.
loaded with an infinite value, to return there again, which
was a month's sail out of the way-; " besides, Sir," said
'he. luf I should miscarry, was your request granted, why
"then you would be locked up as before." This, indeed
carried a great deal of reason in it; but we found out a re-
Medy, and that was to carry a framed sloop on board, rea-
N S .
dy to be set up in the island, by the ass'Stance of some
carpenters which we should carry with us, t: at might be
fitted in a few days to go to sea. I was not long in form-
ing my resolution, which overswayed my good friend the
widows' persuasions, and the natural affection I bore, to
my young children. I made my will, and settled my es-
tate in such a manner, that I was perfectly sure my poor in-
fants would have justice done them. The good widow not
only undertook to make provision for my voyage, but also,
took the charge of my domestic affairs, and to provide for
my children's education ; and indeed no mother could take
more care, or understood that office better : for which I
lived to reward and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being
ready to sail, I and Friday went on board in the Downs on.
the 8th, having besides that sloop already mentioned, a
very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I had
some servants, whom I purposed to leave there, as they
should appear willing; there were two carpenteVs, a smith
and a very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-all-trades;
for he was not only a cooper bytrade, bulalso he was dex*
trous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, like-
-.vise a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I also carried'
a tailor, who consented to stay on my plantation, and pro-
ved a most necessary fellow in the island. As to my car-
go, it consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and Eng-
lish stuffs for cloathing the Spaniards that L expected to
find there ; as likewise gloves, hats, shoes and stockings;
together with beds, bedding, and household stuffs, especial-
ly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &,<:.
also nails, tools of all sorts, staples, hooks, hinges, and all
other things necessary; all which I think, cost me about
three hundred pounds. Nor was this all ; for I.carried an
hundred spare arms, muskets and fusees, besides some
pistols, a considerable quantity of several sows of shot, two
brass cannon, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part
of some pikes and halberts. I made my nephew take with
us two small quarter-deck guns, more than he had occa-
sion for in his ship, to leave behind, if there was a neces-
sity ; so that we might build a fort there, and man it against
all opposers whatsoever.
Well, we put 10 sea; and though I oan't say this voy-
age was so unprosperousas my others bad been, yet con-
iray winds drove us so far norUwardj that we were oblig-
edto put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two and twenty days. Here indeed our provisions
were very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores, by
taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which I then
resolved to put on shore in my island, if our necessities
did not call for them. On the 5th of February, we sailed
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some
days ; and I think it was about the 20th of the same month
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, that he
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired : and when he
was speaking, a boy came in, and told us that the boat-
swain had heard another. Upon which we all ran to the
quarter-deck, from whence, in a few moments, we per-
ceived a terrible fire at a distance. We had immediately
recourse to our reckonings, in which we were all of opinion
that there could be no land that way, it appearing to be at
N. N. W. Hereupon we concluded that some ship had
taken fire at sea, and that it could not be.far off, by the re-
port of the guns which we had heard. We made up di-
rectly to it, and in half an hour's time, the wind being fair,
we could plainly perceive a great ship on fire in the middle
of the ocean. Touched with this unhappy disaster, and
considering my former circumstances, when the Portu.
guese captain took me up, I ordered immediately five guns
to be fired, that the poor creatures, not seeing us, it being
dark (though we could perceive their flame) might be
sensible there was deliverance at hand, and consequently
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat. Nor
was it long before the ship blew, up in the air, and the fire
•was extinguished in the ocean. But supposing them all to
be in their boats we hung out our lanterns, and kept firing
till eight o'clock in the morning ; when, with our perspec-
tives, we beheld two boats full of people, making towards
us, tho' the tide was against them; then spreading out
our ancienti and hanging out a waft, as a signal for them
to come on board, in half an hour's time we came up to
them, and took them all in, there being no less than sixty-
four men, women, and children. It was a French mer-
chant ship of three hundred tons, homeward-bound from
Quebec in the river of Canada. The master informed me
hovr, by the negligence of the steersman, the steerage
\?as set on fire: that at his outcry for help, the fire wag
as we thought totally extinguished: but chat some sparks
getting between the timber, and within the ceiling, it pro-
ceeded into the hold, wheie there was no resisting it; and'
then they got into their boats, as creatures in the last ex-
tremity, with what provision thy had, together with oars
sails and a compass, intending to go back to Newfound-
land, the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though there
were several chances against them, as storms to overset
and founder them, rains and-colds to benumb and perish
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and
starve them ; but, said he, in this our great distress, we
heard the welcome report of your guns, when with un-
speakable joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were
resolved to lie by till morning; but perceiving your light,
we set our oars to work, to keep our boat a-head, the soon-
er to attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deli-
verance.
Indeed no one can express the joy of these pot»; crea-
tures on this occasion ; fear andgriet arc easily set forth;
sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head,
are all the demonstrations of these passions ; but an excess
of joy carries in it a thousand extravagancies ; especially,
I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be
more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay than tha> of
other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in
the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad
about the ship, while the rest were stamping with their feet,
wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away,
vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to
the Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think, if I am
not mistaken, our surgeon let thirty of them blood But
among the passengers, there were two priests, the one an
old, and the other a young man ; but what amazed me
more was, that the oldest was in the worst plight; for no
sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he
dropt down as it were without life, and to every one's ap-
pearance quite dead ; but the surgeon chafmg and rubbing
his arm. opened a vein, which at first dropped, and then
flowing more freely, the old mun began to open his eyes,
and in a quarter of an hour was well again But soon re-
membering this happy change, the joy of which whirled
his blood about faster than the vessels could convey-it, he
became so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than
any other place ; but the surgeon giving nim a. sleepy
dose, he was perfectly composed the next morning.
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on his
face in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I
thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to
help him up ; but he modestly told me, he was returning
his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a
few moments, and that, next to his Creator, he would re-
turn me thanks also. And indeed he did so about three
minutes after with great seriousness, and affection, while
the tears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the
gratitude of his soul. Nor did he less show his pity and
wisdom in applying himself *.o his country people, and
labouring to compose them,by the most powerful reasons,
arguments and persuasions. And when, indeed, these
people had taken their night's repose, in such lodgings as
our ship would allow, we found nothing but the best of
manners, and the most civil acknowledgments, for which
the French are eminently remarkable. The next day the
Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me
and my nephew the commander. They told us, that they
had saved some money and valuable things out of the ru-
ined vessel, which was at our service ; only that they de-
sired to be set on shore some where in our way. At the
first my nephew was for accepting the money ; but I (who
knew how hard my case would have been, had the Portu-
guese Captain served me so) persuaded him to the con-
trary; and therefore told them, that as we have done no-
thing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and hu-
inanity, and what we ourselves might expect from others
in such calamity; so we took them up to save them, not
to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land, to
perish for want of subsistence, and therefore would not
accept their money: but as to landing them, that was a
great difficulty ; for being bound to the East Indies, it was
impossible wilfully to change our voyage upon their par-
ticular account, nor could my nephew (who was under
charter-party to pursue it by way of Brazil) answer ii to
the freighters. All that we could do, was to put ourselves
in the way of meeting some ships homeward bound from
the West Indies, that, if possible, they might get a pas-
sage to France or England. Indeed, they were very thank-
ful for our first kindness ; but were under great concern,
especially the passengers, at their bemg carried to the
East Indies. They?begged, therefore, I would keep on
the banks of Newfoundland, where probably they might
meet with some ship, or sloop, to carry them to Canada,
whence they came. As this was but a reasonable requestr
J was inclined to grant it, since it was no breach of char-
ter-party, and that the laws of God and nature obliged us
to do what good we could to our fellow-creatures ; and be-
sides the danger we ourselves would be in forwant of pro-
visions ; so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland,
if wind and weather would permit; if not, that we should
carry them to Martinico in the West Indies. But, as it
happened, in a week's time we made the banks of New-
foundland, where the French people hired a bark to carry
them to France. But the young priest being desirous lo-
go to the East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because 1 lik-
ed his conversation, and two or three of the French sail-
ors also entered themselves on board our ship.
Now, directing our course forthe West Indies, steering-
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano-
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th of March
1694-5; we perceived a sail (our course S. E. and by S.)
•which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large
vessel, having lost her main top-mast and bowsprit : when
firing a gun as a signal of distress, wind N. N. W. we soon
came to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol,
bound home from Barbadoes, out of which road she had
been forced in a hurricane to the westward, in which they
lost their masts. »
They told us, their expectations were to see the Bahama:
Islands, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N.
W and having no sail to work the ship with, but the main-
course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast,
because they could not come near the land, where endea-
vouring to stand fortl>e Canaries : nay, what was worse,be-
sides all their faiigue, they were almost starved for want
of provision, having ate nothing for eleven days ; all that
they had a board was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and'
seven casks of rum. In this ship were pasengers, a youth,
his mother, and a maid-servant, who were in a most de-
plorable condition for want of food. If I had not gone on
board their ship, the knowledge of their misery had been
concealed from me, and Uiey would have inevitably perish-
ed ; though, indeed, their second mate who was Captain,
by reason the true Captain was not on board when the
•fcurricane happened, had before informed me that there
•were such persons on board, whom he supposed to be .
dead, being afraid to inquire after them, because he had
nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we resolved
to let them have what we could spare, ordering the mate
to bring some of his men on board us, which he did accord-
ingly : as he and they looked like skeletons, when meat
was set before them, I ordered them to eat sparingly.
But, however, they soon fell sick; which obliged the sur-
geon to mix something in their broth, which was to be to
them, both food and physic. When they were fed, we or-
dered our mate to carry them a sack of bread, and four or
five pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged them to see
it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook-room, to pre-
vent the men from eating it raw, and consequently killing,
themselves with what was designed tor their relief. But
particularly, I desired the mate to see what condition the
poor passengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a
pitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the
men. And being curious to see this scene of misery my-
self, I took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship)
in our own boat, and sailed after them.
Here was a sad sight indeed ! scarce were the victuals
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break open
the cook-room door. To stay their stomachs the mate
gave them biscuits, which were dipped in and softened
with the liquor of the meat, which they called bruise ,• tel-
ling them, it was for their own safety, that he was obliged
to give them but a little at a time; -and so feeding them
gradually, their bellies were comfortably iiHed,and the men
• did very well again. But when they came to the poor gen-
tlewoman in the cabin, who for several days h»d continued,
without food, giving what she had to her soBjjTthey found
her as it were in the arms of death. She was sitting upon,
the floor of the deck, with her back against the sides, be-
tween two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head
shrunk between her shoulders, like a senseless corpse.
Nothing was wanting in my mate to revive her and en-
courage her ; opening her lips, and putting some broth in
her mouth with a. spoon. But not having strength to speak,
she lifted up her head with much difficulty intimating that
it was now too late ! at ;he same time pointing to the youth
her son, as though she desired him to do what he could to
save the lad, and in a little time after, she died.
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretched
out on a cabin bed, like one that had scarce any life. In
his mouth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which
he had ate up. At first he vomited what the mate had given
him; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in the
greatest concern for the death of his tender mother.
As to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress, like one
in the last pangs of death: her limbs were distorted, one
of her hands was claxped round the frame of a chair, which
she grasped so hard, that it was with some difficulty we
separated her from it; her other arm lay over her head,
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame
of the cabin table ; not only being starved with hunger,
but overcome with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom
she loved most tenderly. It was a great while before the
surgeon could bring her to life, and a much longer time
before she came to her senses- :.
After we had sailed with them some days, we sent them
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit,
with peas, flour, and other things: takingthreccasks of
sugar, some ram, and some pieces of eight as payment,
we left them, but took the youth and maid with us, with-
all their goods The lad was about seventeen years old,
very handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but migh-
tily concerned for the loss of his honored mother, hav-
ing lost his father at Barbadoes but a few months before.
He beseeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take
him out of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing a
small sustenance, had starved his mother. But hunger
has no bounds, no right, and consequently is incapable of
any compassion. When the surgeon told him, our voy-
age might put him in bad circumstances, and farther from
his friends, he said he did not care, if he was delivered
from that terrible crew; that as the Captain (meaning me)
had saved him from death, so he was sure he would do
him no harm ; and, as for the maid, when she was restor-
ed to her senses, she would be no less thankful, let us car-
ry them were we would. And indeed the surgeon so
represented their case to me, that I consented, and took
them on board with all their goods, except eleven hogs-
heads of sugar; but the youth having a bill of lading, I
made the commander oblige himself to deliver a letter
and the deceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers, a mer-
chant in Bristol; but I believe the ship as lost at stfs*
for we never could hear what became of her afterwards.
We were now in the latitude 19 dog. 32 min. having as
yet a tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several lit-
tle incidents 'relating to wind and weather, I shall relate
what is most remarkable concerning my little kingdom, to
which I was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in
finding- it, for as I came to, and went from it before, on the
fcputh and east side of the island, as coming from the Bra-
zils, so now approaching between the main and the island,,
not having any chart for the coast, nor land mark, it oblig-
ed us to go on shore on several islands in the mouth of the
river Oroonoko, but to no purpose. Thus I perceived, that
what I thought was a continent before, was no such thing,
but a long island, or rather a ridge of sands. On one of
these islands I found some Spaniards, but they belonged to
the Isle de Trinidad, who came hither in a sloop to'make
salt, and try to find some pearl muscles. But at length I
came fair on the south-side of my island, and then I present-
ly knew the countenance of my little kifigdom: so we
brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside within the
creek, where stood my ancient and venerable castle.
$To sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I
asked him where he was ? but when he looked a little, he
clapped his hands, crying, " Q joy, O there, O yes, O
"there !" pointing to our old abode, and then fell a dancing
and capering as if he was mad, and I had much ado to
keep him from jumping into the sea, 'to swim ashore.
"Friday," said I, " what do you think, shall we go see'
"your father ?" At the mentioning his father's name, the
poor affectionate creature fell a weeping: " No, no," says
he, " me see him no more, never see poor father more ! he
*' long ago die, die long ago, he much -old man." " You
don't know that," said I," but shall we see any body else?"
He looks about, and pomting to the hill above my house
cries out, " We see, we see there much men and there:"
which, though I could not perceive them with my perspec-
tive glass, was true, by what the men themselves told me
the next day.
When the English ancient was spread, and three guns
fired as a signal of friendship, we perceived a smoke rise
from the creek ; upon which I ordered the boat out, taking
Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce, I
went on shore, accompanied also by the young friar, to
whom I had related the history of the first part of my life;
O
besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in case we had
met with any opposition.
After we h«d rowed directly into the creek, the first
man I fixed my eyes upon, was the Spaniard, whose life I
had saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew. I order-
ed them all to stay in the boat for a while; but Friday,
perceiving his father at a distance, would have jumped in-
to the sea, had they not let the boat go No sooner was
he on shore, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a how to
embrace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man
of the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to see with
what uncommon transports of joy he saluted him • he first
kissed him, then stroked his face, took him in his arms, laid
him under a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as
earnestly at him as one could do at a picture, for a quarter
of an hour together. After this he would lie upon the
ground, stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare
at him as though he was bewitched ; but the next day one
could notforbear laughterto see his behaviour, forhe would
walk several hours with his father along the shore,leading
him by the hand, as tho' he was a lady ; while every now
and then, he would run to the boat to get something for
him, as a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit or something or
other that was good. His frolics ran in anoiher channel in
the afternoon ; when he set old Friday on the ground he
would dance around him, making comical postures and
gestures ; and all this while would be telling him one story
or another of his travels and adventures.
It was on the 10th of April, anno 1695, that I set my
foot upon the island a second time When my faithful
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat,
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him.
"Seignior,"said 1, m Portuguese," do you not know me?"
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his at-
tendapt, extended his arms, and saying something in Spa-
nish that I did not then understand, he came forward and
embraced me, saying he was inexcusable not to know his
deliverer; who, like an angel sent from heaven, had saved
his life. He then beckoned to the man to call out liis
companions, asking me if I would walk to my own habi-
tation- and take possession, where I should find soii'e mean
improvements ; ',u: mdeed they were extraordinary ones;
for they had planted so many trees so close together,
that the place was like a labyrinth, which none could find
out except themselves, who knew his intricate windings.
I asked him the meaning of all these fortifications ? he told
me he would give a large account of what had passed
since my departure to this time, and how he had subdued
some English, who thought to be their murderers, hoping
I would not be displeased, since necessity compelled them
to it. As I knew they were wicked villians, so I told him,
that I was not only far from finding fault with it, but was
rather heartily glad that they had subdued them. While
we were thus talking, the man whom he sent returned,
accompanied by eleven more, but in such habits, that It
was impossible to tell what nation they were of. He first
turned to me, and pointing to them, " These, Sir,"said he,
"are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to your
'* goodness ;" then turning to them, and pointing to me,he
made them sensible who I was ; and then indeed they
saluted me one by one, not as ordinary men, but as though
they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a triumph-
ant conqueror; for their behaviour not only agreed with
a manlike, majestic gravity, but at the same time was so
obliging and courteous, as made them agreeable to the last
degree.
Before I relate the history of the transactions of my
kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, I
must here insert what I omitted in my former relation.
The matter is this; Just before we weighed anchor and
set sail there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which
had like to have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time
as the courageous Captain, taking two of the most refrac-
tory prisoners, laid them in irons, threatening, as they
were concerned in the lormer disorders, to have them
hanged in England for running away with the ship. This
frightened some of the rest, as thinking the Captain would
serve them in the same manner, though he seemed to give
them good words for the present. But the mate having*
intelligence of this, made me acquainted with their fears;
so that, to make them more easy, and ourselves more safe
from their conspiracies. 1 was obliged tn go down, and pass
my honor's word for it, that upon their good behaviour,
all that was past should be forgiven them ; in testimony of
which, I ordered the two men's irons to be taken off, and
thernselves forgiven. But as this had brought us to an
anchor that night, in which there was a calm ; the two men
that had been in irons stole each of them a musket, and
.•. . - . >• „
some other weapons, and taking the ship's pinnace, not
yet hauled up, runaway to theirbrother rogues. The next
morning we sent the long boat with men to pursue them,
but all in vain; the mate in revenge, would have demol-
ished my little castle, burnt its furniture, and destroyed
their plantations, but having no orders for it, he did not put
it in execution. And thus there were five Englishmen in
the island, which caused great differences, as my faithful
Spaniard gave me a perfect account of, in the following
manner:
"You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you sent
me about, and M'hat a disappointment we met with by your
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the
relation of all our voyage, being blessed with- calm wea-
ther und a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my
countrymen to see me alive, having acted as the principal
man on board, the Captam of the shipwrecked vessel dying
before; nor was their surprise less, as knowing I was taken
prisoner by the savages of another nation, they had thought
me long since entombed in their monstrous bowels. But
•when I showed them the arms, ammunition, and provi-
sions I had brought for them, they looked upon me as a
second Joseph, advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immedi-
ately prepared to come along with me. Indeed they were
obliged to trespass upon their friendl savages, by borrow-
ing two of their canoes, under a pretext for fishing ; and
they came away the next morning, but without any pro-
visions of their own, except a few roots, which served
them instead of bread. After three weeks absence, we ar-
rived at our habitation. Here we met with three English
sailors, who, I confess, gave uS provisions, a'nd that letter
of direction you had left us, which informed us how to
bring up tame goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots,
and in short, every thing that was necessary for our use.
As, in particular, I knew your method best, so taking
Friday's father to assist me, we managed all the affairs;
nor were the rest of the Spaniards wanting in their kind
offices, dressing food for the Englishmen, who did nothing
but ramble and divert themselves in the woods, either
shooting parrots, or catching tortoises. But we had not
been long ashore, before we were informed of two more
Englishmen, unnaturally turned out of their common place
of residence, by the three others above mentioned; this
made my Spaniards and, me (whqm they now looked upon
as their governor in your absence) endeavour to persuade
them to take them in, that we might be as one family;
but all our entreaties were in vain, so thut the poor fellows
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their
tents on the north side of the island, a little inclining to the
west, for fear of savages. Here they built two huts, one
to lodge, and the other to lay their stores in : for my good
natured Spaniards giving them some seed they dug and
planted as 1 had done, and began to live prettily. But
while they were thus comfortably going on, the three un-
natural brutes, their countrymen, in a mere bullying hu-
mor, insulted them, by saying, the governor (meaning
you) had given them possession of the island, and d—n>
'em they should build no houses upon their ground, with-
out paying rent. The two honest men (for so let me now
distinguish them) thought their three countrymen only
jested, and one of them invited them in, to see their fine
habitations; while the other facetiously told them, that
since they built the tenements with great improvements,
they should according to the custom of lords, give them a.
longer lease ; at the same time desiring them to fetch a
scrivener to draw the writings. One of these wretches
swearing he should pay for the jest,snatches up a fire brand,
and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very fairly set
it on fire, which would soon have consumed it, had not the-
honest man thursi him away, and trod it out with his feet,
Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole, with which he
•would have ended' his days, and not the poor man avoided
the blow,-when fetching his musket, he knocked down the-
villain that began the quarrel. The other two coming to-
assist their fellow, obliged the other honest man to take hiu
musket also, and both of them presenting their pieces, bid:
the villains stand off; and if they did not lay down their
arms death should decide the dispute one way or other.
This brought them to a parley, in which they agreed to-
take their wounded man and be gone; but they were in
the wrong that they did not disarm them when they had'
the power, and then make their com plaint to me and my
Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented their
farther designs against them. And indeed so many tres-
passes did they afterwards commit,by treading down their
corn, shooting their young kids and goats, and plaguing',
them night and day, that they resolved to come to my
castle, challenge all the three, and decide, their right by
O 2
one plain battle, while the Sp iards stood by to see fair
play.
One day it happened, that two of my Spaniards (one
of whom understood English) being in the woods, were
met by one of the honest men, who complained how bar-
barous their countrymen had been in destroying their corn,
killing their milk-goat and three kids, which deprived
them ot their subsistence; and that if we did not grant
them relief, they must be inevitably starved, and so they
parted ; but when my Spaniards came home at night, and
supper being on the table, one of them began to repre-
hend the Englishmen, but in a very mannerly way; which
ihey resenting, replied, " What business had their coun-
"try men in that place without leave, when it was none of
"their ground ?" " Why,"said my Spaniard calmly, Ingli-
"*e, they must not starve :" but they replied," Let them
« starve and be damn'd,they should neither plant nor build;
"and d—n them, they should be their servants, and work
"for them, for the island was theirs, and they would burn
"all the huts they should find in the island" "By this
"rule," said my Spaniard, smiling, " We shall be your
"servants too." " Aye, by G-d, and so you shall," repli-
ed the impudent rascal. Upon which, starting up, Will
Atkins cries, " Come Jack, U-t's have t'other brush with
"them; who dare to build in our dominions?" Thus
leaving us something heated with just passion, away they
trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and sword, mut-
tering some threatening words, that we could'then but im-
perfectly understand That night they designed t0 mur-
der their two companions, and slept till midnight in the
bower, thinking to fall upon them in their sleep ; nor were
the honest men less thoughtful concerning them ; for at
this juncture they were coming to find them out, but in a
much fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the
huts and found no body there, they concluded that 1 and
my Spaniards had given them notice, and therefore swore
to be revenged on us. Then they demolished the poor
men's habitations: not by fire, as they attempted before,
but pulled down their houses, limb from limb, not leaving
stick nor stone on the ground where they stood, broke
their household stuff in pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled
their inclosures, and in short, quite ruined them of every
thmg they had. Had these people met together, i;o doubt
but there would have been a bloody battle; but Providence
ordered it for the better; for just us the three were got to-
gether the two were at our castle ; and when they left us,
the three came back again, but in a great rage, scoffingly
telling us what they had done ; when one taking hold of a
Spaniard's hat, twirls it round, saying,"And you Seignior
"Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you don't
"mend your manners." My Spaniard, a grave but cour-
ageous man, knocked him down with one blow of his fist;
at which another villain fired his pistol, and narrowly mis-
sed his body, but wounded him a little in the ear. Hereat
enraged, the Spaniard takes up the fellow's musket whom
he had knocked down, and would have shot him, if I and
the rest had not come out and taken their arms from eve-
ry one of them.
"These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us
their enemies, began to cool; but notwithstanding their
better words, the Spaniards would not return them their
arms again, telling them, they would do them no manner
of harm, if they would live peaceably ; but if they offered
Any injury to the plantation or castle, they would shoot
them as they would do ravenous beasts. This made them
so mad, that they went away raging like furies of hell.
They were no sooner gone, but in came the two honest
men, fired with the justest rage if such can be, having
been ruined as aforesaid. And indeed it was very hard,
that nineteen of us should be bullied by three villains, con-
tinually offending with impunity.
"It was a great while. Sir, before we could persuade the
two Englishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly killing
them with their fire-arms; but we promised them justice
should be done them, and in the mean time, they should
reside with us in our habitation. In about five days after,
these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near
our grove,and perceiving me, the governor, and two others
walking by the side of the creek, they very submissively
desired to be received into the family again. We told
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural
barbarity to their countrymen : but yet we would see what
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour's tirtie would bring
them word. After some debate, we called them in, where
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them,
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, which
they could not deny. But here 1 was forced to interpose
as a mediator,by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt
them, being naked and unarmed, and that the other threflr
should ID Ac them restitution, by building their two huts,
and fencing their ground in the same manner as it was be-
fore. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submit-
ted 'o this at present,and lived some time regularly enough
except as to the working part, which they did not care
for but the Spaniards would have dispensed with ih.it, had
they contmued easy and quiet. Their arms being given:
them agam, they scarce had them a week, when they be-
came as troublesome as ever ; but an accident happening-
soon after, obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and
look to our common preservation.
"One night, Sir. 1 went to bed, perfectly well in health,
and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep ;•
upon which, being very uneasy, I got up and looked out,
but it being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees
around the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all
one I could not sleep; when one of my Spaniards, hear-
ing me walk about, asked who it was up' 1 answered," It
u K I" When I told him the occasion,,kSir ', said he," such
"things are not to be slighted, for certainly there is some
"mischief plotting against us."" Where are the English-
"men ?" said I. He answered," In their huts ; for they lay
•'separate from us, Sir, since the last mutiny."" Well,"
said I." some kind spirit gives thrs information for advan-
M tage Come, let us go abroad, and see if any thing offers to
"justify our fears" Upon which I and some of my Span-
iards went up the mountain, not by the ladder, but through
the grove, and then we were struck with a panic fear on see-
ing a light, as though it were a fire, at <t very little distance,
and hearing the voices of several men. Hereupon we re-
treated immediately, and raised the rest of our forces, and
made them sensible of the impending danger; but with all
my authority, I could not make them stay where they
•were, so earnest were they to see how thing went Indeed
the darkness of the night gave- them opportunity enough
to view them by the light of the fire undiscovered. As they
were in different parties, and straggling over the shore, we
•were much afraid that they should find out our habitations,
and destroy our flocks of goats, to prevent which, we sent
immediately an Englishman and two Spaniards to drive
the goats into the valley where the cave lay; or, if there
•was occasion, into the cave itself: Ab to ourselves, re-
suming our native courage and prudent comhiet, had wo
not been divided, we durst venture to attack an hundred of
them ; but before it •was very light, we resolved to send
out Friday's father as a spy, who, immediately stripping
himself naked, gets among them undiscovered, and in two
hours time brings word, that they were two parties of two
different nations, who lately having a bloody battle with
one another, happened to land by mere chance in the same
island, to devour their miserable prisoners ; that they were
entirely ignorant of any person's inhabiting here ; but ra-
ther being filled with rage and fury against each other,
he believed, that as soon as day-light appeared, there would
be^a terrible engagement. Old Friday had scarcely ended
his relation, when we heard an uncommon noise, and per-
ceived that there was a horrid engagement between the
two armies.
"Such was the curiosity of our party, especially the
Englishmen, that they would not lie close, tho' old Friday
told them their safety depended upon it; and that if we
had patience, we should behold these savages kill one ano-
ther. However they used some caution, by going farther
into the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient
plucu to.behold the battle.
"Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or
men of more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac-
cording to their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near
two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle be-
gan to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors.
We were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on
this account, lest they should run into our grove, and con-
sequently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and
that too with our swords, and the butt end of our muskets,
for fear the report of our guns should be heard
"And so, indeed, as we thought, it happened ; for three
of the vanquished army crossing the creek, ran directly to
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter; nor was it long
before our scout gave us notice of it; as also, that the
victors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon this, I
•would not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised
and taken by our party; afterwards they proved very good
servants to us, being stout young creatures, and able to
do a great deal of work. The remainder of the conquered
savages fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean,
while the conquerors, joining together, shouted by way
of triumph, and about three in the afternoon they also em-
barked for their own nation. Thus we were freed at once
from these savages and our fears, not perceiving any one
of these creatures for some considerable time after. We
found two and thirty men dead in the field of battle ; some
were slain with long arrows, which we found sticking in
their bodies ; and the rest were slain with great unweildy
wooden swords, which denoted their vast strength, and of
which we found seventeen, besides bows and arrows: but
we con Uf not find one wounded creature among them alive;
for they either kill their enemies quite, or carry those
wounded awuy with them.
"This terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for some
time, considering how unfortunate they might have been
had they fallen into their hands, who would not only kill
them as enemies, but also for food, as we do cattle; and
indeed so much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it
not only made them sick, but more tractable to the com-
mon necessary business of the whole society, planting!
sowing and reaping, with the greatest signs of amity and
friendship; so that being now all good friends, we began
to consider of circumstances in general ; and the first thing
we thought of was, whether, as we perceived the savages
haunted that side of the island, and there being more re-
tired parts of it, and yet as well suited to our manner of
living, and equally to our advantage, we ought not rather
to move our place of residence, and plant it in a much
safer place, both for the security of our corn, and preser-
vation of our cattle.
"After a long debate on this head, it was resolved, or
rather voted, nemine contra dicente, not to remove our an-
cient castle, and that for this very good reason, that some
time or other we expected to hear from our supreme Gov-
ernor (meaning you Sir,} whose messengers not finding
us there, might think the' place demolished, and all his
subjects destroyed by savages.
"As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle,
we consented to have them removed to the valley where
the cave was, that being most proper, and sufficient for
both. Bui yet, when we considered farther, we altered
one part of our resolution, which was to remove part of our
cattle thither, and only plant part of our corn there ; so that
in case one part was destroyed, the other might be pre-
served. Another resolution we took, which really had *
great deal of produce in it; and that was, in not trusting
the three savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any
knowledge of the plantations we had made in the valley,
of what number of cattle we had there, much less of ihe
cave, wherein we kept several arms, and two barrels of
powder you left for us at your departure from .this island.
But though we could not change our habitation, we resolv-
ed to make it mo-e fortified and more secret. To this end,
Sir, as you planted trees at some distance before the en-
trance of your palace, so we, imitating your example,
planted and filled up the whole space of ground, even to
the banks of the creek, nay, into the very ooze where the
tide flowed, not leaving a place for landing; and among
those I had planted, they inter> singled so many short ones,
all of which growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog
could scarcely find a passage through them. Nor was this
sufficient, as we thought, for we did the same to all the
ground, on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of
the hill, witiiout so much as leaving a passage fur our-
selves, except by the.ladder ; which being taken down, no-
thing but what had wings or witchcraft, could pretend to
come near us. And indeed this was exceedingly well
contrived, especially to serve that occasion, for which we
afterwards found it necessary.
"Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav-
ing all this time not one visit from the savages. Indeed
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some a-
mazement; for a few of my Spaniards being out very ear-
ly, perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were com-
ing on shore ; upon which returning home with great pre-
cipitation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to
keep at home all that day and the next, going out only in
the night time to make our observations; but as good luck
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not
land that time upon the island.
"But now there happened another quarrel between the
three wicked Englishmen, and some of my Spaniards
The occasion was this : One of them being enraged at one
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not being
able to comprehend something which he was showing him,
watched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but
to kill him; yet missmg his head, gave him such a bar-
barous cut in the shoulder, that he had like to have struck
oS his arm; at which one of my good natured Spaniards
interposing between the Englishman and the savage, be-
seeched the former not to murder the poor creature; but
this kindness had like to have cost the Spaniard his life,
for the Englishman struck at him in the same manner;
which he nimbly and wisely avoiding, returned upon him
suddenly with his shovel (being all at work about their
corn land) and very fairly knocked the brutish creature
down. Hereupon another Englishman coming to his as-
sistance, laid the good Spaniard on the earth; when im-
mediately two others coming to his relief, were attacked
by the third Englishman, armed with an old cutlass, who
wounded them both. This uproar soon reached our ears,
when we rushing out upon them, took the three English-
men prisoners, and then tnir next question was, what we
should do with such mutinous and impudent fellows, so
furious, desperate and idle, that they were mischievous to
the highest degree, and consequently not safe for the so-
ciety to let them live among them.
"Now Sir, as I was Governor in your absence, so I al-
so took the authority of a judge; and having them bro't
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my coun-
try, I would have hanged every mother's son of them:
but since it was an Englishman (meaning you, kind Sir,)
to whom we were indebted for our preservation and deli-
verance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all possible
mildness; but at the same time leave them to the judg-
ment of the other two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forget-
ting their resentments, would deal impartially by them.
• "Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: "Sir,"
Said he," leave it not for us, for you may be sensible we
have reason to sentence them to the gallows: besides, Sir,
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, proposed to
us that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we
could not consent to ; but knowing their inability and your
vigilance, we did not think fit to discover it before now."
"How, Seignior,"said I," do you hear what is alledg-
H ed against you ? What can you say to j ustify so horrid an
'' action as to murder us in cold blood ?" So far, Sir, was the
wretch from denying it, that he swore d—n him but he
would do it still." But what have we done to you. Seignior
"Atkins," said I, "or what will you gain by killing us?
What shall we do to prevent you ? Must we kill you, or
you kill us r Why will you Seignior Atkins," said I, smil-
ing," put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such a fatal ne-
'« cessity ?" But to so great a rage did my scoffing and yet
severe jest put him into, that he was going to fly at me,
and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me if he had been
possessed of weapons, and had not been prevented by three
Spaniards. This unparalleled and villainous carriage,
'made us -seriously consider what was to be done. The two
Englishmen, and the Spaniard who had saved the poor
Indian's life, mightily petitioned me to hang one of them,
for an example to the rest, which should be him that had
twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, itbe-
ing at that time thought impossible that the poor slave
could recover. But they could never gain my consent to
put him to death, for the reasons above mentioned, since
it was an Englishman (even yourself) who was my deliv-
erer ; and as merciful counsels are most prevailing when
earnestly pressed, so I got them to.be of the same opinion
as to clemency. But to prevent them doing us any further
mischief, we all agreed that they should have no weapons,
as sword, gun, powder or shot, but be expelled from the
society, to live as they pleased by themselves; that neither
the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the Spaniards should
have conversation with them on any account whatsoever;
that they should be kept from coming within a certain dis-
tance from the castle, and if they dared to Coffer us any
•violence,either by spoiling, burning, killing or destroying
any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle,
belonging to the society, we would shoot them as freely
as we would -do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places we
should find them.
"This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves;
when, like a merciful judge, I called out to the two hon-
est Englishmen, saying, " you must consider they ought
not to be starved neither; and since it will be some time
before they can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us
give them some corn to last them eight months, and for
seed to sow, by which time they'll raise some for them-
selves ; let us also bestow upon them six milch goats, four
he ones and six kids, as well for their present support, as
for a further encrease; with tools necessary for their work,
as hatchets, an axe, saw, and other things convenient to
build them huts :"all which were agreed : but before they
took them into possession, I obliged them to solemn-
ly swear, never to attempt any thing against us, or their
countrymen, for the future. Thus dismissing them from
€>
our society, they went away, sullen and refractory, as the*
neither willing to go nor stay; however, seeing no reme-
dy, they took what provisions were given them, proposing
to choose a convenient place where they might live by
themselves.
"About five days after, they came to those limits ap-
pointed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by-
one of my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out an habita-
tion and plantation, the N. E. and most remote part of the
island. And there they built themselves two very hand-
some cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the
side of a mountain, with some trees already growing on
three sides of it; so that planting a few more, it would
be obscured from sight, unless particularly sought for.
When these huts were finished, we gave them some dry
goat-skins, for bedding and covering; and upon their giv-
ing us fuller assurances of their good behaviour for the fu-
'ture, we gave them some peas, barley and rice for sow-
ing, and whatever tools we could spare.
"Six months did they live in this separate condition,
in which they got their first harvest in, the quantity of
which was ixut small, because they had planted but little
land ; for indeed all their plantations being to form, made
it more difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their
clement; and when they were obliged to make their
boards and pots, &c they could make but little or nothing
of ii. But the rainy season coming on, put them into a
greater perplexity for want of a cave to keep their corn
dry, and prevent it from spoiling: and so much did this
humble them, that they begged of my Spaniards to help
them, to which the good-natured men readily consented,
and in four days' space, worked a great hole in the side of
the hill for them, large enough for their purpose, to se-
cure their corn and other things from the rain, though
not to be compared to ours, which had several additional
apartments.
"But a new whim possessed these rogues about three
quarters of ayear afterwards, which had like to have ruin-
ed us and themselves too: for it seems, being tired and
weary of this sort of living, which made them work for
themselves, without hopes of changing their condition
nothing would servethem but that they would make a voy-
age to the continent, and try if they could seize upon some
of the savages, and bring them over as slaves, to do their
drudgery, while they lived at ease and pleasure.
"Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if they
had not gone further; but they neither did nor proposed
any thing but what had mischief in the design or the event.
One morning, these three fellows came down to the li-
mited station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk
with us, which we readily granted; they told us, in short,
that being tired of their manner of living, and the labour
of their hands in such employments not being sufficient
to procure the necessaries of life, they only desired one
of the canoes we came over in, with some arms and am-
munition for their defence, and they would seek their for-
tunes abroad, and never trouble us any more. To be
sure we were glad enough to get rid of such wretched
plagues ; but yet honesty made us ingenuously represent
to them, by what we had already suffered ourselves, the
certain destruction they were running into, either of being
starved to death, or murdered by the savages. To which
they very audaciously replied, that they neither could nor
would worR; and consequently, that they might as well
be starved abroad as at home, and as to their falling into
the hands of the savages, why, if they were murdered, it
was nothing to us, there was an end of them ; neither had
they any wives or children to cry after them ; nay, so in-
tent were they upon their voyage, that if the Spaniards
had not given them arms, so they had but the canoe, they
would have gone without them. . •/
"Though we could not well spare our fire arms, rather
than they should go like naked men, we let them have
two muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which
were thought very sufficient; we gave them also goats-
flesh, a great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh,
butter, a young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to
carry twenty men. And thus, with a mast made of a long
pole, and a sail of six large goat skins dried, having a fair
breeze, and a flood tide with them, they merrily sailed
away, the Spaniards calling after them Bon -veyajo, no man
ever expecting to see them more.
"When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen
would often say to one another, " O how peaceably do we
"now live, since those turbulent fellows have left us I"
Nothing could be farther from their thouglffs than to be-
hold their faces any more; and yet scarce two and twen-

ty days had passed over their heads, but one of the %$f
glishmen, being abroad a planting, perceived at a'distance;
three men, well armed, approaching him. Away Me flies
with speed to our castle, and tells me and the rest, that
•we were all undone, for that strangers had lauded upon the
island, and who they were he could not tell'; but'added
that they were not savages, but men habited,bearing arms.
Why then, said I, we have the less occasion to be con-
cerned, since, if they v:ere not Indians, they must be
friends; for I am sure there is no good Christian upon,
earth who would not rather do us good than harm. But,
while we were considering of the event, up came the three
Englishmen, whose voices we quickly knew, and so all-
our admiration of that nature ceased at once. And our
wonder was succeeded by another sort of enquiry, which.
was, what could be the occasion of their returning so quick-
ly to the island, when we little expected, much less desir-
ed their company? But as this was better to be related by
themselves, I ordered them to be brought in, when they
gave me the following relation of their voyage.
"After two days sail, or something less, they reached
land, where they found the people coming to give them a
different sort of reception from what they expected and
desired; for, as the savages were armed with bows and
arrows, they durst not venture on shore, but steered
northward, six or seven hours, till they gained an opening,
by which they plainly perceived, thnt the land that appear-
ed from this place, was not the main land, but an island.
At their entrance iuto the opening of the sea, they discov-
ered another island on the right hand northward, and se-
veral more lying to the westward ; but being resolved to
go on shore some where or other, they put over to the-
•western Islands. Here they found the natives very cour-
teous to them, giving them several roots and dried fish;
nay, even their women were willing to supply them with
•what they could procure them to eat, bringing it a great
•way to them upon their heads. Among these hospitable
Indians they continued some days, inquiring by signs and
tokens, what nations lay around them; and were inform-
ed that there wcre several fierce and terrible people lived
every way, accustomed to eat mankind ; but for them-
selvtis they never used such diet,except those that were
taken in battley and of them they made a solemn feast.
"The Englishmen inquired how long it was since they
had -A feast of that kind? They answered, about two moons
ago, pointing to the moon ; and then two fingers; that, at
this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which
were fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishmen
were mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, which the
others mistaking, thought that they wanted some of them
for their own tood: upon which they beckoned to them,
pomting to the rising, and then to the setting of the sun;
meaning;, that by the time it appeared in the east next
morning, they would bring them some; and indeed they
were as good as their ward ; for by that time they brought
eleven men and five women, just as so many cows and
oxen are brought to a sea-port town, to victual a ship But
as brutish as these Englishmen were, their stomachs turn-
ed at the sight. What to do in this case, they could not
tell : to refuse the prisoners, would have been the highest
affront offered to the savage gentry; and to dispose of them
they knew not in what manner; however, they resolved to
accept them, and so gave them, in return, one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their
bullets; things which, tho' they were wholly ignorant of,
yet they seemed entirely contented iviih ; and dragging tne
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. But this obliged
them to put off as soon as they hud these presents,lest the
donors should have expected two or three of them to be
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next day ; and so
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though-
neither of them understood what the others said, they sail-
ed away back to the first island, and there set eight of the.
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to.
comfort, and have some conversation with, the poor cap-
tives ; but it was impossible to make them sensible of any
thing ; and nothing they could say or give^or do for them
could make them otherwise persuaded, but that they were
unbound only to be devoured : if they gave them any food,
they thought it was only to fatten them for the slaughter ;.
or looked at any one more particularly, the poor o-ca-
ture supposed itself to be the first sacrifice ; and even.
when we brought them to our island, and began to use
thei.-. with the greatest humanity and kmdness, yet they
expected every day, that their new masters would devout
them.
pa
"And thus, Sir, did these three strange wanderers con-
elude their unaccountable relation of their voyage, which
•was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, 1 asked
them, where their new family was? They told me, they
had put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg
some victuals for them. This indeed, made us all long
to see them ; and taking Friday's father with us, leaving
only two at our castle, we came down to behold these poor
creatures. -.'
"When we arrived at the hut (they being bound again
by the Englishmen, for fear of escaping) we found them
start naked, expecting their fatal tragedy; there were
three lusty men, well shaped,with straight and good limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old; and five wo-
men, two of whom might be from thirty to forty, two more
not above four and twenty; and the last, a comely tall
maiden of about seventeen Indeed all the women were
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except
that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour, and
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards
came to be clothed
"This naked appearance, together with their miserable
circumstances, was no very comfortable sight to my Span-
iards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir. without
Rattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for
they immediately ordered Friday's father to see if he knew
any of them, or if he understood what they could say.
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at
them with great seriousness; yet, as they were not of his
nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could'
understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was-
enough to answer the design, which was to assure them
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of
Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they
•Were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such-
.strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible
for me to describe But the woman, their interpreter, was
ordered next to inquire, whether they were content to be
servants, and would work for the men who had brought
them hither to save their lives! Hereupon (being at this
time unbound) they fell a capering and dancing, one tak-
ing this thing upon her shoulders, and the other that, in-
timating, that they were willing to do any thing for them*
But now, Sir, haying women among us, and dreading that
it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the
three men what they would do, and how they intended to
use these creatures, whether as servants or women ? One
of them very pertly and readily answered, they would use
them as both. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own
masters, I am not going to restrain you from that; but me-
thinks, for avoiding dissentient among you, I would only
desire you to engage,that none of you will take more than
one for a woman or wife, and that having taken this one,
none else should presume to touch her; for though we
have not a priestly authority to marry you, yet it is but rea-
sonable, that whoever thus takes a woman, should be obli-
ged to maintain her, since nobody has any thing to do with
her; and this indeed, appeared so just to all present, that
it was unanimously agreed to. The Englishmen then ask-
ed my Spaniards, whether they designed to take any of
them? but they all answered, No ; some declaring they
had already wives in Spain, and others that they cared not
to join with infidels. On the reverse, the Englishmen took
each of them atemporary wife,and so set up a new method
of living. As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the
three savage servants we had taken in the late battle, they
all lived with me in our ancient castle ; and indeed we sup-
plied the main part of the island with food, as necessity re-
quired. But the most remarkable part of the story is, how
these Englishmen, who had been so much at variance,
should agree about the choice of these women ; yet they
took away good enough to prevent quarrelling among
themselves. They set the five women in one of their
huts, and going themselves to thi- other, drew lots which
should have the first choice. Now he that had the first
lot went to the hut, and fetched out her he chose ; and it
is remarkable, that he took her that was the most home-
ly and eldest of the number, which made the rest of the
Englishmen exceedingly merry ; the Spaniards them-
selves could not but smile at it; but, as it happened, the
fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for appli-
cation and business ; and indeed she proved the best wife
of all the parcel.
"But whenthe poor creatures perceived themselves pla-
ced in a row, and separated one by one, they -were again
seized with an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they
were going to be slain in earnest; and 'when the English*
man came to take the first, the rest set up a lamentable
cry, clasped their arms around her neck, and hanging a-
bout her, took their last farewell, as they thought, in such
trembling agonies, and affectionate embraces, as would
have softened the hardest heart in the world, and make the
driest eyes melt into tears; nor could they be persuaded
but 'hat they were going to die, till such time as Friday's
father made them sensible that the Englishmen had cho«
sen them for their wives, which ended all their terror and
concern upon this occasion
"Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and
being assisted by my good natured Spaniards, in a few
hours they erected every one of them a new hut, or tent
for their separate lodging, since those they had already
were filled with tooUs, household stuff.and provision. They
all continued on the north shore of the island, but separate
as before ; the three wicked ones pitching farther off, and
the two honest men nearer our castle; so that the island
seemed to be peopled in three places, three towns begin-
ning to be built for that purpose. And here I cannot but
remark, what is very common, that the two honest men
had the worst wives (I mean as to industry, cleanlmess
and ingenuity) while the three reprobates enjoyed women
of quite contrary qualities.
"But another observation I made was, in favour of the
two honest men, to show what disparity there is between
a diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a
slothful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both
of them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and corn
to sow,sufficient for them; but both did not make the same
improvements, either in their cultivation or their plant-
ing. The two honest men had a multitude of young trees
planted about their habitations,so that when you approach-
ed near them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing
and delightful. Every thing they did prospered and flou-
rished; their grapes, planted in order, seemed as though
managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely preferable to
any of the others. Nor were they wanting to find out a
place of retreat, but dug a cave in. the most retired part of
a thick wood, to secure their wives and children with their
provision and chiefest goods, surrounded with innumera-
ble stakes, and having a most subtle entrance, in ras•.- any;
mischief should Happen, either from their fellow country-
men, or the devouringsavag.es. . »'
.
'' As to the reprobates (though I must own they were
much more civilized than before) instead of a delightful
wood surrounding their dwellings, we found the words of
King Solomon too truly verified; "I went by the vineyard-
"of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns.'*
In many places their crop was obscured by weeds; thfc
hedges having several gaps in them, the wild goats had
got irvand eaten up the corn, and here and there w,as a
dead bush to stop these gaps for the present which was no.-•

more thai) shutting the stable doorafter the steed was stol-
en away. But as to their wives, they (as observed before)
were mere difigent,and cleanly enough, especially in their
victuals, being instructed by one of the honest men, who
had been a cook's mate on board a ship : and very well it
•was so ; for as he cooked himself, his companion and their
families lived as well as the idle husbands, who did no-
thing but loiter about, fetch turtle's eggs, catch fish and
birds, and do any thing but work, and lived accordingly;
while the diligent lived very handsomely and plentifully,
in the most comfortable manner.
"And now, Sir, I come to lay'before your eyes a scene
quite different from any thing that ever happened to us
before, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time of your
residence in this island. I shall inform you of its origin
in the following manner:
"One morning Sir, very early, there came five or six
canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon their old cus-
tom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to •\o
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they not
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly
after performing their bloody execution : whoever first
discovered '.he savages, was to give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and then a proper scout
was to be placed to give intelligence of their departure.
But notwithstanding these wise measures, an unhappy dis-
aster discovered us to the savages, which was like to have
caused the desolation of the whole island ; for after the
savages were gone off in their canoes, some of my Span-
iards and I looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curio-
sity to see what they had been doing, to our great amaze-
ment beheld three savages fast asleep on the ground,
•who,either being gorged, could not awake when the others
went off, or having wandered too far into the woods, did
not come back in time. • - •
"What to do with them at first, we could not tell ; as
for slaves we had enough of them already ; and as to kill-
ing them, neither Christianity or humanity would suffer
us to shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong.
We perceived they had no boat left to ttansport them to
their own nation ; and that, by letting them wander about,
they might discover us, and inform the first savages that
should happen to land upon the same bloody occasion,
which information might entirely ruin us; and therefore
I counselled my Spaniards to secure them, and set them
about some work or other, till we could better dispose of
them.
"Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake,
took them prisoners. It is impossible to express the hor-
ror they were in, especially when bound, as thinking they
were going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon eased
them of their fear as to that point. We first took them to
the bower, where the chief of our country work lay, as
keeping goats, planting corn. Sec. and then carried them
to the two Englishmen's habitation, to help them in their
business ; but happy it was for us all we did not carry
them to our castle, as by the sequel will appear. The
Englishmen, indeed, found them work to do; but whether
they did not guard them strictly, or that they thought they
could not better themselves, I cannot tell; but certainly
one of them ran away into the woods, and they could not
hear of him for a long time after.
"Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he
got home in some of the canoes, the savages returning in
about four weeks time, and going off in the space of two
days. You may be certain, Sir this thought could not but
terrify us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that
the savage would inform his countrymen of our abode in
the island, how few and weak we were in comparison to
their numbers ; and we expected it would not be long be-
fore the Englishmen would be attacked in their habita-
tions; but the savages had not seen their places of safety
in the woods, nor our castle, which it was a great happi-
ness they did not know.
"Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc-
casion; for about eight months after this, six canoes, with
about ten men in each canoe, came sailing by the north-
side of the'island, which they were never accustomed to do
before, and landed about an hour after sunrise,near a mile
f'-om the dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seems,
had the good fortune to discover them about a league off:
so that it was an hour before they could attain the shore,
and some time longer before they could come at them.'
And now being confirmed in this opinion that they were
certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves
which were left, causing two of the three men, whom they
brought with the women, and who proved very faithful, to
lead them with their wives and other conveniences, into
their retired cave in the wood, and there to bind the two
fellows hand and foot, till they had further orders. They
then opened their fences,where theykept their milch goats
and drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to ramble
in the woods, to make the savages believe that they were
•wild ones; but the slave had given a truer information,
which madr: them come to the very enclosures. The two
frighted men sent the other slave of the three, who had
been with them by accident, to alarm the Spaniards, and
desire their assistance ; in the mean time they took their
arms and ammunition, and made to the cave where they
had sent their wives, and securing their slaves, seated
themselves in a private place, from whence they might be-
hold all the actions of the savages. Nor had they gone far,
when ascending a rising ground, they could see a little ar-
ray of Indians approach to their beautiful dwelling, and in
a few moments more, perceive the same, and their furni-
ture, to their unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming
flame; and when this was done, they spread here and
there, searching every bush and place for the people, of
whom it was very evident they had information. Upon
which the two Englishmen,not thinking themselves secure
where they stood, retreated half a mile higher in the con-
try, rightly concluding, that the farther the savages stroll-
ed, there would be less numbers together: upon which
they next took their stand by the trunk of an old tree, very
hollow and large, whence they resolved to see what would
offer; but they had not stood long there before two sava-
ges came runnmg directly towards them, us though havmg
knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved to
attack them; a little farther were three more, and five
more behind them again, all running the same way. It .
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were in
at this sight, thinking that if assistance did noi speedily
come, their cave in the wood would be,discovered,and con-
v aequently all therein lost; so they resolved to resist them
there, and when overpowered, to ascend l0 tlve top of the
trees,where they might defend themselves as long as their
ammunition lasted, and sell their lives as dear as possible
to those devouring savages. Thus fixed in their resolution,
the next considered, whether they should fire at the first
two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party,
by which the two first and the five last would be separated.
In this regulation the two savages also confirmed them, by
turning a little to another part of the wood; but the three,
qnd the five after them, came directly towards the tree.
Hereupon they resolved to take them, in a direct line, as
they approached nearer, because perhaps the first shot
might hit them all three; and upon this occasion, the man
who was to fire, charged his piece with three or four bul-
lets. And thus while they were waiting, the^avages came
on, one of them was the runaway, 'who had caused all the
mischief; so they resolved he should not escape, if they
both fired at once. But, however, though they did not
fire together, they were ready charged; when the first that
let fly was too good a marksman to miss his aim, for he
killed the foremost outright, the second (who was the run-
away Indian) fell to the ground, being shot through the
body, but not dead, and the third was a little wounded in
the shoulder,\vho sitting down on the ground,fell a scream-
. ing in a most fearful manner. The noise of the guns,
•which not only made the most resounding echoes, from
one side to the other, but raised the birds of all sorts, flut-
tering with the most confused noise, so much terrified the
five savages behind, that they stood still at first, like so ma-
ny inanimate images. But when all things were in pro-
found silence, they came to the place where their compa-
nions lay ; and here, not being sensible that they were lia-
ble to the same fate,stood over the wounded man,undoubt-
edly inquiring the occasion of this sad calamity ; and 'tis
as reasonable to suppose, he told them that it came by
thunder and lightening from the gods, havingnever seenor
,*••,' heard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives.
By this time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces,
>- fired both together a second time,when seeing them all fall
immediately on the ground, they thought they had killed
every creature of them. This made them come up boldly
before they had charged their guns, which indeed, was a
wrong step ; for when they came to the place, they found
fear alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not
at all, which obliged them to fall upon them with their
muskets; they first knocked the runaway savage on the
head, and another that was but a little wounded in the
arm, and then put the other languishing wretches out of
their pain; while he that was not hurt, with bended knees
and uplifted hands, made piteous moans, and signs to
them to spare his life; nor indeed, were they unmerciful
to the poor wretch, but pointed to him to git down at the
root of a tree hard by; and then, one of the Englishmen!
with a piece of rope twine he had in his pocket, by mere
chance, tying his two feet fast together, and his two hands
behind him, they left him there, making all the haste they
could after the other two, fearing they should find out
their cave; but tho' they could not overtake them, they
had the satisfaction to perceive them at a distance, cross a
valley towards the sea, a quite contrary way to their re-
treat ; upon which they returned to the tree, to look after
their prisoner; but when they came there, he was gone,
leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he was bound,
behind him.
"Well, now they were as much concerned as ever, as
not knowing how near their enemies might be. or in what
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to see
if all was well there, and found every thing safe, except
the women, who were frightened upon their husbands ac-
count, whom they now loved entirely. They had not been
long here, before seven of my Spaniards came to assist
them; while the other ten, their servants and Friday's fa-
ther, were gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in
case the savages should have rambled so far. There ac-
companied the seven Spaniards, one of the three savages
that had formerly been taken prisoner; and with them al-
so that very Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little be-
fore, left under the tree ; for it seems, they passed by that
way where the slaughter was made, and so carried along
with them that poor wretch that was left bound. But so
many prisoners now becoming a burthen to us, and fearing
the "dreadful consequence of their escaping, most of the
Spaniards and English urged the absolute necessity there
was of killing them for our common preservation ; but, Sir,
the authority I. bore as a governor, over-ruled that piece of
cruelty and then I ordered them to be sent prisoners to
Q
the old cave in the valley, bound hands and feet, with two
Spaniards to guard them.
"So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap-
proach of the Spaniards, and so great was their fury
against the savages for destroying their habitations, that
they had not patience to stay any longer; but taking five
Spaniards along with them, armed with four muskets, a
• pistbl, and a quarter staff, away they went in pursuit of
their enemies. As they passed by the place where the
savages were slain, it was very easy to be perceived that
more of them had been there, having attempted to carry-
off iheir dead bodies, but found it impracticable. From
a rising ground, our party had the mortification to see the
smoke that proceeded from the ruins ; when coming far-
ther in sight of the shore, they plainly perceived that the
savages had embarked in their canoes, and were putting
out to sea. This they were very sorrow for, there being no
coming at them to give them a parting salute; but how-
ever, they were glad enough to get clear of such unwel-
come guests.
"Thus the two honest, but unfortunate Englishmen,
being ruined a second time, and their improvements quite
<lestroyed,mostof my goodnatured Spaniards helped them
to rebuild, and we all assisted them with needful supplies;
nay, what is more remarkable, their three mischievous
countrymen, when they heard of it (which was after all
these disasters were over, they living more remote east-
ward) very friendly sympathised with them, and worked
for them several days ; so that, in a little time, their habi-
tations were rebuilt, their necessities supplied, and them-
selves restored to their former tranquillity.
"Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this
adventure (several canoes being driven ashore, followed
by two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly met with a
storm at sea, that very,night they departed) yet it was na-
tural to suppose, that those whose better fortune it was to
reach their native shore, would inflame their nation to an-
other ruinous attempt, with a greater force, to carry aK be-
fore them. And indeed, so it happened; for about seven
months after,our island was invaded with a most' formida-
ble navy, no lessthan eight and twenty canoes full of sav-
ages, armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows
and arrows, and such like instruments of war, landing at
the east-end of the iiland.
"You may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation our
tnen were in upon this account, and how speedy they were
to execute their resolution, having only that night's time
allowed them. They knew, that since they could not
withstand their enemies, concealment was the only way
to procure their safety ; and therefore, they took down
the huts that were built for the two Englishmen, and
drove their Hocks of goats, together with their own at the
bower, to the old cave in the valley, leaving as little ap-
pearance of inhabitants as possible ; and then posted them-
selves, with all their force,at the plantation of the two men.
As they expected, so it happened; for early next morn-
ing, the Indians, leaving their canoes at the cast-end of the
island, came running along the shore, about two hundred
and fifty in number, as near as could be guessed. O«r ar-
my was but little indeed: and what was our greatest mis-
fortune, we had not arms sufficient for them. The account,
as to the men, Sir, is as follows; viz. 17 Spaniards, 5 En-
glishmen, Old Friday, the three savages, taken with the
five women, who proved faithful servants, and three other
slaves, living with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had
11 muskets, 5 pistols, 3 fowling pieces, 2 swords, 3 old
halberts, 5 muskets or fowling pieces, taken from the sai-
lors whom you reduced. As to the slaves, we gave three
of them halberts, and the other three long staves, with-
greatiron spikes at the headof them, with hatchets by their
sides, we also hut! hatchets sticking in our girdles, besides
the fire-arms ; nay, two of the women, inspired with Ama-
zonian fortitude, could not be dissuaded from fighting
along with their dear husbands, and if they died, to die with
them. Seeing their resolution, we gave them hatchets
likewise ; but what pleased them best, were the bows
and arrows Cwhich they dextrously knew how to use)that
the Indians had left behind them, after their memorable
battle one against another.
"Over this army, which though little, was of great in-
trepidity, I was constituted chief general and commander,
and knowing Will Atkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet
a man of invincible courage, 1 gavehim the power of com- .
manding under me; he had six men with their muskets
loaded with six or seven bullets a piece, and were planted
just behind a small thicket of bushes,as an advanced guard,
having orders to let the first pass by ; and then whenhefir-
ed into the middle of them, making a nimble retreat round
.a part of the wood, and so corns in the rear of the Span-
iards, who were shaded by a thicket of trees: for though
the savages came on with the fierceness oflions, yet they
wanted the subtility of foxes, being out of all manner of
order, and straggling in heaps every way; and indeed,
when Will Atkins, after fifty of the savages had passed by,
had ordered three of his men to give fire, so great was
their consternation, to see so many men killed and wound-
ed, and hear such a dreadful noise, and yet know not from
whence it came, that they were frightened to the highest
degree; and when the second volley was given, they coil-
eluded no less but that their companions were slain by
thunder and lightening from Heaven. In this notion they
would have continued, had Will Atkins and his men retir-
ed.as soon as they fired, according to order ; or had the
rest been near them, to pour in their shot cont;nually,there
might have been a complete victory obtained ; but staying
to load their pieces again, discovered the whole matter.
They were perceived by some of the scattering savages at
a distance, who let fly their arrows among them, wounded
Atkins, and killed his fellow Englishman, and one of the
Indians taken with a women. Our party did not fail to
answer them, and in their retreat killed about twenty sav-
ages. Here I cannot but take notice of our poor dying
slave, whotho'stopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet
with his staff and hatchet, desperately and gallantly assail-
ed his pursuers, and killed five of the savages, before his
life submitted to multiplicity of wounds Nor isthe cruelty
or malice of the Indians to be less remarked, in breaking
the arms, legs and heads of the two dead bodies, with their
clubs and wooden swords, after a most wretched manner.
As Atkins retreated, our party advanced to interpose be-
tween him and the savages; but after three vollies, we
were obliged to retreat also ; for they were so numerous
and desperate, that they came up to our very teeth, shot
their arrows like a cloud, and their wounded men enraged
with cruel pain, fought like madmen. They did not how-
ever, think fit to follow us, but drawing themselves up in
a circle, they gave two triumphant shouts in token of vic-
tory, though they had the grief to see several of their
wounded men bleed to death before them.
"After 1 had, Sir. drawn up our little army together,
upon a rismg ground, Atkins, wounded as he was. would
have had us attack the whole body of the savages at once.
I was extremely well pleased, with the gallantry of the
mat: : but, upon consideration, I replied," You perceive,
"Seignior Atkins, how their wounded men fight; lei them.
"alone till morning,when they, will be faint, slifFand sore,
<' and then we shall have fewer to combat with." To
which Atkins, smiling replied, " That's very true, Seigi
'' nior, so shall 1 too; and that's the reason I would fight
"them now I am warm." We all answered, Seignior
Atkins, for your part, you have behaved very gallantly;
and, if you are not able to approach the enemy in the
mornmg, we will fight for you, till then we think it con-
venient to wait, and so we tarried.
"By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve
to fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one
volley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to
do, by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, be-
tween the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning
short south,came privately to a place where the thickest of
them were. Unheard and unperceived, eig»ht of us fired
among them, and did dreadful execution ; and in half a
minute after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wound-
ing abundance of them, and then dividing ourselves into
three bodies, eight persons in each body, we marched
from among the trees, to the very teeth of the enemy,
sending forth the greatest shouts and acclamations. The
savages hearing a different noise from three quarters at
once, stood in the utmost confusion ; but coming in sight
of us, let fly a volley of arrows, which wounded poor old
Friday, yet happily it did not prove mortal. We did not,
however, give them a second opportunity ; but rushing in
among them, we fired three several ways, and then, fell td
work with our swords, staves, hatchets, and the butt-end
of our muskets, with a fury not to be resisted; so that, with
the most dismal screaming and howling they had recourse
to their feet, to save their lives by a speedy flight. Nor
must we forget the valour of the two women; for they
exposed themselves to the greatest dangers, killed many
with their arrows, and valiantly destroyed several more
with their hatchets-
"In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired,
that wt did not then trouble ourselves to purv e them to
their canoes, ia which we thought they would presently

."v ,
put to the ocean ; but there happening dreadful storm at
sea, which continuing all that night, it not only prevented
their voyage, but dashed several of their boats to pieces
against the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the
shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off. After
our men had taken some refreshment and a little reposei
they resolved early in the morning to go towards the place
of their landing, and see whether they were gone off, or in
what posture they remained. This necessarily led them
to the place of battle, where several of the savages were
expiring, a sight no way pleasing to generous minds, to
delight in misery, though obliged to conquer them by the
law of arms; but our own Indian slaves put them out of
their pain, by dispatching them with their hatchets. At
length, coming in view of the remainder of the army, we
found them leaning upon their knees, which were bended
towards their mouth, and the head between the two hands.
Hereupon, coming within musket-shot of them, I ordered
two pieces to be fired without ball, in order to alarm them,
that we might plainly know, whether they had the courage
to venture another battle, or were utterly dispirited from
such an attempt, that so we might accordingly manage
them And, indeed, the project took very well ; for, no
sooner did the savages hear the first gun, and perceive the
flash of the second, but they suddenly started upon their
feet, in the greatest consternation : and when we approach-
ed towards them, they ran howling and screaming away
up the hill into the country.
"We could rather, at first, have wished, that the wea-
ther had permitted them to have gone off to the sea; but
•when we considered, that their escape might occasion the
approach of multitudes, to our utter ruin and dcsolution,
we were very well pleased the contrary happened: and
. Will Atkins (who, though wounded, would not part from
us all this while'', advised us not to let slip this advantage,
but clapping between them and their boats, deprive them
of the capacity of ever returning to plague the island:
"1 know," said he, " there is but one objection you can
"make, which is, that these creatures living like beasts
"in the wood, may make excursions, rifle the plantations,
"and destroy the tame goats ; but then, consider, we had
"better to do with aa hundred men, whom we can kill,
"or make slaves of a leisure, than with an hundred na-
a Uons, whom it is impossible w« should save ourselves
u from, much less subdue." This advice, and these ar-
guments beingapproved of, we set fire to their boats ; and
though they were so wet that we could not burn them en-
tirely, yet we made them incapable of swimming in the
seas, As soon as the Indians, perceived what we were do-
ing, many of them run out of the woods, in sight of us,
and kneeling down, piteously cried out, Oa, Oa, Warama-
koa. Intimating, I suppose, that if we would but spare
their canoes, they never would trouble us again.
"But all their complaints, submissions, and entreaties,
were in vain; for self perscrvation obliging us to the con-
trary, we destroyed every one of them that had escaped
the fury of the ocean. When the Indians perceived this,
they raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods,
where they continued ranging about, making the woods
ring with their lamentation. Here we should have con-
sidered that making these creatrues thus desperate, we
ought, at the same time to have set a sufficient guard upon
the plantations: for the savages, in their ranging about
found out the bower, destroyed the tences, trod the corn
down under their feet and tore up the vines and grapes.
It is true we were always able to fight these creatures;
but, as they were too swift for us, and very numerous, we
durst not go out single, for fear of them, though that too
was needless, they having no weapons, nor any materials
to make them; and indeed, their extremity appeared in
a little time after.
"Though the savages, as already mentioned, had des-
troyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes. &c. yet we
had still left our stock of cattle in the valley, by the cave
•with some little corn that grew there, and the plantation
of Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being
killed by an arrow, they were now reduced to two: it is re-
markable that this was the fellow who cut the poor Indian
•with his hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my
countrymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so low
•we came to the resolution to drive the savages up to the
farther part of the island where no Indians landed; to kill
as many of them as we could; till we had reduced their
number; and then to give the remainder some corn to
plant, and to teach them how to live by their daily labour.
Accordingly we pursued,them with our guns, atihe hear-
ing of which they were so terrified, that they would fall to
the ground. Every day we killed and wounded some of
them, and many were found starved to death, so that our
hearts began to relent at the sight of such miserable ob-
jects At last, with great difficulty, taking one of them
alive, and using him with kindness, and tenderness, we
brought him to Old Friday, who talked to him, and told
him, how good we would be to them all, giving them corn
and land to plant and live in, and present nourishment,
provided they should keep within such bounds as should
be allotted them, and not do prejudice to others: "Go
"then " said he, " and, inform your countrymen of this:
"which, if they will not agree to, every one of them shall
'•£ be slain."
"*' "The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being re-
duced to about thirty-seven,joyfully accepted the offer, and
earnestly begged for food : hereupon we sent twelve Span-
iards and two Englishmen, well armed, together with Old
Friday, and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large
quantity of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats';
and the poor Indiuns being ordered to sit down on the side
of the hill tht:y ate the victuals very thankfully, and have
proved faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their
bounds, where at this day, they quietly and happily re-
main, and where we now and then visit them. They are
confined to a neck of land about a mile and a half broad)
and three or four in length, on the south east corner of the
island, the sea being before, and lofty mountains, behmd
them, free from the appearance of canoes; and indeed
their countrymen never made any enquiry alter them.
We gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives;
have taught themto build huts, make wooden spades, plant
corn, make bread, breed tame goats and milch then;, as
likewise to make wicker-work,in which 1 must ingenous-
ly confess, they infinitely outdo us, having made them-
selves several pretty necessaries and fancies, as baskets,
sieves, bird-cages, and rupboards, as also stools, beds,and
couches, nojless useful than delightful; and now they live
the most innocent and inoffensive creatures that ever were
subdued in the world, wanting nothing but wives to make
them a nation
"Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to my.
ability, an impartial account of the various transactions
that have happened in the island since your departure, to
this day: and we have great reason to acknowledge the
kind providence of Heaven in our merciful deliyertnce*
When you inspect your little kingdom, you will find in it
some little improvement,your flocks increased, and your
subjects augmented, so that from a desolate island, as this
was before your wonderful deliverance on it, here is a vi-
sible prospect of its becoming a populous and well go-
'^verned kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory."
There is no doubt to suppose but that the preceding re-
lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no
less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who
heard it : nor where these people less pleased with those
necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the
knives, scissars, spades.shovels and pick-axes,with which
they now adorn their habitations.
So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work,
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted
them, that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, ihey
seemed at a distance as though they had lived like bees in
a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very in-
dustrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of bas-
ket work round the outside ; the walls were worked in as a
basket, in pannelsor strong squares of thirty two in num.-
der standing about seven feet high; in the middle was an-
other, not above twenty-two paces round, but much strong-
er built, being of an octagonal form and in the eight cor-
ners stood eight strong posts, round the top of which he
laid strong pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which
he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, J assure
you, and joined very well together, with iron spikes which.
he made himself; for he hud made himself a forge, with
a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work, form-
ing an anvil out of one of the iron crowns to work upon,
and in this manner would he mako himself hooks, ataples,
spikes, bolls, and hinges. After he hud pitched thereof .
of his innf rmost tent he made it so firm between the raft-
ers with basket work, thatching that over again with rice-
straw, and over that a laige leaf ot a tree, that his house
was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. The outer cir-
cuit v/as covered as aleun to, quite round this mner apart-
ment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles to the
top posts of the inner house, about twenty feet distant, so
that there was a space like a wall between the outer and in-
ner wall, near twenty feet in breadth The mner place he
partitioned off with the same wicker work, dividing it into
six neat apartments, every one of which had a door, first
into the entry of the main tent, and another into the space
and walk that was round it, not only convenient for retreat,
but for family necessaries. Within the door of the outer
circle, there was a passage directly to the door of the in-
ner house ; on either side was a wicker partition, and a
door, by which you go into a room twenty-two feet wide*'
and about thirty long; and through that ir.to another of a
smaller length; so that in the outer circle were ten hand-
spit.e rooms, six of which were only to be come at thro'
the apartments of the inner tent, serving as retiring rooms
to the respective chambers of the inner circle, and four
large warehouses, which went in through one another,
two on either hand of the passage that led thro' the outer
door to the inner tent. In short, nothing could be built
more ingeniously, kept more neat, or have better conve-
niences; and here lived the three families, Will Atkins,
his companion, their wives and children^ and the widow
of the deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught
their wives the knowledge of any thing more than the
sailor's custom of swearing by the name of God. The
greatest improvement their wives had, was, they taught
them to speak English so as to be understood.
None of their children were then above six years old;
they were all fruitful enough ; and I think the cook's
mate's wife was big of her sixth child.
When I enquired of the Spaniards about their circum-
stances, whUe among the savages, they told me, that they
abandoned themselves to despair, reckoning themselves a
poor and miserable people, that had no means put into
their hands, and consequently must soon be starved to
'death. They owned however, that they were in the
wrong to think so, and for refusing the assistance that rea-
son offered for their support, as well as future deliver-
ance, confessing that grief was a most insignificant pas-
sion, as iu looked upon things as without remedy, and hav-
ing no hope of things to come; all which verified this
noted proverb,
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
Nor did his remarks end here; for making observa-
tions unto my improveiiient,andupon my condition at first,
infinitely worse than theirs, he told me, that Englishmen
hftd, in their distress, greater presence of mind than those
ofany other country that hs had met with ; and that they
and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle under misfortunes. When they landed among
the savages, they found but little provision except they
•would turn cannibals, there being but a few roots, and
herbs, with little substance in them, and of which the na-
tives gave them but very sparingly. Many were the ways
they took to civilize and teach the savages, but in vain;
for they would not own them to be their instruciors,
•whose lives were owing to their bounty. Their extremi-
ties were very great, and many days being entirely with-
out food, the savages there being more indolent and less
devouring than those who had better supplies. When they
•went out to battle they were obliged to assist these people
in one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had like
to have been devoured. They had lost their ammunition,
•which rendered their fire-arms useless; nor could they use
the. bows and arrows that were given them so that while
the armies were at a distance, they had no chance, but
•when close, then they could be of service with halberts
and sharpened slicks put into the muzzels of their mus-
kets. They made themselves targets of wood, covered
\vith the skins of wild beasts; and when one happened to
be knockeddown, the rest of the company fought over him
till he recovered; and then standing close in a line, they
\vouldmake their way through a thousand savages. At the
return of their friend, who they thought had been entomb-'
•ed in the bowls of their enemies, their joy was inconceiv-
able. Nor were they less surprised at the sight of the
loaves of bread I had sent them, things that they had not
seen for several years, at the same time crossing and bless-
ing it as though it was manna sent from Heaveu; but
when they knew the errand, and perceived the boat which
was to carry them to the person and place from whence
such relief came, this struck them with such a surprise of
joy as made some of them faint away, and others burst out
into tears.
This was the summary account that I had from them.
I shall now inform the reader what I next did forthem,and
in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion
that the savages would scarce trouble them any more, so
we had no apprehension on that score- I told them I was
come purely to establish, and not to remove them ; and
upon that occasion, had not only brought them necessa-
ries for convenience and defence, but also artificers, and
other persons, both for their necessary employments, and
to add to their number. They were altogether when I
thus talked to them; and before I delivered to them the
stores 1 brought I asked them one by one, if they had en-
tirely forgot their first animosities, would engage in the
strictest friendship, and shake hands with one another?
On this Will Atkins, with abundance of good humour said
they had afflictions enough to make them all sober, and
enemies enough to make them all friends : as for himself,
he would live and die among them owning that what the
Spaniards had done to him, hisown mad humour had made
necessary for them to do. Nor had the Spaniards occa-
sion to justify their proceedings tome ; but they told me,
that since Will Atkins had behaved himself so valiantly in
fight, and at other times showed such a regard to the com-
mon interest of them all, they had not only forgotten all
that was past, but thought he ought as much to be trusted
with arms and necessaries as any of them, which they tes-
tified by making him next in command to the governor:
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving
me this solemn assurance, that they would never separate
their interest again as long as they lived.
After these kind declarations of friendship, we appoint-
ed all of us to dine together the next day ; upon this I
caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore for
that purpose, to assist in dressing our dinner. Webrought
from the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together
with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it ; and in par-
ticular I gave them ten bottles ot French claret, and ten
of English beer, which was very acceptable to them. The
Spaniards added to our feast, five whole kids, which being
roasted, three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sai-
lors, on board, and the other two we ate ourselves After
our merry and innocent feast was over,I began to distribute
my cargo among them. First 1 gave them linen sufficient
to make every one of them four shirts,and at the Spaniard's
request made them up six. The thin English stuff, 1 al-
lotted to make every one a light coat like a frock, agreea-
ble to the climate, andleft them such a quantity as to make
more upon their decay ; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and
stockings. It is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfac-
tion which sat upon the countenances of these poor men,
•when they perceived what care I took of them, as ifl had
%
been a common father to them all; and they all engaged
never to leave the island, till I gave my consent for their
departure. I then presented to them the people I brought,
viz. the taylor, smith, and two carpenters; but my Jack-
of-all-trades was the most acceptable present I could make
them. My taylor fell immediately to work, and made ev-
ery one of them a shirt; after which, he learned the wo-
men how to sew and stitch, thereby to become the more
helpful to their husbands. Neither were the carpentejs
less useful, taking in pieces their clumsy things; instead
of which they made convenient and handsome tables,
stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers and shelves. But
•when I carried them to see Will Atkins' basket-house.they
owned they never saw such a piece of natural ingemiity be-
fore; *' I am sure," said one of the carpenters," the man
"that built this has no need of us ; you need, Sir, da no-
"thing but give him tools."
I divided the tools among them in this manner: to eve-
ry man I gave a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as
having no harrows or plows; and to every separate place
a pick-axe,a crow, a broad axe, and a saw, with a store for a
general supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left
them also nails, staples, hinges,hammers, chissels, knives,
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron work; and for the
•use of the smith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron,
for a supply; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored
them even to profusion; or at least, to equip a sufficient
little army against all opposers whatsoever.
The young man (whose mother was unfortunatelystarv-
ed to death) together with the maid, a pious and well edu-
cated young woman, seeing things so well ordered on skore
(for I made them accompany me) and considering they
had no occasion to go so far a voyage as the East Indies,
they both desired of me, that I would leave them there and
enter them among*my subjects. This I readily agreed to,
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three little
houses erected, environed with basket-work, pallisadoed
like Atkins', and adjoining to his plantation. So contriv-
ed were their tents, that each of them had a room apart to
lodge in, while the middle tent was not only their store-
house, but their place for eating and drinking At this
time the twoEnglishmen removed theirhabitations to their
former place; so that now the island was divided into
three colonies; first, those I have just now mentioned?
» T»
K .'
* •
secondly, that of Will Atkins, where there were four fam-
ilies of Englishmen, with their wives and children, the
•widow and her children, the young man and the maid,
who by the way, we made a wife of before our departure;
three savages who were slaves; the taylor, smith (who
served also as a gun-smith) and my other celebrated per-
son called Jack-of-all-trades. Thirdly, my chief colony,
which consisted of the Spaniards, with old Friday,who still
remained at my old habitation, which was my capital city;
and surely never was there such a metropolis, it now being
hid in so obscure a grove, that a thousand men might have
ranged the island a month, and looked purposely for it,
without being able to find it, though the Spaniards had en-
larged its boundaries, both without and within, in a most
surprising manner-
But now I think it high time to speak of the young
French priest of the order of St;Benedict,whose judicious
and pious discourses, upon sundry occasions, merit an ex-
traordinary observation ; nor can his being a French Pa-
pist priest. I presume, give offence to any of my readers,
•when they have this assurance from me, that he was a per-
son of the most courteous disposition, extensive charity,
and exalted piety. His arguments were always agreeable
to reason, and his conversation the most acceptable of any -
person that I ever yet met with in my life.
"Sir," said he to me, one day, " since under God," at
the same time crossing his breast, " you have not only
"saved my life; but by permitting me to go this voyage,
"have granted me the happiness of. free conversation, I
"think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, to save
"what souls 1 can, by bringing them to the knowledge of
"some catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation ; and since
"these people arc under your immediate government, in
"gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you have done
"for me, I shall offer no farther points in religion, than
*' what shall merit your approbation." Being pleased with
the modesty of his carriage, I told him he should not be
worse used for being ot a different persuasion, if upon that
very account, we did not differ in points of faub,not decent
in a part of the country where ihe poor Indians ought to
be instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and his
Son Jesus Christ. To this ha replied, that conversation
Kiigtn easily be separated from disputes; that we would
Discourse with me rather as a gentleman than a religious:
out that, if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon
jny desiring the same, I would give him liberty to defend
his own principles. He further added, that he would do all
that became him in his office, as a priest as well as a Chris-
tian, to procure the happiness of all that were in the ship:
that though he could not pray with, he would pray for us,
on all occasions ; and then he told me several extraordinary
events of his life, within a few years past; but particularly
the last which was the most remarkable ; that in this voy-
age, he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and un-
shipped : his first design was to have gone to Martinico;
for which, taking ship at St. Malos, he was forced into
Lisbon by bad weather, the vessel running a-ground in the
mouth of the Tagus; that from thence he went on board
a Portuguese ship, bound to the Madeiras, whose master
being but an indifferent mariner, and out of his reckoning,
they were drove to Fial, where selling their commodity,
which was corn, they resolved to take in their loading at
the Isle of May, and to sail to Newfoundland ; at the banks
of which meeting with a French, ship bound to Quebec,
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, in
this ship he embarked ; the master of which dying at Que-
bec, that voyage was suspended ; and lastly, shipping him-
self for France, this last ship was destroyed by fire, as be-
fore has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another morn-
ing he comes to me, just »s I was going to visit the F.n-
glishmen's colony, and tells me, that as he knew the pros-
perity of the island was my princip.al desire, he had some-
thing to communicate agreeable to my design, by which
perhaps he might put it more than he yet thought it was,
in the way of the benediction of Heaven, "How, Sir?"
said I in a surprise, " are we not yet in the way of God's
"blessings, after all these signal providences and deliver-
"ances, of which you have had such an ample relation I"
He replied, " I hope, Sir, you are in the way, and that
"your good design will prosper : but still there are some
"among you that are not equally right in their actions;
"and remember, I beseech you, Sir, that Achan, by his
." crime, removed God's blessing from the camp of the
"children of Israel; that though sixand thirty were entirc-
"ly innocent, yet they became the objects of divine ven-
"geance, and bore the weight of his punishment accord-
"ingly."
So sensibly was I touched with this discourse, and so sa-
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his soul, that I
desrred him to accompany me to the Englishmen's plan-
tations, which he was very glad of, by reason they were
the subject of what he designed to discourse with me
about: and while we walked on together, he began in the
following manner:
"Sir, said he, I must confess it is a great unhappiness
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion;
but surely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God,
•who having given us some stated rules for our service and
obedience,we ought not, willingly and knowingly to offend
him either by neglecting what he has commanded, or by
. doing what he was forbidden. This truth every Christian
owns,that when any one presumptuously sins againstGod's
command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from
him ; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent .
such neglect of, or sin against God and his commands." I
thanked the young priest for expressing so great &^ con-
•ern for us, and desired him to explain the particulars of
what he had observed, that according Jo the parable of
Achan, I " might remove the accursed thing from among
"us." Why then, Sir, said he, in the first place, you have
i'jur Englishmen, who have savage women to their wives,
by whom they have several children, though none of them
are legally married, as the law of God and man requires;
they, I say, Sir, are no less than adulterers, and as they
still live in adultery, are liable to the curse of God. I know,
Sir, you may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of
any kind ; as also, pen, ink, and paper, to write down a con-
tract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But
neither this nor what the Spanish governor has told you,
of their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage,
nor any more th5n an agreement to keep them from quar-
relling among themselves; for, Sir, the essence or sacra-
ment of matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in
mutual consent, but in the legal obligation, which compels
them to own end acknowledge one another, to abstain from
other persons, the men provide for their wives and chil-
dren, and the women to the same and like conditions, mu-
tatis mutandis, on their side : whereas, Sir, these men, up- ,
on their own pleasure, on any gccasion, may forsake those
women,and marry others, and by disowning their children,
suffer them utterly to perish. "Now,' Sir," added he,
"can God be honored in such an unlawful liberty as this?
"how can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours,if men
are allowed to live in so licentious a way ?" I was indeed
struck with the thing myself, and thought that they were
much to blame, that no formal contract had been made
though it had been but breaking a stick between them
to engage them to live as man and wife, never to separate,
but love, cherish, and comfort one another all their lives •
"yet,Sir,"said I," when they took these women, I was
not here, and if it is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I
cannot help it." "True, Sir," answered the young priest,
"you cannot be charged with tjiat part of the crime which
was done in your absence: but I beseech you, don't flatter
yourself, that you are under no obligation now to put a
period to it; which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be
entirely on you alone, since it is ceitainly in nobody's pow-
er but yours, to alter their condition." I must confess, I
was so dull, that I thought he meant I should part them
and knowing that this would put the whole island in con-
fusion, I told him I could not consent to it upon any ac-
count whatsoever, "Sir,"said he in a great surprise," I
do not mean that you should separate, but murry them! by
a written contract, signed by both man and woman, and by
all the witnesses present, which all the European laws de-
cree to be of sufficient efficacy." Amazed with such vali-
dity of a written contract, I acknowledged all that he said
to be very just and kind, and that I would discourse with
the men about it ; neither could I see what reason could
they have not to let him marry them, whose authority in
that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they weremarri-
ed by any of our clergymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was this, that
though these English subjects of mine have lived with
these women seven years, and though they were of good
understanding, and capable of instruction, having learned
not only to speak, but to read English, yet all this while
they had never taught them any thing of the Christian
religion, or the knowledge of God, much less in wt,at
manner he ought to be served. "And is not this an un-
|'accountable neglect J"said he warmly. -'Depend upon
it, God Almighty will call them to account for such con-
tempt And though I am not of your religion, yet I
should be glad to see these people released from the devil's
power, and be saved by the principles of the Christian re-
ligion, the knowledge of God, of a redeemer, the resur-
rection, and of a iuture state. But-as it is not too late if.
..... - , R2
you please to give me leave to instruct them, I doubt not
but 1 shall supply this great defect, by bringing them into
the great circle of Christianity, even while you continue
in the island"
I could hold no longer,but embracing him, told him with
a thousand thanks, I would grant whatever he requested,
and desired him to proceed in the third article, which he
did in the following manner:
"Sir," said he, "it should be a maxim among all
Christians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propa-
gated by all possible means, and on all occasions. Upon
this account our church sends missionaries into Persia,
India, and China, men who are willing to die for the sake
of God and the Christian faith, in order to bring poor in-
fidels into the way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is
an opportunity to convert seven and thirty poor savages, I
wonder how you can pass by such an occasion of doing
goad, which is really worth the expence of a man's whole
life."
I must confess I was so confounded at this discourse,
that I could not tell how to answer him. "Sir,"said he,
seeing me in disorder, " I shall he very sorry if I have
"givt.-n you offence." " No, Sir,"said I "I am rather con-
founded ; and you know my circumstances, that being
bound to the East Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot
•wrong the owners so much, as to detain the ship here, the
men lying at victuals and wages on their account. If I stay
above twelve duys, I must pay 3i. sterling fier rfzVra.demur-
rage, nor must the ship stop above eight days more ; so
that 1 am unable to engage in this work, unless I would
leave the ship, and be reduced to my former condition."
The priest, though he owned this was hard upon me, yet
laid it to my conscience, whether the blessings of saving se-
ven and thirty souls was not worth venturing all that 1 had
in the world ?" Sir,"said I," it is very true ; but as you are
an ecclesiastic, it naturally falls into your profession ; why,
therefore, don't you rather offer to undertake it yourself,
than press me to it ?" upon this he turned about, making
a very low bow," I most humbly thank God and-you, Sir,
(said he) for so blessed a call; and most willingly under-
take so glorious an office, which will sufficiently conipen-
stite all the hazards and difficulties I have gone through
in a long and uncomfortable voyage."
. While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture
m his face, by his colour going and coming ; at the same
time his eyes sparkled like fire, and all the signs of- the
most zealous transports. And when 1 asked whether he
was in earnest ?" Sir," said he,''itwas to prench to the
Indians I consented to come along with you ; thtse infidels
even in this little island, are infinitely of more worth than.
my poor life: if so that I should prove the happy instru-
ment of saving these poor creatures' souls, I care not if I
neversee my native country again. One thing' I only beg
of you more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to
be my interpreter, without "hose assistance neither of us
will understand each other."
This request very sensibly troubled me ; first, upon Fri-
day's being bred a Protestant; and secondly, for the af-
fection I bore to him for his fidelity: But, immediately
the remembrance of Friday's father coming into my head,
I recommended him to him as having learned Spanish,
which the priest also understood ; and so was thoroughly
satisfied with him.
When we came to the Englishmen, after I had toldthem
what necessary things I had done for them, I talked tothem
of the scandalous life they led, told them what notice the
clergyman had taken of it, and asked them if they were
married men or bachelors? They answered, two of them
were widowers, and the other three single men. But, said
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? They all said, that they took them before the
governor as such, having nobody else to marry them,
which they thought as legal, as if they had had a parson.
No doubt, said I, but in the eyes of God it is so : but unless
I am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these
poor creatures, I can do nothing more for you, neither can
you expect God's blessing while you live in such an open
course of adultery. Hereupon, Will Atkins, who spoke
for the rest, told me, That they believed their wives the
most innocent and virtuous creatures in the world; that
they would never forsake them while they had breath ;and
that, if there was a clergyman in the ship, they would be
married to them with all their hearts. I told you before,
said I, that I have a minister with me, who shall marry
you to-morrow morning, if you are willing; so I would
have you consult to-night with the rest about it I told him
the degyman was a Frenchman, and knew not a word of
- English, but that I would act as aclerkbetween them. And
indeed this business met with such speedy success, thai
they all told me, in a few minutes after, that they were
ready to be formally married, as soon as I pleased; with
which informing the priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now regamed, but that the women should be
made sensible of the meanipg of the thing ; with which be-
ing well satisfied, they with their husbands attended at my
apartment the next morning ; there was my priest, habited
in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round
it, much resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he
made of marrying the women, who were not baplized.gave
them an exceeding reverence for his person : nor indeed
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told
them, That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the
ser.se of the laws of the socicty,they had lived in open adul-
tery,, which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or
final separation, could put an end to; and even here was a
difficulty with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony,
in marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater,
unbaptised ; but yet there was time enough to make them
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could
be done; that, besides, he believed themselves very indif-
ferent Christians ; and consequently had not discoursed
with their wives upon that subject; and that unless they
promised him to do so, he could not marry them, as being
expressly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily.
"Bin Lord, Sir," said Will Atkins, to me, "how
should we teach them religion, who know nothing of it
ourselves? How can we talk to our wives of God, Jesus
Christ, heaven and hell ? \vhy they would only laugh at us,
Who never yet have practised religion, but on the contrary
all manner of wickedness." " VViJl Atkins," said I, " can-
not you tell your wife she is in the wrong,and that her gods
. are idols, which can neither speak nor understand; but that
our God, who has made, can destroy all things; that he.
rfewards the good and punishes the wicked ; and at last will
bring us to judgment; cannot you tell her these things?"
"That's true,"said At,kins, "but then she'll tell me it is
utterly fulse, since 1 am not punished and sent to the de-
vil, who hath been such a wicked creature." These words.
Interpreted to the priest. ".Q !" said fie," tell him his

t
repentance will make him a very good minister to his
spouse, and qualify him to preach on the mercy and long
suffering of a merciful being, who desires not the death of
a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last judgment;
this will lead him to the doctrine of the resurrection, and
will makchim an excellent preacher to his wife." I re-
peated this to Atkins, who being mono than ordinarily af-
fected with it replied) " I know all this, Sir, and a great
deal more; but how can I have the impudence to talk
thus to my wife, when my consience witnesses against
me ?" " Alas !" said he (with tears in his eyes, and giving
a great sigh) " as for repenting, that is forever past me."
"Past you ! Atkins," said I, " what do you mean ?" " You
"know well enough," said he," what I mean; I mean it is
'' too late."
When I told the priest what he said, the poor affection-
ate man could not refrain from weeping; but recovering
himself," pray, Sit," said he, " ask him if he is contented
that it is too late ; or is he concerned, and wishes it were
not so !" This question I put fairly to Atkins, who repli-
ed in a passion," How can I be easy in a state which I
"know must terminate in my ruin! for I really believe
"some time or other I shall cut my throat, to put a period
"both to my life, and to the terrors of my conscience."
At this, the clergyman shook his head, " Sir, " said he,
"pray tell him it is not too late ; Christ will give him,re-
pentence, if he has recourse to the merits of his passion.
Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy?
There may indeed be a time when provoked mercy wil
no longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in
this world." I told Atkins every word the priest had said,
who then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we
discoursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in
religious matter : yet all of them promised to do their en-
deavours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon
which promises, the pHest married the three couple. But,
as Atkins was the only sincere convert,and of more sense
than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly enquiring af-
ter him :'' Sir," said he, " let us walk out of this labyrinth
and I dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to
his wife already." And indeed we found it true, for com-
ing to the edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and his
savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush, in very ear-
nest discourse ; -he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of
the earth,lo himself, to her, the woods and the trees. Im-
mediately we could perceive him start upon his feet, fall
down upon hisknees, and lift up both his hanfjs ; at which
the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our
great misfortune was, we coukl not hear one word that
passed between them. Another time he would embrace
her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kissing her with the
greatest transports., and then both kneel down for some
minutes together. Such raptures of joy did this occasion
in my young priest, that he could scarcely contain him-
self : and a little after this, we observed by her motion, as
frequently lifting up her hands, and laying them on her
breast, that she was mightily affected with his discourse
and so they withdrew from our sight- .
When we came back, we found them both waiting Ho
be called in; upon which he agreed to examine him alone
and so I began to discourse him thus. "Prithee, Will
"Atkins," said I, " what education have you? What was
"your father?" „
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be; be was,
Sir, a clergyman, who gave me good instruction, or cor-
rection, which I despised, like a brute as I was, and, mur-
dered my poor father.
Pr. Ha ! a murderer.
(Here the Priest started, and looked fiale, thinking he
had really killed his father.)
R, C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke his heart
by the most unnatural turri.of disobedience to the tcnder-
est and best of fathers-
R C. Well, I pray God grant, you repentence: I did
not ask you to extort a confession; but I asked you be-
cause I see you have more knowledge of what is good
than your companions.
W. A. O Sir, whenever I look back upon my past life,
conscience upbraids me with my father; the sins against
our parents, make the deepest wounds, and their weight
lies the heaviest upon the mind.
R. C. You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly for me;
I am not able to bear it.
•W? A. You bear it Sir ! you know nothing of it.
R. C. But yes. Atkins, I do ; and every shore, valley,
and tree-in this island witness the anguish of my soul for
n>y undutifulness to my kindfather, whom I have murder-
ed likewise; yet my repentance falls infmitely short of
your's. But Will, how comes the sense of this matter to
touch you jusr now?
W. A. Sir, the work you have set me about, has occa-
sioned it; for talking to my wife about God and religion,
she has preached me such a sermon, that I shall retain it
in lasting remembrance.
R. C. No, no, it is your own pious arguments to her,
lias made conscience fling them back upon you. But pray
Atkins, inform us what passed between you and your
wife, and how did you begin?
W. A. I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the rea-
son of such compacts , whereby order and justice is main-
tained ; without which men would run from their wives
and children, to the dissolution of their families or in-
heritances.
R, C. Well, and what did she say to all this?
W. A. Sir, \ve' began our discourse in the following
n.snner, which I shall exactly repeat according to ray
men capacity, if you think it worth your while to honor
it with your attention.
DI'ALOGUE
WILL ATKINS AND HIS WIFE,
IV THE WOOD.
Wife. YOU tell me marriage God appoint, have you
God in your country?
W. A. Yes,'child, God is in every nation.
.. Wife. No, gf eat old Benamuckee God is in my country,
not yours.
W. A. My dear, God is in heaven, which he made; he
also made the earth, the sea, and all that is therein.
Wife: Why you not tell me much long ago?
W. Jt. My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, having
a long time lived without the knowledge of God in tlie
world.
Wife. What, not know great God in own natten ? No
do good ting? No say O to him ? that's strange?
W. A. But my dear, many live as if there was no God
in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God suffer them? why not makee live well?
Vf. A. It is our own faults, child.
Wife. But if he is much great, can makee kill, why no
makee kill when no serve him I No be good mans no cry
O to him?
W. A. That's true my dear, he may strike us dead, but
his abundant mercy spareth us.
Wife. Did not you tell God tankee for.that?
W. A No I have neither thanked him forv his mercy,
nor feared him for his power.
Wife. Then me not believe your God to be good, nor
makee kill, when you makee him angry.
W. A. Alas ! must my wicked life hinder you from be-
lieving in him?
Wife. How can me link your God live there? (fainting
to heaven) Sure he no ken what you do here.
W. A. Yes my dear, ho hears us speak, sees what we
do, and knows what we even think.
Wife. Where then makee power strong, when he hears
you curse, swear de great damn?
W. A. My dear, this shows indeed he is a God and not
a man, who has such tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy ! what you call mercy?
W. A He piues and spares us: as he is our great Cre-
ator, so he is also our tender Father.
Wife So God never angry, never kill wicked, then he
no good, no great mighty.
W A. O my dear, don't say so, he is both; and many
times he shows terrible examples of his judgment and ven-
geance.
Wife. Then you makee de bargain with him; you do
bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt other mans.
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
his goodness.
Wife. Well, and yet no makee you dead; and you give
him no tankee neither?
W. A. It is true, I am an ungrateful, unthankful dog,
that I am.
Wife. Why, you say, he makee you, why makee you
no much better then?
W. A. It, is I alone that have deformed myself, and
abused his goodness.
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no makee him
angry, no Ho bad ting.
W. A. You mean, my dear, that you desire I would
teach you to know God: alas ! poor dear creature, he
must teach thee, and not I. But I'll pray earnestly to him
to direct thee, and to forgive me, a miserable sinner;
(Hereupon he went a liltle distance, and kneeling down,
prayed earnestly to God to enlighten her mind, and to
pardon his sins; when this was done, they continued
their discourse thus.)
Wafe. What you put down knee for? For what hold
up hand? Who you speak to?
W. A. My dear, I bowed in token of submission to him
that made me, and prayed that he would open your eyes
and understanding.
Wife. And can he do that too ? And will he hear what
you say?
W A. Yes my dear, he bids us pray, and has given xis
promise that he will hear us.™
Wife. When did he bid you pray? What! do you
hear him speak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has spoken formerly to
good men from heaven : and by divine revelation they
have written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. O where that good book?
W. A I have it not now by me, but one time or other,
5 shall get it for you to read. Then he embraced her
with great affection.
Wife. Pray tell a mee, did God teachee them write
that book?
W A. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be God.
W:fe. What way, what rule you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches what is good just, and holy;
and forbids all wicked and abominable actions that incur
his displeasure.
Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he do all things
you s.iy he do, surely he hear me say O to him; he make
me good if 1 wish to be good ; he no kill me if 1 love him;
me tirik, believe him great God ; me say O to him, along
•with you, my dear.
Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made help'
kneel down by him, praying with the greatest fervency,
that God would instruct her by his Holy Spirit.^ and that
God by his providence would send them a Bible for both
S
their instructions. And such was the early piety of this
new convert, that she made him promise never to forsake
God any more, lest being made dead, as she called it, she
should not only want her instructor, but himself be mis-
erable in a long eternity.
Such a surprising account as this was, proved very af-
fecting to us both, but particularly to the young clergyman,
who was mightily concerned be could not talk to her him-
self. " Sir," said he, " there is something more to be
'' done to this woman than to marry her: I mean that she
'£ ought to be baptised." To this I readily agreed : " Pray,"
said he," ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to
"her of Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners, the nature
» of faith, and redemption in and by him, of the Holy Spi-
't rit, the resurrection,last judgment, and a future state ;','
but the poor fellow melted into tears at this question, say-
ing, that he had said something to her of these things, but
his inability to talk of them, made him afraid, lest her
knowledge of them shoul^frather make her contemn re-
ligion, than be benefited by it; but that if I would discourse
•with her, it would be vety evident my labour would not be
in vain. Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself
as interpreter between the religious priest and the woman,
I entreated him to go on; but surely never was such a
sermon preached by any clergyman in these latter daysi
•with so much zeal, knowledge and sincerity; in short,
he brought the woman to embrace the knowledgeof Christ,
and of redemption by him, with so surprising a degree
of understanding, that she made it her own request to be
baptised.
He then performed his office in the sacrament of bap-
tism, first, by saying some words over to himself in latin,
and then asking me to give her a name, as being her god
father, and pouring a whole dish-full <Jf water upon the
woman's head, he said," Mary, 1 baptise thee in the name
"of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?"
so that none could know of what religion he was. After
this, he pronounced the benediction in latin. Thus the
woman being made a Christian, he married her to Will
Atkins; which being finished, he affectionately exhorted
him to lead a holy life for the future.; and since the Al-
mighty, for the conviction of his conscience, had honor-
od him to. be the instrument of his wife's conversion, he
should nik dishonour the grace of God that while the say-
age was converted, the instrument should be cast away.
This ended a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and
agreeable 1 ever passed in my life.
The affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing
to goon board, whon the young man (whose mother was
starved) came to me, saying, that as he understood I had
a clergyman with me, who had married the Englishmen
with savages, he had a match to make between two Chris-
tians, which he desired might be finished before I depart-
ed. Thinking it was he himself that had courted his
mother's maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing rash-
ly upon the account of his solitarycircumstances ; that the
maid was an unequal match for him, both is respect to
substance and years; and that it was very probable he
would live to return to his own country, where he might
have a far better choice. At these words, smiling he in-
terrupted me, thanking me for my good advice ; ihat aa
he had nothing to beg of me hut a small settlement, with a
servant or two, or some new Wcessaries, so he hoped I
would not be unmindful of him when I returned to En-
gland, but give his letter to his friends ; and that when he
was redeemed, that plantation, and all its improvements
however valuable, should be returned to me again But
as for the marriage he proposed, that it was not himself,
but that it was between my Jack-of-all-trades and the maid
Susan.
-I was indeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this
Match, which seemed very suitable, the one being a very-
ingenious fellow, and the other un excellent, dextrous, and
sensible housewife, fit to be governess of the whole island;
so we married them the same day; and as I was her fa-
ther, and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome por-
tion, appointing her and her husband a convenient large
space of ground for their plantation. The sharing out of'
the land I left to Will Atkins, who really divided it very
justly, to every person's satisfaction ; they only desired
one general wriiing under my hand for the whole, which I
caused to be drawn up, signed and sealed to them, set-
ting out their bounds, and giving them a right to the fl%>le
possession of their respective plantations, with their flf*-
provements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rS .
of the island as my own property, and a certain rent for
every particular plantation, after eleven years. As to their
laws and government, I exhorted them to love oneanc-
ther; and as to the Indians who liverl in a nook by them-
selves, I allotted three of four of them plantations, and
th:' rest willingly chose to become servants to the other
families, by which means they were employed in useful
labour, and fared much belter than they did before. Be-
sides the savages being thus mixed with the Christiansi
the work of their conversion might be set on foot by the
!atter, in the clergyman's absence, to our equal satisfac-
tion. The young priest, however, was a little anxious lest
the Christians should not be willing to do their parlsin in-,
structing these poor Indians; I therefore told him we
should call them all together ; that he should speak to the
Spaniards who were Papists, and I to the English, who
were Protestants, and make them promise that they
would never nuike any distinction in religion, but teach
the general true knowledge of God, and his Son Jesus
Christ, hi order to convert the poor savages. And this,
indeed, they all promised ujuaccordingly.
When I came to Will /wlins' house, I found his bap-
tised wife, and the young woman newly married to my
Jack-of-all-trades, were become great intimates, and dis-
coursing of religion together. " O, Sir," says Will Atkins,
"when God has sinners to reconcile to himself he never
wants an instructor ; I knew I was unworthy of so good a
work, and therefore this wouug woman has been sent hi-
ther as it \vcre from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a
whole nation of savages." The young woman blushed, and
was going to rise, but I desired her to sit still, and hoped
that God would bless her in so good a work; and then
pulling out a Bible (which I brought on purpose in my
pocket for him.) " Here Atkins," said I, "here is ah as-
"sistant that perhaps you had not before." So confounded
was the poor man that it was some time before he could
speak; at last, turning to his wife, "My dear," he said,
"did I not tell you that God could hear what we said,
Here's the book J prayed for when you and I kneeled un-
der the bush :. God then heard us, and now has sent iti"
The woman was burprised,and thought really God hadsent
that individual book from heaven; butlturnedto the'young
v.-,>.•,,;m, and desired her to explain to the young convert,
that God may properly be said to answer our petitions
when4n the course of his providence,such particular things
came to pass as we petitioned for. This the young woman
did effectually } but surely Will Atkins' joy cannotj.be ex-
pressed ; no man being more thankful for anything in the
world, than he was for his Bible, nor desired it from a bet«
ter principle.
After several religious discourses, I desired the young
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when
she was starving to death with hunger ; to which she rea-
dily consented, and began in the following manner:
"Sir,"said she," all our victuals being gone, after I
had fasted one day, my stomach was very sickly, and at
the approach of night, I was inclined to yawning and
•sleepy. When I slept upon the couch three hours, I
awaked a little refreshed: three hours after, my stomach
being more and more sickly, I lay down again but could
not sleep, being very faint and ill. Thus 1 passed the se-
cond day With a strange variety, first hungry, then sick
again, with Teachings to vomit; that night I dreamed I
was at Barbadoes, buying plenty of provisions, and dined
heartily, but when I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly
sunk to find myself in the extremity of famine. There
was but one glass of wine, which being mixed with sugar,
I drank up ; but for want of substance to digest upon, the
fumes of it got into my head, and made me senseless for
some time The third day I was so ravenous and furious
that I could have eaten a little child if it had come in my
way; during which time I was as mad as any creature in
Bedlam. In one of these fits I fell down, and struck my
face against the corner of a pullet bed where my mistress
lay ; the blood gushed out of my nose, but by my exces-
sive bleeding, both the violence of the fever, and the ra-
venous part of the hunger abated. After this, I grew sick
again, strove to vomit, but could not; then bleeding a se-
cond time, I swooned away as dead; when I came to my-
self, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in my stomach, which
went off towards night, with a' longing desire for food.
1 took a draught of water and sugar, but it came up again;
then I drank water without sugar, and that staid with me.
1 laid me down on the bed, praying God would take me
away; after I had slumbered, I thought myself a-dying,
therefore recommended^ ly soul toGod, and wished some-
body would throw me into the sea All this while nij de-
parting mistress lay by me; the last bit of bread she had
she gave to her dear child, my young master. The morn-
ing after, I fell into a violent fit of crying, and after that
into hunger. J espied the. blood that came from my nose
S 2
V r .,
in a bason which I immediately swallowed up. At night
J had the usual variations, as the pain in the stomach,
sick, sleepy, and ravenous; and I had no thought but I
should die before morning. In the morning came on ter-
rible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my
young master's lamentations, by which I understood his
mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried," a
"sail! a sail!" hallooing as if they were distracted for
joy of that relief, which afterwards we received from your
hands."
Surely never was a more distinct account of starving to
death than this. But to return to the disposition of things
among my people, I did not take any notice to them of
the sloop I had framed, neither would I leave them the
two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they should
have separated, or turned pirates, and so made the island
a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober,pious peo-
ple: but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a
.promise to sent! them further relief from Brazil, as sheep,
Jiogs, and cows (being obliged to kill them at sea, having
no hay to feed them) I went on board the ship again, the
first of May, 1685, after having been twenty days among
them ; and next morning, giving them a salute of five
guns at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The third
day,, towards evening, there happening a calm, and the
current being very strong, we were drove to the N. N. E.
towards the land. Some houvs after we perceived the sea
covered as it were with something very black, not easily
at first to be discovered: upon which our chief mate as-
scending the shrouds a little way, and taking a view with
a perspective glass, he cries out, •' an army ! an army!"
"You fool," said 1, " what do you mean I"" Nay Sir,"
aaiti he, "don't be angry, I assure you it is not only an
'' army, but a fleet too, tor I believe there are a thousand
"canoes paddling along, and making with great haste to-
"wards us."
Indeed every one of us were surprised at this relation;
and my nephew the captain cou!J not tell what :0 think of
it, but thought we should all be devoured, Nor was J
free from concern, when I considered how much we were
becalmed, and what a strong current set towards the shore;
however, Tencouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the
ship to an anchor,as soon as we were certain that we must
'engage them. Accordmgly, we did so, and furled all our
sails ; as to the savages we feared nothing, but only that
they might set the ship on fire ; to prevent which 1 order-
ed them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the head and the other by the stern, well manned, with
skeets and buckets to extinguish the flames, should it so
happen. The savages soon come up with us, but there
were not so many as the mate had said, for instead of a
thousand canoes, there were only one hundred and twen-
ty; too many indeed for us, several of their canoes con-
taining about sixteen or seventeen men-
As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great-
est amazement, not knowing what to make of us. They
rowed round the ship, which occasioned us to call to the
men in the boats, not to suffer them to come near them.
Hereupon they beckoned to the savages to keep back,
which they accordingly did, but at the moment of their
•retreat, let fly about fifty arrows among us, and very much
wounded one of our men in the long-boat. Icalled to them
not tofire upon any account, but handing them down some
deal boards, the carpenters made them a kind of fence to
shield them from the arrows. In half an our after, they
came so near astern of us, that we had a perfect sight of
them; then they rowed a little farther out, till they came
directly along-side of us, and then approached so near,
that they could hear us speak : this made me order all our
men to keep close, and get their guns ready. In the mean
time I ordered Friday to go out upon deck, and ask them
in his language what they meant. No sooner did he do so,
but six of the savages who were in the foremost canoes,
•stooping down, showed us their naked backsides, as much
as to say in English, Kiss our :but Friday quickly
knew what ihis meant, by immediately crying out they
were going to shoot; unfortunately for him, poor crea-
ture, who fell under the cloud of three hundred arrows,
no less than seven piercing through his body killing one
of the best servants, and faithfullest of compassions in all
my solitudes and afflictions
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the
guns, which before were charged only with powder, to
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot;
toor did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broadside
split a; d overset thirteen or fourteen of their eanoes,which
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimming: the
others frightened out of their wits, little regarding their
fellows drowning, scoured away as fast as they could. One
poor wretch our people took up, swimming for his life, an
hour after. He was very sullen at first', so that he would
neither eat nor speak: but I took a way to cure him, by-
ordering them to throw him into the sea, which they did,
and then he came swimming back like a cork, calling in
his tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So we took him on
bosrd, but it was a long time before we could make him
speak or understand English ; yet .when we had tairght
him, he told us they were going with their kings to fight
a great battle ; and when we asked him what made them
come up to us, he said," to makee t'e great wonder look;"
where it is to be noted, that those natives, and those of
Africa, always add two e's at the end of English words,
as makee, takee, and the like, from which it is a very diffi-
cult thing to make them breuk off
Being now under sail, we took our last farewell of pboP
honest Friday, and interred him with all possible decency
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin, and committing
him to the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns to
be fired. Thus ended the life of one of the most affection-
ate, honest and faithful servants that ever any man was
blessed with.
Having new a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days
time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of
the line. Four days we kept on S. by E in sight of shore,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days we
came up to an anchor in the Bay of All Saints. 1 had
great difficulty here to' get leave to hold a correspondence
on-shore ; for neither the figure of my partner, my two
merchant trustees, nor the fame of my wonderful preser-
vation, in the island, could procure me the favor, till such
time as the prior of the monastery of St Augustine (to
whom I had given 5OO moidores) obtained leave from the
Governor, for me personally, with ihe Captain and one
aore,together with eight sailors, to come on shore ; upon
this condition, that we should not land any goods out of
the ship, nor carry away any person without licence: I
found means, however, to get on shore three bales of En-
glish goods, such as fine broad cloths, stuffs, and some
linen, which I brought as a present for my partner, who
had sent me on board a present of fresh provisions, wine,
and sweet-meats, worth about thirty moidores, including
some tobacco, and three or four fine gold medals.
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value of
1001. sterling, and I obligedhim tofitup the sloopl brought
for the use of my island, in order to send them refresh-
ments; and so active was he in this mailer, that he had
the vessel finished in a few days, to the master of which I
gave particular instructions to find the place. I soon load-
ed with him a small cargo ; and one of our sailors offered
to settle there, upon my letter to the Spanish governor,if
I would allot him tools and a plantation. This I willingly
granted, and gave him tire savage we had taken prisoner,
to be his slave. All things being ready for the voyage,
my old partner told me there was an acquaintance of his,
a Brazil planter, who having fallen under the displeasure
of the church, and in fear of the Inquisition, which oblig-
ed him to be concealed, would be glad of such an oppor-
tunity to make his escape, with his wife and two daugh-
ters; and if I would allot them a plantation in my island,
he would give them a small stock to begin with, for that
the officers had already seized his effects and estate, and
left him nothing but a little household stuff and two slaves.
This request I presently granted, concealing him and his
family onboard our ship, till such time as the sloop (where
all the effects were) was gone out of the bay, and then we
put them on board, who carried some materials,and plants
for planting sugar-canes, along with them. By this sloop
among other tilings, I sent my subjects three milch cows
and five calves, about 22 hogs, three sows big with pig,
two mares and a stone horse. I also engaged three Por-
tugal women to go for the sake of the Spaniards, which,
with the persecuted man's two daughters, were sufficient,
since the rest had wives of their own, though in another
country; all which cargo arrived safe, no doubt to their
exceeding- comfort, who with this addition, were about
sixty or seventy people, besides children.
At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left
me; for a ship being ready to set sail for Lisbon, he ask-
ed me leave to go thither; but I assure you, it was with
the greatest reluctance^ I parted from a person, whose
virtue and piety merited the greatest esteem.
From the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable
good voyage, steering for the most part S. E. We were
on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who
to direct all the ship's motions alter she arrived at the
Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days, for
stayi by charter party, at the several ports she was to go
to. At the Cape \ve only took in fresh water, and then
sailed for the coast of Coromandel; we were there inform-
ed that a French man of war of SO guns, and two large
merchant ships, were sailed for the Indies, but we heard
no more of them.
In tiur passage, we touched at the island of Madagas-
car, where though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and
treacherous, and go constantly armed with bows and lan-
ces, yet for sometime they treated us civilly enough; and,
in exchange for knives, scissars, and other trifles, they
brought us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took part-
ly for present victuals, and the remainder to salt for the
ship's use.
So curious was to view every corner of the world
where I came to, that I went on shore, as often as I could.
One evening when on shore, we observed numbers of the
people stand gazing at us at a distance. We thought our-
selves in no danger, as they had hitherto used us kindly,
However, we cut three boughs out of a tree, sticking
them, at a distance from us, which it seems, in that coun-
try, is not only a token of truce and amity, but when
poles or boughs are set up on the other side, it is a sign
the truce is accepted In these treaties, however, there is
one principal thing tobe regarded,that neither party come
beyond one another's three poles or boughs; so that the
middle space is not only secure, but is also allowed as a
market for traffic and commerce. When the truce is thus
accepted, they stick up their javelins and lances at the first
poles, and then the truce is at an end. This evening it
happened that a greater number of people than usual, both
men and women, traded among us for such toys as we
had, with such great civility, that we made us a little tent
of large boughs of trees, some of the men resolving to lie
on shore all night; but, for my part, I and some ethers
took our lodging in the boat, with boughs of trees spread
over it, having a sail spread at the bottom to lie upon.
About two o'clock in the morning we were awakened by
the firing of muskets, and our men crying out for help, or
else they would all be murdered. Scarce had we time to
get the boat ashore, when our men came plunging them-
selves into the witter, with about four hundred o( the
islanders at their heels. We took up seven of the men,
three of them very much wounded, and one left behind
killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so thick
among us, that we were forced to make a barricade, \vitU
boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from dan*
ger; and, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned
them a volley, which wounded several of the m, as we could
hear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of
day, and then making signals of distress to the shipgjrhicli
my nephew the captain heard and understood, he weighed
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then
sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us; but
we called to them not to come near, informing them of
our unhappy condition. However they ventured; when
one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in one hand,
and keeping our boat between him and our adversaries,
swam to us, and slipping our cables, they towed us out of
reach .of their arrows, and quickly after a broad-side was
given them from the ship, which made a most dreadful
havoe among them. When we got on board, we exam-
ined into the occasion of this fray. The men who fled in-
formed us that an old woman, who sold milk within the
poles, had brought a young woman with her, who carried
roots ov herbs, the sight of whom so much tempted our
men, that they offered rudenesss to the maid, at which the
old woman set up a great cry ; nor would the sailors part
with the prize, but carried heramong the trees, while the
old women went, and brought a whole army down upon
them. At the beginning of the attack, one of our men
was killed with a lance, and the fellow who began the mis-
chief, paid dear enough for his mistress, though as yet we
did not know what had become of him; the rest luckily
escaped. The third night after the action, being curious
to understand how affairs stood, I took the supercargo and
twenty stout fellows with me, and landed about two hours
before midnight, at the same place where those Indians
stood the night before, and there we divided our men into
two bodies, the boatswain commanding one, and I another.
It was so dark, that we could see nobody, neither did we
hear any voice near us; but by and by the boatswain fall-
ing over a dead body, we agreed to halt till the moon
should rise, which we knew would be in an hour after,
We perceived here no fewer than two and thirty bodies
upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Sat-
isfied with this discovery, I was for going on board again;
but the boatswain and the rest told me, they would make
a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, so they call-
ed, them, resided, asking me at the same time to go along
with them; for they did not doubt, besides getting a boo-
ty, but they should find Tom Jeffefy there, for that was
the unhappy man we missed. But I utterly refused to go
and commanded them back, being unwilling to hazard
their jives, as,the safety of the ship wholly depended upon
therrnf Notwithstanding all I could say to them, they all
left m| but one, and the supercargo ; so we three return-
ed to the boat, where a boy was left, resolving to stay till
they returned A.t parting I told them 1 supposed most
of them would run the same fate with Tom Jeffery. To
this they replied, " Come boys, come along, we'll warrant
"we'll come off safe enough ;" and soaway they went, not-
withstanding all my admonitions, either concerning their
own safety or the preservation of the ship. Indeed, they
were gallantly armed, every man having a musket, bayo-
net, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers, pole-axes and
hand granades They came to a few Indian houses at
first, which not being the town they expected, they went
farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they concluded
that she would be a sufficient guide, and so it proved ; for,
after they untied her, she led them directly to the town,
which consisted of about two hundred houses, several fa-
milies living in some of the huts together. At their arri-
val, all being in a profound sleep, the sailors agreed to di-
vide themselves into three bodies, and set three parts of
the town on fire at once, to kill'those that were escaping
and plunder the rest of the houses. Thus desperately re-
solved, they went to work; but the first party had not
gone far, before they called out to the rest, that they had
found Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran up to the
place, and found the poor fellow indeed hanging up na-
ked, by one arm, and his throat almost cut from ear to ear.
In a house that was hard by the tree, they found sixteen
or seventeen Indians who had been concerned in the fray
two or three of them being wounded, were not gone to
sleep: this house they set on fire first, and in a few min-
utes after, five or six places more in the town appeared in
flames. The conflagration spread like wild-fire,their hous-
es being all of wood, and covered, with flags or rushes.
The poor affrighted inhabitants endeavoured to run out to
save their lives, but they were driven back into the flames
\
by the sailors, and killed without mercy. At the first
house above mentioned, after the boatswain had slain tw»
with his pole-ax, he threw a hand granade into the house,
which bursting, made a terrible havoc, killing and wound-
ing most of them ; and their king and most of his train,
who were then in thai house, fell victims to their fury, ev-
ery creature of them being either smothered or burnt.
AlHhis while they never fired a gun, lest the peoplefcould
awaken faster, than they could overpower them, ifut the
fire awakened them fast enough, which obliged our fellows
to keep together in bodies. By this time the whole town
was in a flame, yet their fury rather increased, calling out
to one another to remember Tom Jeffery. The terrible
light of this conflagration made me very uneasy, and rous-
ed my nephew, the Captain, and the rest of his men, who
knew nothing of the matter. When he perceived the
dreadful smoke, and heard the gunsgo off, he readily con-
cluded his men were in danger; he therefore takes ano-
ther boat, and comes ashore himself, with thirteen men
well armed He was greatly surprised to see me and only
two men in the boat, but more so when I told him the
story; but though I argued with him, as I did with the
men, about the danger of the voyage, the interests of the
merchants and owners, and the safety of the ship, yet my
nephew, like the rest, declared, that he would rather lose
the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men should
be lost for want of help; and so away he went. For my
part% seeing him resolved to go, 1 had not power to stay
behind. He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve
men more, and then we marched directly as the flame
guided us. But surely never was such a scene of horror
beheld, or more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver
Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither
spared man, woman, nor child. .- • ; . -
The first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of
one of their habitations, before which lay four men and
three women killed, and two more burnt to death among
the fire, which was now decaying. Nothing could appear
more barbarous than this revenge; nor more cruel ihan
the authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and
the cry proceeded in proportion. We had not gone much
farther, when we beheld three naked woman, followed by
sixteen or seventeen men, flying with the greatest swift-
ness from our men, who shot one of them in our sight.
T
When they perceived us, whom they supposed also their
murderers, they set up a most dreadful shriek, and both of
them swooned away in the fright. This was a sight which
might have softened the hardest heart; and in puy we
look some waystolet them know we would not hurt them,
xvhile the poor creatures with bended knees, and lifted up
hands, made pitious lamentations to us to save their lives,
I ordered our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures
whatsoever; but being willing to understand the occasion
of all this, I went among these unhappy wretches, who
neither understood me,nor the good I meant them How-
ever, being resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I or-
dered the men to follow me We had not gone fifty yards
before we came up with the boatswain, with four of our
men at his heels, all of them covered with blood and dust
and in search of more people to satiate their vengeance.
As soon as we saw them, we called out, and made them
understand who we were ; upon which they came up to us,
setting up a halloo of triumph, in token that more help
•was come. "Noble Captain," said he totnynephew," I'm
glad you're come: we have not half done with these vil-
lainous hell-hound dogs ; we'll root out the very nation of
them from the ean.h, and Jkill more than poor Tom has
hairs upon his head :" and thus he -.venton till I interrupt-
ed him—"Blood-thirsty dog,"said I," will your cruelty
II never end ? I charge you touch not one creature more;
"stop your hands, and stand still, or you're a dead man
"this moment." " Why Sir," said he, '-you neither know
"whom you we protecting, nor what they have done : but
"pray come hither, and behold an instance of compassion
"if such can merit your clemency;" and with thai he
showed me the poor fellow with his throat cut, hanging
upon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breasts with rage,
which, however, I thought had gone too far, agreeable to
these words of Jacob to his sons Simeon and Ltvi: " Cur-
sed be their anger, tor it was fierce ; and their wrath, lor
it v.-as cruel." But this sight made my nephew and the
rest as bud as they: nay, my nephew declared, his con-
cern was only for his men; as for the people, not a soul
of them ought to live. Upon this, the boatswuin and eight
snore directly turned about,and went to finish the intended
iraijedy; which being out of my power to prevent. I return-
ed back from the dismal sight, and the piteous cries of the
unfortunate creatures, who were made victims to their fu-
ry. Indeed it was an egregious folly in me to return to the
boat with but one attendant, and I had very near paid for
it, having narrowly escaped forty armed Indians, who had
been alarmed by the conflagration : but passing the place
where they stood, I got to the boat accompanied by the
supercargo, and so went on board, sending the pinnace
back a gain, to assist the men in what might happen.
When I had got to the boat, the fire was almost extinguish-
ed, and the noise abated ; but I had scarce been half an
hour on board the ship, when I heard another volley giv-
en by our sailors, and a great smoke, which as I found
afterwards, was our men falling upon those houses and
persons that stood between them and the sea; but here
they spared the wives and children, and killed only men,
to the number of sixteen or seventeen. By the time they
got to the shore, the pinnixce and ship's boat were ready to
receive them, and they all got safe on board, not a man
of them having received the least hurt, except two, one of
whom strained his loot, and the other burnt his hand a lit-
tle ; for they met with no resistance, the poor Indians be-
ing unprepared, amazed and confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them, but par-
ticularly with the Captain, who instead of cooling the rage
of the men, had prompted them on to further mischief:
nor could he nu'kc me any other excuse, but that as he
was a man, he could not master his passions at the sight
of one of his men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest,
knowing they were not under my command, they took no
notice of any anger, but rather boasted of their revenge.
According to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed
about 150 men, women and children, besides burning the
town to ashes. They took their companion Tom Jeffery
from the tree, covered him with some of the ruins, and
so left him. But, however this action of our men might
seem to them justifiable, yet I always openly condemned
it with the appellation of the massacre cf Madagascar..
For tho" i he natives had slain this Jefftry, yet certainly he
was the first aggressor, by attempting to violate the chas-
tity of a young innocent woman, -vho had ventured down
to them, on the faith of a public cHpkulution, which was
so treacherously ^broken.
While we were under s*iU tnr boatswain would often
defend this bloody action, by saymg, that the Indians iwl
broke the truce the night before, by shooting one of our
men without just provocation: and what if the poor fellow
had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to
have been murdered in so villainous a manner: and that
they had acted nothing but what the divine laws commis-
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in
the same mind as before, telling them that they were mur-
derers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast
their voyage, for such an unparalleled piece of barbarity.
When we came to the Gulph of Persia, five of our men
who ventured on shore were either killed or made slaves
by the Arabians, the rest of them having scarce time to
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresh
with the just retribution of Heaven for such actions ; upon
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, " Whether
those men on whom the tow«r of Siloam fell were greater
sinners than the rest of the Galileans ? and besides, Sir,"
said he," none of these five poor men that are lost, were
with us at the massacre of Madagascar, as you call it,
and therefore your representation is very unjust, and your
application improper. Besities,"added he, " you are con-
tinuually using the men very ill upon this account, and
being but a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to bear
it; nor can we tell what evil designs you may have to
bring us to judgment for it in England ; and therefore, if
you do not leave this discourse, as also not concern your-
self with any of our affairs, I will leave the ship, and not
sail among such dangerous company."
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being often re-
peated, I- at length told him the concern I had on board
was none of his business: that I was a considerable owner
in the ship, and therelore had a right to speak in common,
and that 1 was no ways accountable to him, nor to any bo-
dy else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought
all had been over. At this time we were in the road of
Bengal, where going on shot e with the supercargo one day,
in the evening as I was preparing to go on board,one of the
men came 10 me, and told me, I need not trouble myself
to come to the boat, for that the cockswam and others
had ordered him not to carry me on board any more.
This insolent message much surprised me; yet I gave
him no answer to it, but went directly and acquainted the
supercargo, entreating him to go on board, and by ac-
quainting the Captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I
perceived would happen. But before I had spoken this
th'- matter was effected on board; for.no sooner was he
gone oft' in the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter,
and all the inferior officers, came to the quarter-deck, de*
siring to speak with the Captain ; and there the boatswain
made a long harangue, exclaiming against me, as before
mentioned, that, if I had not gone on shore peaceably, for
my own diversion, they by violence would haye compelled
me, for their satisfaction: that as they had shipped with
the Captain, so they would faithfully serve him; but if I
did not quit the ship, or the Captain, oblige me to it, they
would leave the ship immediately: hereupon, turning his
face about, by way of signal, they all cried out," ONE AND
"ALL ! ONE A.ND ALL.I" , M»%, . , -
You may be sure, that (hough my nephew was a man
of great courage, yet he. could not but he surprised at their
sudden and unexpected behaviour; and though he talked
stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them,,
that in common justice to me, who was a considerable
owner in the ship, they could not turn me as it were out of
my own house, which might bring their lives in danger,
should they ever be taken in England ; nay, though he
invited the boatswain on. shore to accommodate matters
with me ; yet all this I say signified nothing; they would
have nothing to do with me ; and they were resolved to gp
on shore if I came on board. "Well," said my nephew,
"if you are so resolved, permit me to talk with him, and
then I have done ;"and so he came to me, giving nu- an
account of their resolution, how one and all designed to
forsake the ship when I come on board, for which he was.
mightily concerned." I am glad to see you, nephew," said
I," and rejoice it is no worse, since they have not rebelled
against you; I only desire you to send my necessary things
on shore, with a sufficient sum of money, and I will fiat!
my way to England as well as I can." Though this griev-
ed my nephew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but
compliance : in short, all my necessaries were sent me, and.
so this matter was over in a few hours
I think I was now near a thousand leagues farther off
Ei.gland by sea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif-
ference, that I might travel by landover the Great Mogul's-
country to Surat, from thence to Bassora, by sen up the
Persian Gulph, then take the way of the caravans over th»
Arabian desert to Aleppo and Scanderoon, there take ship,
T a
ping »o Italy, and so travel by land into France, and frotn
thence across the sea to England.
My nephew left me two persons to attend me; one of
• them was his servant, and the other clerk to the purser,
who engaged to be mine I took lodgings in an English
woman's house, where several French, one English, and
two Italian merchants resided. The handsome entertain-
ment I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months,
considering what course I should take, bome English
goods I had with me of great value, besides a thousand
pieces of eight, and a letter for more, if there was such a
necessity. The goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and
bought here several good diamonds, which I could easily
carry about with me. One morning the English merchant
came to me, as being very intimate together," Country-
man,"said he," I have a project to communicate to you,
•which 1 hope wil! suit to both our advantage. To be short,
Sir, we are both in a remote part of the world from our
country; but yet in a place where men of business may
get a great deal of money. Now, if you will put a thou-
sand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship
to our satisfaction ; you shall be Captain, I will be mer-
chant ; and we'll go a trading voyage to China, for why
should we lie still like drones, while the whole world is in
a continual motion."
This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreea-
ble to my rambling genius; and the more so, because I
looked upon my countryman to be a very sincere person;
it required some time before we could get a vessel to our
* mind, and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we
bought a ship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and
gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese fore-
mastmen ; and, for want of others, made shift with Indian
seamen. We first sailed to Achin, in the island of Suma-
tra, and then to Siam, where we bartered our wares for
some arrack and opium,the last of which bore a great price
among ihe Chinese; in a word, we went up to Suskan,
making a very great voyage ; and after eight months time,
I returned to Bengal, vevy well satisfied with this adven-
ture, having not only got a sufficient quantity of money,
but an insight of getting a great deal more.
The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go
among the Spice Islands, and bring homo a load of cloves
the Manillas, or thereabouts ; islands belonging part-
ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerably.
We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we
made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo,
and several other places which I do not perfectly remem-
ber, and returning home in about five months time. We
soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them
away for the gulf; and in short, making five to one ad-
vantage, we were loaded with money
Not long after my friend and I had made up our ac-
counts, to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch
coaster from Batavia, of aboui two hundred tons. The
crew of this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that
there were not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage,and
the Captain having given out that he intended to g'> to
Europe, public notice was given that the ship was to be
sold No sooner did this come to our ears, but we bought
the ship, paid the master and took possession. We .would
also have very willingly entertamed some of the men;
but they having received their share of booty, were not to
be found, being altogether fled to Agra, the great city of
the Mogul's residence; and from thence went to travel to
Surp.i, and so by the sea to the Persian Gulph And indeed
they had reason to fly in this manner; for the truth of it
•was, the pretended Captain was the gunner only, and not
the commander ; that having been on a trading voyage,
they were attacked on shore by the Malayans, who killed
three men and the Captain ; after whose death the other
eleven men run away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal,
and left the mate and five men more on shore; but of this
affair we shall have occasion to speak more at length here-
after.
However they came by the ship, we thought we bought
it honestly; neither did we suspect any thing of the mat-
ter; when the man showed Ub a bill of sale for the ship
(undoubtedly forged)to one EmanuelClostershoved,which
name he went by. And so without any more to do, we pick-
ed us some Dutch and English seamen, resolving for ano-
ther voyage for cloves among the Philippine and Molucca
Islands: in short, we continued thus five or six years,tra-
dini; from,port to port with extraordinary success. In the
seventh year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing
to touch at Siam, and buy some rice by the way. In this
voyage,contrary winds beat us up and down for a consider-
able time among the islands in the Straits of Molucca. No
sooner were we clear of those rugged seas, but we per-
ceived our ship had sprung a lenk, which obliged us to put
into the river Cambodia, which lies northward of the
Gulph. and goes up to Siam.
One day as I was on shore refreshing myself, there
conies to me an Englisnman, who was gunner's mate on
board an English East India ship, riding up the river near
the city of Cambodia: "Sir," said he, " you may wonder
at my business, having never seen me in your life : but
tho' I am a stranger, I have something to tell you that ve-
ry nearly concerns you ; and indeed it is the imminent dan-
ger you are in has moved me to give you this timely no-
tice." " Danger!" said I, " what danger? I know of none
except my ship being leaky, for which I design to have her
run aground to-morrow morning-" " I hope you will be
better employed when you shall hear what I have to say
to you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen
leagues up this river; aboui three leagues on this side of
it,there lie two Dutch and threeEnglish ships. And would
you venture here without considering what strength you
have to engage them ?" 1 knew not what he meant by this
discourse, and turning short upon him, " Sir," said I,
"I know no reason I have to be afraid either of any Dutch
or English ships. I am no interloper, and what business
have they with me ?" "Well. Sir " said the man, "if
you do think yourselves secure, all as I can say, you must
take your chance; however, I am very sorry you are so
deaf to good advice; but I assure you if, you do not put
to sea immediately, you will be attacked by five long-boats
full of men, hanged yourself for a pirate , if you are taken,
and the particulars examined afterwards" '' I thought,
Sir,"added he," I might have met a better reception for
such a singular piece of service." "Sir," said I,1' 1 was
never ungrateful to any man , but pray explain yourself,
and I'll go on board this minute, whether the leak be stop-
ped or no." "Why, Sir,"said he, •' t0 be short, because
time is precious,the matter is this : You know well enough
that you was with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain
was murdered by the Malayans, with three of his sailors;
and that either you, or some who were on board you, ran
away with the slup> and are since turned pirates at sea.
Now, Sir, fhib is the sum of what I had to say, and I can,
positively assure you, that if you are taken, you will be ex-
ecuted without much ceremony, for undoubtedly you can-
not but be sensible what little law merchant ships show tc
pirates, whenever they fall into their hands"
"Sir,"said I," I thank you for your kind information;
"and though I am sure no man could come more honest-
"ly by the ship than 1 have done, yet knowing their enter-
"prize, and being satisfied of your honest intention, I "11 be
•' upon my defence."" Pr'thee, Sir," said the man," don't
"talk of being upon your defence, the best that you can
"make is to be out of danger; and therefore, if you have
"any regard for your life, and the lives of your men, take
"the advantage, without fail, of putting out to sea at high
"water; by which means,as you have a whole tide before
"you, you will be gone too far out of their reach before
"they can come down."
"1 am mighty well satisfied," said I," in this particu-
lar, and for your kindness, which merits my great esteem,
pray Sir, what amends shall I make you ?" he replied," I
know not what amends you are willing to make, because
you may have some doubts of its certainty: but to con-
vince you of the truth of what I say, I have one offer to
make to you. On board of one of the English ships, I
have nineteen months pay due me, and this Dutchman
that is with me has seven months pay due to him, which
if you will make good to us, we will go along with you.
If you shall find that there is nothing in what we have
said, then we shall desire nothing; but when you are con-
vinced that we have saved the ship, your life, and the lives
of the men, we will leave the whole to your generosity."
So reasonable did this every way appear, that I imme-
diately consented, and we went directly on board. As soon
as we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out, That
they had stopped the leak. '• Well, thank God-" said I,
"but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith'' "VW-gh,"
said he, " what is the meaning of this hurry ?" "Pray,
ask no questions," said 1," but all hand^ to work, without
losing a moment's time.'1 Upon which, in great surprise,
the Captain was calltd, who immediately ordered the an-
chor up; and although the tide was not quite down, yet,
being assisted by a little land breeze, we stood to sea. I
then cillled my partner into the cabin, and related the sto-
ry at lar£<% which was confirmed and more amplifier! by
the two naeu 1 had brought on board. Scarce bad wt fin-
ished our discourse upon this head, but a sailor carue'to
the cabin door, with a message from the Captain, thaf we
were chased by five sloops full of armed men. "Very
"well," said I," it is plain now there is something in it."
And so going upon deck, I told all the men there was a
design for seizing the ship,and of executing us for pirates;
and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us
and by one another? To which they unanimously replied
"That they would fight to the last drop of blood." I then
asked the Captain, which way he thought best for us to
manage the battle ? "Sir," said he, "the only method is
to keep them off with our great shot, as long as we are
able, and then have recourse to our small arms ; and when
these fail us, then retire to close quarters, when perhaps
the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open our
bulk heads, nor get in upon us." Mean time the gunner
was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of
the steerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and
small pieces of old iron; and the deck being4 cleared, we
prepared for an engagement, still, however keeping out
to sea. The boats followed us with all the sail they could
make and we could perceive the two foremost were En-
glish, which out sailed the rest by two leagues} and which
we found would come up with us: hereupon, we fired a
gun without ball, intimating that they should come to,
and we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley;
but finding them crowding after us, till they came within
shot, we took in our white, and hanging out the red flag,
immediately fired at them with ball: we then called to
them with a speaking trumpet, bidding them at their pe-
ril to keep off
But ail this signified nothing; for depending upon the
strength which followed them, they were resolutely bent
for mischief: hereupon I ordered them to bring the ship
to, by which means^, they lying upon our broadside, we
let fly at them atotfce, one of whom carried away the stern
of the hindermos' boat, and obliged them not only to take
down their sail, out made them run to the head of ihe
boat, to keep them from sinking, and so she lay by, hav-
ing enough of it. In the mean tune, we prepared to wel-
come the foremost boat in the same manner. While we
were doing this, one of the three (undermost boats came
up to the relief of that which was disabled, and took the
men out of her We again called to parley with UieiH;
but instead of an answer, one of the boats came under our
stern ; whereupon our gunner let fly his two stern chase
guns, but missing, the men in the boat shouted, and wa-
ving their caps, came on with greater fury. To repair
this seeming d-sgrace, the gunner soon got ready, and fir-
ing a second time, did a great deal of mischief among the
enemy. We waved again, and, bringing our quarter to
bear upon them, fired three guns more, when we found
the boat a sinking, and several men already in the sea;
hereupon, manning the pinnace, I gave orders to save as
many as they could, and instantly to come on board, be-
cause the rest of their boats were approaching ; accord-
ingly they did so, and took up three of them, one of whom
was almost past recovery ; and then crowding all the sail
we could, after our men came on board, we stood out far-
ther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the
chase, when they came up to the first two. Thus deliver-
ed from imminent rlanger, we changed our course to the
Eastward, entirely out of the course of all the European
ships.
Being now at sea,and inquiring more particularly of the
two seamen the meaning of all this, the Dutchman at once
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who sold
us the ship was an errant thief, who had run away with
her ; that the Captain was treacherously murdered on the
coast of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his
men; that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being oblig-
ed to have recourse to the woods for their safely, at length
escaped by means of a Dutch ship in its way to China,
which had sent their boat on shore for fresh water: That
after this, he went to Bauvia, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship (who had deserted the rest in their
travels) arrived, and there gave an account that the fellow
who ran away with the ship had sold her at Btngal to a
set of pirates, who went a cruising, and had already taken
one English and two Dutch ships, richly laden.
Now, tho' this was absolutely false, my partner truly
said, ihat our deliverance was to be esteemed .so much the
more, by reason, had we fallen into their hands, we could
have expected nothing from them but immediate death,
considering our accusers would have been our judges;. and
therefore his opmion was to return directly to Bengal,
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we
canic by the ship, of whom we bought her, and the like,
and where we were sure of some justice ; at least would
not be hanged first, and judged afterwards. I was at first
of my partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously
considered of the matter, I told him, we ran a great haz-
ard in attempting to return, being on the wrong side of
the straits of Molucca, and that if, upon alarm given, we
should be taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English else-
where, our running away would be sufficient evidence to
condemn us. This danger indeed startled not only my
partner, but like wise all the ship's company ; so we chang-
ed our former resolution, and resolved to go to the coast
of Tonquin, and so to that of China, where, pursuing
our first design as to trade, we might have an opportunity
to dispose of the ship some way or other, and to return to
Bengal in any country vessel we could procure. This be-
ing agreed to, we steered away N. N. E. about 50 leagues
off the usual course to the east, which put us to some in-
conveniences. As the wind blew steadily against us, our
voyage became more tedious, and we began to be afraid
of want of provision ; and what was still worse, we appre-
hended, that as those ships, from whose boats we had es-
caped, were bound to China, they mighx get before us, and
have given fresh information, which might create another
vigorous pursuit. Indeed, I could not help being griev-
ed, when I considered that I, who had never wronged or
defrauded any person in my life, was now pursued like a
common thief, and if taken to run the greatest danger of
being executed as such; and, though innocent, I found
myself under the necessity of flying for my safety; and
thereby escape being brought to shame, of which I was
even more affraid than of death itself. It was easy to read
my dejection in my countenance. My mind was oppres-
sed, like those unhappy, innocent persons, who being over-
powered by blasphemous and perjured evidences, wicked-
ly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin their reputation,
have no other recourse in this world to ease their sorrow,
but sighs, prayersi and tears. My partner seeing me so
concerned, encouraged me as well as he could; and after
describing to me the several ports of that coast, he told
me, he would either put me in on the coast of Cochinchi-
na, or else in the bay of Tonquin, from whence we might
go to Macao, a town once possessed by the Portuguese,
and where still many European families resided.
To this place we steered, and early next morning, came
in sight of the coast; but thought it advisable to put into
A small river where we could, either over land, or by the
ship's pinnace, know what vessels were in airy ports there-
abouts This happy step proved our deliverance }»for
next morning, there came to the b5y of Tonquin, two
Dutch ships, and a third without any colours ; and in the
evening two English steered the same course. The riv-
er where we were was but small, and run but a few leagues
up the country northward ; the country was wild and bar-
barous, and the people thieves, having no correspondence
with any other nation; dealing only in fish, oil, and such
gross commodities : and one barbarous custom they still
retained, that when any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked
upon their coast, they make the men prisoners or slaves;
so that now we might fairly say we were surrounded by
enemies both by sea and land.
As the ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity,
in this place, to search her, and to stop up the places which
let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, and
bringing our guns and other moveable things to one side,
we essayed to bring her down, that we might come to her
bottom: but upon second consideration, we did not think
it safe to let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used to such
a sight as to see a ship lie down on the side, and heel in
towards the shore, and not perceiving hermen,who were
at work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-
side presently imagined the ship had been cast away, and
lay fast on the ground. Agreeable to this supposition,
they surrounded us with ten or twelve large boats, with a
resolution, undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and to carry-
away those they found alive for slaves to their king. But
•when they perceived our men hard at work on the ship's
bottom and side, washing, graving,and stopping her, it fill-
ed them all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as
though they were confounded. Nor could we imagine
•what their designs was; however, for fear of danger, we
handed downs arms and ammunition to those at work, in
order to defend themselves; and indeed, this precaution
was absolutely necessary; for in a quarter of an hour af-
ter, the natives, concluding it was really a shipwreck, and
that we were saving our lives and goods, which they
thought belonged to them, came down upon our men, as
though it had been in line of battle. We lay at present
but in a very unfit posture to fight; and before the stages
could be got down, or the men in the boat come on board
as they were ordered, the Cochinchinese were upon them,
and two of their boats boarding our long-boat, they began
to lay hold of our men as prisoners. The first they seiz-
ed was a stout English sailor, who never fired his musket,
like a fool as I imagined, but laid it down in the boat: but
he knew what he was doing; for, by main force, he drag-
ged the Pagan out of the boat into ours by the two ears
and knocked his brains out against the boat's gunnel; a
Dutchman that was next him snatched up the musket,
and knocked down five more with the butt-end of it; how-
ever, this was doing very little to their number; but a
strange unexpected accident, which rather merits laugh-
ter tlmn any thing elset gave our men a complete victo-
ry over them.
It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let
down in the boat, one filled with boiling pilch, and the
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship-
wrights use; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff,
and us two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel-
low stood he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boil-
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked
made ihem roar out, and jump into the sea. " Well done
** Jack," says the carpenter, " give them the other dose :'*
and so steppiogforward himself, takes a mop, anddipping
it into the puch-pot,heand his man so plentifully slung it
among them, as that none escaped being scalded; upon
which they all made the best of their way, crying and
howling in such a frightful manner, that,in all my adven-
tures, I never heard the like. And indeed, never was I
better pleased with any conquest thanlwas with this,there
being so little blood shed, and having an aversion to killing;
such savage wretches (more than was necessary) as know-
ing they came on errands, which their laws and customs
made them think were just and equitable. By this time,
all things being in order, and the ship swimming, they
found their mistake, so they did not venture a second at-
tack Thus ended our merry fight; and having got rice,
bread, roots, and sixteen good hoi^s on board the day be-
fore we set sail, not daring to go into she bay of Tonqum,
but steered N. E. toward the isle of Formosa, or as thV
we would go to the Manillas, or Philippine islands, for
fear of meeting with any European ships; when we an-
chored at the isle of Formosa, the inhabitants not-only
courteously supplied us with provisions and fresh water,
but dealt fairly, and honestly, with us in their bargains
and agreements. From this place we steered north, keep-
ing still off the coast of China, till we were beyond all its
ports where European ships usually come ; and at length,
being come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved
to put into the first trading port we should come at; and
standing for the shove, a boat came off two leagues to us,
•with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who offered his ser-
vice ; we very" gladly accepted him, and sent the boat back
again. And now, having the old man on board, I talked
to him of going to Nanquin, the most northward part of
the coast of China. "What will you do there ?" said he,
smiling. I told him we would sell our cargo, and pur-
chase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, lea, Sec. and so re-
turn the same way back. "O," said he, & you had better
put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares as cheap
as at Nanquin, and sell your opium a,t a greater advance."
"But," said I, '' we are gentlemen, as well as merchants,,
and design to see the great city of Pekin, and the magnifi-
cent court of the monarch of China." " Why, then," said
he, " you should go to Ningpo, where there is a naviga-
ble river that goes through ihe heart of that vast empire
two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea, which
crosses all the rivers, passes considerable hills, by the help
of the sluices and gates, and goes even up to the city of
Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you please, and trav-
el to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound
that way." -At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I
was struck with confusion ; they being as great a terror to
me in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is>to them
in the Mediterranean. The old man finding me troubled,
"Sir," said he, " I hope the Dutch are not now at war
"with your nation." "No," said I, '' but God knows what
"liberty they may take when out of the reach of the law."
"Why," says he," what occasion is there for peaceable
"merchants to fear ? For, believe me, they never meddle
"with any but Pi RATES."
At the mentioning the word pirates, my countenance
turned to that of scarlet; nor was it possible for me to con-
ceal it from the old pilot; who taking notice of it," Sir,"
said he, " take what course you please, I'll do you all tfts
"service I can." "Seignior," said I," I am a little sur-
prised at your mentioning pirates ; I hope there are none
such in these seas, because you see in what weak condition
we are to defend ourselves." " O Sir," said he, " if that's
all, don't be qoncerned,for I don't remember one in these
sca% these fifteen years, except about a month ago, one
was seen in the bay of Siam, but he has gone to the south-
ward; neither was she built for a privateer, but was run
away with by a reprobate captain, and some of his men,
the right captain having been murdered by the Malayans."
"YVhat," said I, "did they kill the captain I" " No,"
said he, '' it is generally thought the Malayans murdered
him; but perhaps they might procure them to do it. and
Therefore they justly deserve hanging. The rogues were
lately discovered in the bay of Siam, in the river of Cam-
bodia, by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and
had much ado to escape the five boats who pursued them,
but they have solemnly swom to give no quarter to the
captain or the seamen, but hang them every one up at the
yard-arm, without any formal business of bringing them
to a court martial."
Being sensible that having the old man on board,he was
incapable of doing me any michief, well, Seignior, said J,
"it is for this very reason I would have you carry us up to
Nanquin, where neither English nor Dutch ships come;
and I must tell you their Captains are a parcel of rash,
proud, insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs to
justice, nor to behave themselves as the laws of God or
nature direct: fellows that would prove murderers to pun-
ish robbers, and take upon them to adjudge innocent men
to death, without any proof to prove them guilty; but per-
haps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed."
And so I told him all the story of buying the ship, and how
we were saved by means of two men: that the murder of
the Captain by the Malayans, as also the running away
with the ship, I believed to be true ; but that we who bo't
it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover their
cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked us,
and the blood of those men we killed in our own just de-
fence, lay at their door, who sent to attack us by surprise,
. " Sir," said the old man amazed," you have taken the
right course to steer to the north, and if I might

you, I would rather have you sell the ship in China, 'and
buy, or build another in that country; and I'll procure
people to buy the one and sell the other." "Well, but
Seignior," said I, "if I sell the ship in this manner, I
may bring some innocent persons into the same dangers
I have gone through, perhaps worse, even death itself;
whereby I should be as guilty of their murder as their vil-
lainous executioners." "That need not trouble you,"
said the old man, " I'll find a way to prevent that; for
these commanders you talk of, I know very well, and will
inform them rightly of the matter as you have related, and
I am persuaded they will not only believe me, but act
more cautiously for the future." " And will you deliver one
message from me to them ?" " Yes," said he, "if you will
give it under your hand, that I may prove it is not of my
own production." Hereupon I wrote a large account of
their attacking me in their long boats, the pretended rea-
son and unjust design of it; that they had done what they
might be ashamed of. and could not answer in any tribu-
nal in England. But this letter was wrote in vain. Provi-
dence ordered things in another way. We sailed direct-
Jy for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days sail, came to an
anchor at the south-west point of the great Gulph of that
place, where we learned that two Dutch ships were gone
the length before us, and that we should certainly fall
into their hands. We were all at a great loss in this ex-
igency, and would very gladly have been on shore almost
any where; but our old pilot told me that if I would sail
to the southward about two and forty leagues, there was
a little port called Quinchange, where no European ships-
ever came, and where we might consider what was fur-
ther to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor the
next day, calling only twice on shore by the way, to get
fresh water. The country people very courteously sold
us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. About
£••-•> days sail brought us to the port, where we- landed
with unspeakable joy. We resolved to dispose of our-
selves and effects in any other way possible, than enter on,
board that ill fated vessel any more ; for no state can be
more miserable than a continued fear, which is a life of
death, a confounder of our understandings, that sets the
imagination at work to find a thousand dreadful things
that may never happen. And we scarce slept one night
without dreaming of halters, yard-arms and gibbets, or of

U 2
fighting, being taken, and being killed ; nay, so violent
were our apprehensions that we would bruise our hands
and heads against the sides of the cabin, as though actual-
ly engaged. The story of the Dutch cruelty at Amboyna,
often came into our thoughts when awake ; and for my
part, I thought my condition very hard, that after so many
difficulties and such signal deliverences, 1 should be
hanged in my old age, though mnocent of any crime that
deserved such punishment; but then religion would seem
to represent to me, as though the voice of it had said, con-
sider, O man! what sins you have been guilty of; which
now thou art called to an account for, to expiate with thy
blood ! and as to thy innocence, what art thou more inno-
cent than thy blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ, who suffer-
ed for thy offences, and to whose providence you ought
to submit, let what will happen? After this, natural cour-
age would inspire me to resist to the last drop of blood,
and sooner die than suffer myself to be taken by boish,or
rascdly Dutchmen, who had arts to torment beyond even
death itself.
But now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore, our old pi-
lot procured us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods;
it was a little hut, with a large warehouse belonging to it,
all built with canes,and pallisadoed round with large ones,
to keep out pilfermg thieves, which are very numerous in
tha- quarter The magistrates allowed us a little guard
during the night, and we employed a centinel with a kind
of halbert for three pence a day. The fair, or mart, we
.found had been over for some time ; however there re-
mained in the river four junks and two Japun ships, the
merchants of the latter being on shore. In the first place
our old pilot brought us acquainted with the missionary
Roman priests, who were converting the peopte to Chris-
tianity : two of them were reserved, rigid, and austere,
applying themselves to the work they eame about with
great earnestness: but the third, who was a Frenchman,
called Father Simon, was of a freer conversation, not seem-
ingly so serious and grave, yet no worse Christian than
the other two, one of whom was a Portuguese, and the
Other a Genoese. Father Sin.on, it seems, was appointed
to go to Pekin, the royal seat of the Emperor of the Chi-
nese; and he only waited for another priest who was or-
dered fron, Macao to accompany him. We never met
together, but he was prompting me to accompany him in
that journey: "Sir," said he," I will shew you the glo-
rious things of this mighty Empire, and a city, the city of
Pekin, far exceeding London and Paris, put them both
together." One day in particular being at dinner with him,
Ishowed some inclination to go; which made him press
the more upon me and my partner, to gain our perfect
consent. "But father Simon," said i " what satisfaction
can you have in our company who-n you esteem as here-
tics, and consequently objects not worthy of your regard."
"O," said he, " you may be as good Catholics in time,
"as those I hope to convert to our religion." "And so,"
said I, '• we shall have you preaching to us all the way, in-
*' stead of pleasing us with a description of the country."
"Sir," said he, "however our religion may be villifk-d by
"some people, it is very certain it neither divests us of
"good manners or Christian charity: and as we are gcn-
'' tlemen, as such we may converse together, without
"making one another uneasy."
But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and
the i, erchandise which we had to dispose of. There was
but very little trade in the place where we were; and I
was once resolved to venture to sail totheiiver Kilam, and
so to the city uf N^nquin; but Providence ordered it other-
wise, by our old pilot's bringing a Jipan merchant to us, to
see what goods we had. He immediately bought our opi-
um, for which he gave us u very good price in gold by
weight, some w*edges of which were about ten or eleven
ouRres. It came into my head that perh.ips he might ouy
the ship too ; and 1 ordered his interpreter to propose it to
him He said nothingthen, but shrugged up hisshouldtrs;
yet in a few days after he came accompanied by a mission-
ary priest, who was his interpreter, with this proposal.
"That as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, he
had'not money enough to purchase our ship ; but if I pleas-
ed he would hire her, with all my men, to go to Japan,and
from thence with another loading to the Philippine islands,
the freight of both whit h he would very willingly pay to
us before; and at their return to Japan,would buy the ship."
Upon this we asked the Captain and his men, if they were
•willing to go to Japan ; to which they unanimously agreed.
While this was in agitation, the young man my nephew
left to attend me, told me, "That as I did not care to ac-
cept this prospect of advantage, he would manage it fop
ihe as I pleased, and render me a iaahiui account of Jits
'success, which would be wholly mine." Indeed I was ve-
ry unwilling to part with him; but considering it might
be for the young man's good, I discoursed with my part-
ner about it, who, of his own generosity, gave him his
share of the vessel, so that I could do no otherwise than
give him mine: but however, we let him have but the
proper half of it, and preserved a power that when we
met in England, if he lidd obtained success, he should ac-
count to us for one half of the profits of the ship's freight,
and the other should he his own. Thus having taken a
writing; under his hand, away he sailed to Japan, where
the merchant dealt very honestly by him, got him a li-
cence to come on shore,sent him loaded to the Philippines,
with a Japanese supercargo, from whence he came back
again loaded with European goods,cloves and other spice-
ries. Uy this voyage he cleared a considerable sum of mo-
ney, which determined him not to sell his ship,but to trade
on his own account; so he returned to the Manillas,
where getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, was
hired by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in A-
reerica, on the Mexican coast, with a licence to travel to
the great city of Mexico This traffic turned out greatly
toaccount, and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica,
returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England.
In parting with the ship, it comes in course to consider
of those men who saved our lives when in the river of
Cambodia; and tho' by the way, they were a couple of
rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we
paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each
of them a small sum of money, making the Englishman,
a gunner, and the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they
were very well contented.
We were now about 1000 leagues farther from home
than when at Bengal. All the comfortwe could expect was,
that there being another fair to be kept in a month's time,
we might not only purchase all sorts of that country's ma-
nufactures, but very possibly find some Chinese junks, or
vessels from Tonquin, to be sold, which would carry us and
our goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes, we
resolved to continue ; and to divert ourselves, we took sev-
eral little journies in the country. About ten days after we
parted with our ship, we travelled to see the city of Nan-
<juin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north of the line:
it is regularly built, and the streets are exactly straight,
and cross one another in direct lines, which sets it out to
the greatest advantage. At our return, we found the priest
was come from Macao, that was to accompany father Si-
mon to Pekin. That father earnestly solicited me to ac-
company him, and I referred him to my partner In
short, we both agreed, and prepared accordingly ; and we
•were so luckly as to have liberty to travel among the reti-
nue of one of their Mandarine, who is a principal magis-
trate, and much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling through this
miserable country, infinitely populous, but as indifferent-
ly cultivated; and yet their pride is infinitely greater
than their poverty, insomuch that the priest derided
them. As we passed by the house of one of their country
gentlemen, two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honor,
forsooth, to ride with the Chinese squire about two miles.
Never was Don Quixote so exactly! Never was such a
compound of pomp and poverty seen before!
His liabit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very
proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with all its
tawdry trappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, &c. though
torn and rent in almost every part; his vest underneath it
was no less dirty but more greasy, resembling the most
exquisite sloven or greasy butcher: his horse (worse than
Rosinante, or the famous steed of doughty Hudibras) was
a poor starved decriped thing, that would not sell for thir-
ty shillings in England ; and yet this piece of worshipful
pomp was attended with ten or twelve slaves who guarded
their master to his counti y-seat. We stopped at a little vil-
lage for refreshment; and when we came by the country,
seat of this great man, we found him sitting under a tree
before his door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great
piece of garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green
pcpperby him,andanother plant like ginger,together with
a piece of lean mutton in it: this was his worship's repast:
but pray observe the state of his food! two women slaves
brought him his food, which being laid before him, two
others appeared to perform their respective offices; one
fed him with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell
on his beard and taffety vest and gave it to a particular fa-
vorite to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased with
the conceit of our admiring his magnificence, which rather
merited our scorn and detestation,-
At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accom-
panied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot,
•whose charges we bore, and who served us as an interpre-
ter by the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but
he comes laughing to us," Ah !Seignior Inglise," said he,
"me something tell you make your heart glad, but make
me sorry: for you bring me here twenty-five days journey,
and now you leave me go back alone ; and which way shall
I make my port after, without de ship, without de horse,
without pecune ?" so he called money in.his broken latin.
He then informed me, that there was a great caravan of
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who were pre-
paring to set out for Muscovy by land within six weeks;
and that he was certain we would take this opportunity,
and consequently that he must go home by himself. In-
deed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me. "Are
you certain of this ?" said 1. "Yes, Sir," says he, " me
sure it's true." And so he told me, that having met an old
acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street, who was
among them, and who had come from Astracan, with a
design to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having al-
tered his resolutions, he was now resolved to go with the
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to Astracan.
"Well, Seignior," said I, " don't be discontented about
your returning alone ;and if by this means, I can find a
passage to England, it will be your own fault if you return
to Macao at all." And so consulting with my partner what
was best to be done, he referred it to me as I pleased, hav-
ing our affairs so well settled at Bengal, that if he could
convert the good voyage he had made in China silks
•wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to England,
and so return to Bengal, in the Company's ships. Thus
resolved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we
would bear his charges eitherto Moscow, or England ; and
to give him in a present the sum of one hundred and sev-
ent'ypounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and
told him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if
he would accompany us with the caravans ; and therefore,
we desired to know his mind. At this he shook his head,
"Great long journey," said he, " me no pecune carry me
to Moscow, or keep me there." But we soon put him out
of that concern, by making him sensibleof what we would
give him here to lay out to the best advantage; and as for
l»s charges, we would set him safe on shore, God willing,
either in Moscovy, or England, as he pleased, at our own
charge, except ihe carriage of his goods. At this propo j
sal, he was like a man transported, telling us, he would
go with us all the world over ; and we made preparations
for our journey; but it was near four months before all
the merchants were ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went ex-
press to the port where we first put in, to dispose of what
goods had been left there, while I accompanied a Chi-
nese merchant who was going to Nanquin, and there
bought twenty-nine pieces of damask, with about three
hundred more of other fine silks; and by the time my
partner returned to Pekin, I had them all .carried there;
our cargo in silks amounted to 45001. sterling, which, to-
gether with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded
eighteen camels for our share, besides what we rode upon
with two or three spare horses, and two more loaden with
provisions; the company now was very great, making
about four hundred horse, and above one hundred and
twenty men, well armed and provided- We were of
several nations, among whom were five Scotch merchants,
inhabiting in Moscow, and well experienced in trade.
We set out from Pekin the beginning of February our
style ; and in two days more, we passed through the gate
of the great China wall,which was erected as a fortification
against the Tartars,being one hundredEnglish miles long!
We then entered a country not near so populous, chiefly
under the power of plundering Tartars, several companies
of whom we perceived riding on poor starved horses, con-
temptible as themselves,without order crdiscipline. One
time our leader, for the day gave us leave to go a hunting;
but what do you think we hunted ? only a parcel of sheep,
which indeed exceeded any in the world for wildnessand
swiftness ; but while we were pursuing this game, it was
our chance to meet with <tl>out forty Tartars, who no soon-
er perceived us, but one of rhem bit, w a horn, at the sound
of which there soon appeared a troop of forty or fifty more,
at about a mile's distance Hereupon $ne of the Scots mer-
chants (who knew their ways) ordered us to advance to-
wards them, and attack them immediately. As we ad
vanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happily fell
a little short of us ; this made us halt a iiule, to return the
compliment with bullets ; and th'tn being led up by the
bold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and drew our
swords; but there was no occasion; for they flew like,
timorous sheep, and only three of them remained, beck-
oning to the rest to come buck But our brave command-
er gallops up to them by himself, shot one dead, knocked
another off his horse, while the third ran away ; and thus
ended our battle with the Tartars
We travelled a month more through the Emperor of
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of their
towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of
Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. 1'he person I spoke to
would have brought me one, but like a fool, I must go
along with,him, about two miles from the village. My
old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety,
•when coming to the place where the camels were kept as
in a pack guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed
and bought one, which the Chinese man that came along
with me led along the road. But we had not gone farf
before we were attacked by fiveTartars,mountedon horse-
back, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from
him, and rode away, while the other three approached us,
the first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing
my sword, the second knocked me down, but my old irus-
ty Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I
knew nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck
me, he with one hand pulled him off his horse, and then
shot him dead upon the spot ; then taking his scymitar,he
struck at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cut
off one of his horse's ears, the pain of which made him
throw the rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who
had led the camel, seeing the Tartav down, runs to him,
and seizmg upon his pole-ax, wrenched it from his hands,
and knocked his brains out But there was another Tar-
tar to deal with, who seeming neither inclined to fight nor
fly, and my old man having began to charge his pistol, the
very sight of it struck such a terror into the wretch, that
away he scoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my cham-
pion and defender, an absolute victory.
By this time being awakened from my trance, I began
to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having quite
forgot all that passed; but my senses returning, and feel-
ing a great pain in my head,and seeing the blood was run-
ning over my clothes, I instantly jumped upon my feet,
and grasped my sword in my hand, with a resolution to
revenge; but no enemies now remained except vhe
dead Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The old man
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards
me, and embracedme with the greatest tenderness, at the
same time examining into my wound, which was far from
being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man
demanded payment for his camel, which I refusing, we
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with
great impartiality: Having heard both sidesrhe asked the
Chinese man that went with me, whose seryant he was?
"Sir,"said he," I am nobody's, but went with the stranger
at his request :" " Why then," said the judge, " you are
the stranger's servant for the time, and the camel being
delivered to his servant, it is the same as though delivered
to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it." Indeed
the case was so fairly stated, that I had nothing to object
o it ; so, having paid for that I was robbed of, I sent for
another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as 1 had enough
of that sport before.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese Empire,
so fortified, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars
cannot batter down their walls; by which certainly one
might think one of our cannons would do more execution
than all their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that cky, we had
information that the governor had sent messengers to eve-
ry part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans
to halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the nu-
merous bodies of Tartars fhat lately appeared about the
city. This news put us into great consternation; but obey-
ing the orders, we stopt; and two days after, there came
two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese, and
three .mndred more from Naum ; thus guarded both in
the front and rear, with our own men in the Hanks, we bold-
ly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with ten
thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
Early next morning, in our march from a little well situ-
ated town called Changu, alter having passed a river, and
•entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over,
we soon beheld, by a cloud of dust that was raised, that
the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the
Chinese. My old pilot took notice of it, and called out,
"Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be encouraged, or
they will ruin us all; and I am afraid if the Tartars at-
tack us, they will all run away." " Why Seignior,"said J,
W
« what shall be done in this case ?" •' Done," says he, "why
let fifty of your men advance,und flank them on each wing.
I know the fellows will fight well enough in company."
We accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the
right wing, and the same number to the left, and with the
rest made a line of reserve, leaving, the two last hundred
men to guard the camels, or to assist us, as occasion re-
quired.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward,
viewing our posture,and traversing the groundonthe iront
of our line Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move
on, and give them a salute with their shot, which accord-
ingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings ; for
immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched
away and we saw no more of them. They had undoubted-
ly given an account to their companions of what reception
they might expect, which made them so easily give over
their enterprize.
When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the
governor hearty thanks,and distributed a hundred crowns
among the soldiers that guarded us. We rested there one
day, and then proceeded on our travels, passing several
great rivers and deserfs, and on the 13th of April we came
to the frontiers of Muscovy, the first town 'of which was
(tailed Argun.
This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming into »
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scots mer-
chant upon it. He smiled at that, telling me not to rejoice
too soon; u tor/* said he, a except the Russian soldiers
in garrison, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon the
road, all the rest of this country, for above a thousand
miles, is inhabited by the most ignorant and barbarous
Pagans."
We advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate jour-
nies,dnd found convenient garrisons on the road.filled with
Christian soldiers, for the security of commerce, and for
the con vi nieinlodgingsof travellers: buttfeeinhabitams of
the country were mere pagans,worshipping the sun.moon,
and stars. We particularly observed this idolatry near the
river Aiguna, at a city inhabited hy Tartars ami Russians,
called Ncrisinkey. Being curious to see their way of liv-
ing, while the caravan continued to rest themselves in that
city, I went to\one of their villages, where there was to
5*9 one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld, upon
the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly than
the representation of the devil himself: its head resem-
bled no living creature; its ears were as big and high
as goat's horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered mouth,and
horrible teeth : it was clothed in sheep skins, had a great
Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing thro' it, and was
eight feet high, without feet, tegs, or proportion. Before
this idolthere lay sixteen orseventeen people,who brought
their offerings, and were making their prayers, whileat a
distance stood three men, and one bullock, as victims to
this ugly monster.
Such stupendous sacrilege as this, in robbing the true
God of his honor, filled me with the greatest astonishment
and reflection -, which soon turning to rage and fury,l rode
up to the image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that was on
his head with my sword, so that it hang down by one of
the horns, while one of my men that was with me pulled
at it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an hideous
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two or
three hundred people coming about our ears, we were
obliged tody for it.
But I had not done with the monster, for the caravan
being to rest three days in the town, I told the Scots mer-
chant whutil had seen, and that I was resolved to take four
or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the
idol, and show the people how little reason they had to
trust in a god who could not save himself. At first helaugh-
ed at me, representing the danger ot it, and when it was
destroyed, what time had we to preach to them better
things, whose zeal and ignorance was in the highest de-
gree, and both unparalleled ? thai if I should be taken by
them, I should be served as a poor ruffian who contemned
their worship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the
top of the idol, there shot at wkh arrows till my body was
full of them, and then burnt as a> sacrifice to the monster j
"but Sir," said he," since your zeal carries you so far
rather than you should be alone I will accompany you, and
bring a svout fellow equal to yourself, if you| will, to ussist
you in this design: and according he brought one Cap-
tainRichardson, who hearing the st»ry, readily consented ;.
but my partner declined it, being altogetherout ofhis way r
and so we three, and my servant, resolved fo execute this
exploit about niidnight; but upon second thoughts we de-
ferred k to the next night,,by reason that the caravan being
to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of
the governor's power. The better to effect my design, I
procured a Tartar's sheep skin K>be, a bonnet, with bow
and arrows, and every one of us got the like habits. The
first pight we spent in mixing combustible matter with
aqua vitae, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar
in a little pot; next night we came upj to the idol about
eleven o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guard-
ing It; but we perceived a light in the house, where we
had seen the priest before. One of our men was for firing,
the hut,'another for killing the people, and a third for mak-
ing them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We
agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, we seized the
first that opened it and stopping his mouth and tying his
feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like man-
ner; and then the tjcots merchant set fire to the compo-
wition, which frightened them so much,'that we brought
them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we feU
tp,Work with him.daubing him all over with tarmixed with
tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and^mouth
full of.gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire- in hii}
bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. AH this being
done, we unloosed andungagged the prisoners and set the
idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up the. shape,
of it was deformed, rent,, and split, which the forage utter-.
ly consumed; for we staid to see its destruction, lest the
ignorant idolatrous people should have thrown themselves
in the flames.. Aud thus we came away undiscovered, in
the morning appearing as busy among our fellow travel-,
lers, as no body could have suspected any other, but that
we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we set out, and had gone but a small
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding
satisfaction of the Russian governor for insulting their
priests, and burning- their great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who
dwell in the sun, and no mortal would violate this image
but some Christian miscreants ; and being already no less
than thirty thousand strong, they announced war against
him and all his Christians.
The governor assured them he was ignorant of the mat-
ter, and that none of his garrison had been abroad; that in-
deed there was a caravan that went away that morning, ami
(hat he would send after them to enquire into it; and who-
«ver was the ofiendcr,should be delivered into their hands.
This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent
to inform us, that if any of us hud' done it, we should
make all the haste away possible, while he kept them in
play as long as he could. Upon this we marched two days
and two nights, stopping but very little, till at last we ar-
rived at a village called Plothus, and hasted to Jerawena,
another of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having
entered the desert, and passed the lake called Shak-s O*er,
we beheld a numerous body of horse on the other side of
it to die north, who supposed we had passed on that side of
the lake; but either having found the mistake, or being
certainly informed of the way'we took, they come upon
us towards the dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched
our camp between two little, but very thick woods, with a
little river running before our front and some felled trees
with which we covered our rear ; a precaution we always
took, and which we had just finished.when the enemy
came up. They did not fall on us immediately, but sent
three messengers, demanding the men who had insulted
their priests, and burnt their god Cham Chi-Thaungu,,
that they might be burnt with fire-; that if this was com-
plied with, they would peaceably depart; but if not, they
would destroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one
another on receipt of this message, but Nobody was the-
word, as indeed nobody knew it, but he who did. it. Upom
which the leader of the caravan returned for answer, "that
they were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none
of their priests and gods; and therefore desired them no:
to disturb us, and put us to the necessity of defending our-
selves." But so far was this from satisfying them, that
the ne.xt morning coming to our right, they let fly a vol-
ley of arrows among us, which happily did not hurt any,,
because we sheltered ourselves behmd our baggage. We
expected'however to come to a closer engagement; but
were happily saved by a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who
obtaining leave of the leader to go out, mounts his horse,
rides directly from our rear, and taking a circuit, comes.
up to the Tartars, as though he had been sent express, and:
tells them a formal story, that th« wretches who had. but nt
the Cham Chi- 1'haunga, were gone to Shiheilka, wiih a

cilka, and in less than three minutes were out of sight,
nor did we ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held
us twen.tjr-three days march, infested with several small
companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had
the-courage to attack us. After-we had passed over this
desert we found several garrisons to defend the caravans
from the violence of the Tartars. In particular the Gov-
ernor of Adinskoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the
next station, if we apprehended any danger. The people
here retained the same paganism and barbarity, only they
were not so dangerous, being conquered by the Musco-
vites. The clothing, both of men and women, is of the
skins of beasts, living under the ground in vaults and caves,
which have a communication with one another. They
have idols almost in every family ; besides, they adore the
sun and stars, water and snow ; and the least uncommon
thing that happens in the elements, alarms them as much
as thunder and lightning does the unbelieving Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our mai'ch through this
country. When we had gone through the desert, after
two days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite
city, on the great river so called, which we were told part-
Europe and Asia. The inhabitants here, were very lit-
tle bettcr,thougb mtermixed with the Muscovites, but the
yonder will cease, when I inform my reader of what was
observed to me, that the Czar raiher-converts the Tartars
with soldiers than clergyman, and is more proud to make
them faithful subjects, than good Christians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over a
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want
of good management and people, and those few are mostly
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals
are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next
city we came to, was the capital city of Siberia, called To-,
bolski, when having been almost seven months on qur.
journey, and winter drawing on apace, my partner con-
sulted with me about our particular affairs, in what man-
ner we should dispose of ourselves. We had been told of
sledges and rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the win-
ter season,,the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges
can run upon the surface without any danger of going
flown. As I was bound to Englandi I now behoved cither
to go with the caravan to Jeroslaw, from thence west, to
Marva, and the Gulph of Finland, and so by land or sea to
Denmark; or else'! must leave the caravan at a little
town on the Dvrina, and so to Archangel, where I was
certain either of shipping to England, Holland, or-Ham-
burgh. One night I happened to get into the company of
an illustrious but banished Prince, whose company and
virtues were such as made me propose to him a method
how he might obtain his liberty. "My dear friend," said
he,l' as I am here happily free from my miserable great-
"ness, with all its attendants of pride, ambition, avarice
"and luxury,if I should escape fro'm this place, those per-
"nicious scedsmay again revive,to mylasungdisquietiule;
"therelore, let me remain in a blessed confinement, lor I
"am but flesh, a mere man, with passions and affections
"as such ; O be not my friend and tempter too !" Struck
dumb with surprise, I stood silent a while; nor was he
less in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to give
vent to his mind, I desired him to consider it, and so
withdrew. But about two hours after he came to my
apartment: "Dear friend," said he, "though I cannoe
"consent to accompany you, I shall have this satisfaction
*' in parting, that you leave me an honest man still; but
"as a testimony of my affection to you, be pleased (o ac-
"ctpt this present of sables." . . .
In return for his compliment, I sent my servant next
meriting to his Lordship, with a small present of tea, two
pieces of China (kniuisb, and four little wedges of gold;
but he only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, anu one
piece of gold for the curiosity of the Japan stanip that
•Was upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and hoped
that what he had refused himself, upon his account I
would grant to another, whom he should numc; in short
it was his only son, who was about nvo hundred miles dis-
tant from him, on the other side of the city, whom he
said he would send for if I gave my consent. This I soon
complied with; upon which lie sent his servants next day
for his son who returned in twenty days time brmging
seven horses, loaded with valuable furs. At night the
young Lord was conducted incognito iuto our apartment
where his father presented him to me. We then concert-
ed the best means for travelling, and after having bought
a considerable quantity of sables, black t'ox skins, fme er-
mines, &c. (which I sold at Archangel, at a good price)
we set out from this ciiy th< beginning of June, making a
small caravan, being about thirty-two horses anil camels
of which I represented the head. My young Lord had
with him a very faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted
with the roads We shunned the principal towns and ci-
ties, jsTumen, Soli-Kanioiski, and several others, by rea-
son of their strictness in examining travellers,'lest any of
the banished persons of distinction should escape. Having
passed the river Kama, we came to a city on the Euro-
pean side, called Soloy Kamoskoi, where we found the
people mostly Pagans, as before. We then passed a de-
sert of about twohundred miles over ; but in other places
it is near seven hundred. In passing this place, we were
beset by a troop of men on horseback, and about five and
forty men armed with bows andarrows. At first they look-
ed earnestly on us,and then placed themselves in our way.
We were above sixteen men, and drew up a little linebe-
four our camels. My young Lord sent out his Siberian
servant, to know who they were But when he approach-
ed them- he neither knew one word they said, nor would
they admit him t0 come near them at his peril, but pre-
pared to shoot him. At his return, he told us he believed
them to be Calmuck Tartars, and that there were more
upon the desert. This was but a small comfort to us '-
yet seeing a little gtove, about a quarter of a mile distant,
we moved to it, by the old Portuguese pilot's advice, with-
out meeting with any opposition. Here we found a mar*
shy piece of ground, and a spring of water running into
a little brook on one side, which joined another like it, a
little farther off, and these two formed the head of the riv-
er called Wfitska. As soon as we arrived, we went to
work, cutting great arms off the trees, and laying them
hanging (not quite off) from one tree to another. In this-
situation we waited the motion of the enemy, without per-
ceiving any advancement they made towards us. About
two hours before night, being joined by some others, in
all about fourscore horses, among whom we fancied were
some women, they came upon us with great fury We
fired without ball, calling to them in the Russian tongue,
to know their business: but they either not knowing, or
seeming not to understand us, came directly to the wood
side, not considering that we were so fortified, as that they
could not break in. Our old pilot the Portuguese, proved-
both our captain and. engineer, and^desired us not to fire*
till they came within pistol shot: and when he gave the
word of command, then to take the surest aim: but he bid
•us not to .fire lill they were within two pikes length of us,
and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded several, as
also their horses, having every one of us loaded our pie-
ces with two or three bullets at least. So much were they
surprised at our undauntedness, that they retired about
a hundred rods from us. In the meantime we loaded our
pieces again, and sallying out, secured four of their
horses, whose riders we found were killed, and perceived
them to be Tartars. About an hour after, they made
another attempt, to see where they might break in; but
finding us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in strengthening our
situation, and barricading the entrances into the woods;
but when day-light came, we had a very unwelcome dis-
covery; for the enemy, being encouragzd by their num-
bers, had set up eleven or f.velve tents, in iorm of a camp,
about three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I
•was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and
all that I had over for lost. And my partner declared,
that as the loss cf his goods would be his ruin, b=fore they
should be taken from him, he v?c-ald fight to the last drop
of his blood. As we could not pretend to force our way, we
had recourse to a stratagem: we kindled a large £pe,v/hich
burnt all night; and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued
our journey towardi, the pole, or north star, and travelling
all night; by six o'clock in the morning we came to a Rus-
sian village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a large
town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops
of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the desert, but
that we were past all danger. In five days after we came
to Veuslima, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we
came to Laurenskoy, on the third of July, where, provid-
ing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a convenient
bark, we embarked the seventh, and arrived at Archangel
the eighteenth, after a year, five months, and three days
journey, including the eight months and odd days at To-
bolski. We came from Archangel the 2Qth of August, in
the same year, and arrived at Hamburg the 30th of Sep-
tember. Here my partner and I made a very good sale
of our goods, both those of China and Siberia; when, di-
viding our effects, my share came to 34751. 17s. 3d. af-
ter all the losses we had sustained, and charges we had
been at. Ile.e the young Lord took his leave of me, in or-
der to go to the court of Vienna, not only to seek protec-
tion, but to correspond with his father's friends. After we
had staid four months in Hamburgh, I went from thence
overland to the Hague, were embarking in the packet, I
arrived in London the 10th of January. 1705, after ten
years and nine months absence from England.
