PRINTED IN m UNITED STATES OF MRICAin the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull: he got
a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived
afterward at York; from whence he had married my mother,
whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family
in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson
Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption of words in England,
we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name
Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of Foot in Flanders, formerly
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What he-

1THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES

came of my second brother I never knew, any more than my
father or mother lmew what became of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.
My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of .learning, as far as house education and a country
free school generally goes, and designed me for the law; but
I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my
inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,
the commands of my father, and against all the enteaties
and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there
seemed to be something fatal in that propension of nature
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex-
cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined by the gOut, and expostulated very warmly with me
upon this subject: he asked me what reasons, more than a
mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving my father's
house and my native country, where I might be well intro-

'duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by applica-
tion and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told
me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of
aspiring superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad
upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road;
that these things were all either too far above me, or too far
below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be

called the upper station of low life, which he had found by

2OF ROBINSON CRUSOE

long experience was the best state in the world, the most
suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and
hardships, the labour and suflerings of the mechanic part of
mankind, and notl embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambi-
tion, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I
might judge of the happiness of this state, by this one thing,
namely, that this was the state of life which all other people
envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable
consequences of being born to great things, and wish they had
been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the
mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony
to this, as the just standard of true felicity, when he prayed
to have neither poverty nor riches.

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower
partimanldndibut that the middle station had the fewest
disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as
the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not sub-
jected to so many distempers and uneasinesses either of body
or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and ex-
travagancies on one hand, or by hard labour, want of
necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand,
bring distempers upon themselves by the natural conse-
quences of their way of living; that the middle station of life
was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of enjoy-
ments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,
society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures,
were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that

 

3
this way men went silently and smoothly through the world,
and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours
of the hands or of the head, not sold to the life of slavery for
daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which
rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest; not enraged with
the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for
great things; but in easy circumstances sliding gently through
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living without
the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and learning by every
day's experience to know it more sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most afiec-
tionate manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate
myself into miseries which nature and the station of life I
was born in seemed to have provided against; that I was
under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do
well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station
of life which he had been just recommending to me; and that
if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my
mere fate or fault that must hinder it, and that he should
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty
, in warning me against measures which he knew would be
to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things
for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so
he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to
give me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he
told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young
desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was

4
killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for
me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure
hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when
there might be none to assist 1n my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse,--which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know
it to be so himself,--I say, I observed the tears run down his
face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my
brother who was killed; and that when he spoke of my having
leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved,
that he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart was so
full, he could say no more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as, indeed, who
could be otherwise, and I resolved not to think of going
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
father's desire. But, alas! a few days WQITGJIBH 91f,and,_in_
short, to prevent any of my fathers further importunities,in
a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as my first heat of
resolution prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when I
thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her
that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world,
that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough
to go through with it, and my father had better give me his
consent than force me to go without it; that I was now eight-
een years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade,

_ or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I should never
serve out my time, and I should certainly run away from my

5
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me go but one voyage abroad,
if I came home again and did not like it, I would go no more,
and I would promise by a double diligence to recover that
time I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion: she told me, she
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest
to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt, and
I that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after
such a diswurse as I had had from my father, and such kind
and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to
me, and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no
help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
consent to it; that for her part she would not have so much
hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say,
that my mother was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him,
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said
. to her, with a sigh, "That boy might be happy if he would
stayathome, but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miser-
able wretch that was ever born; I can give no consent to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively
determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually,

6
and without any purpose of making an elopement that time--
but I say, being there, and one of my companions being about
to sail to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to
go with them, with the common allurement of seafaring men,
namely, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as
sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they
might, fith'outasking God's blessing, or my father's, without
any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in
an ill Bohr--Cod knows.

 

 

{3:15; ,_ p N THE FIRST of September,

- ' 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London. Never any young adventurer's misfor-
tunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine.
The ship was no sooner gotten out of the Humber, but the
wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a most frightful
manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I was most
inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I began now

7
seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I
was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty; all the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind, and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it
has been since, reproached me with the contempt of advice,
and the breach of my duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I
had never been upon before, went very high, though nothing
like what I have seen many times since; no, nor like what I
saw a few days after: but it was enough to affect me then,
who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything
of the matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed
us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in
the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more;
and in this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions,
that if it would please God here to spare my life this one
voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again I
would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a
. ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice and
never run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now
I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the mid-
dle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived
all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea,
or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm continued, and indeed some time after; but the next

8
day the wind was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to
be a little inured to it: however, I was very grave for all that
day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming
fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and
rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a
smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought,
the most delightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that
was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so
calm and so pleasant in so little time after. And now, lest my
good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had
indeed enticed me away, comes to me. "Well, Bob," says he,
(clapping me upon the shoulder,) "how do you do after it?
I warrant you were frighted, wan't you, last night, when it
blew but a cap full of wind?" "A cap full do you call it?" said I.
"It was a terrible storm." "A storm, you fool you," replies he,
"do you call that a storm? why it was nothing at all; give us
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such
a squall of wind as that; but y0u're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob: come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget
all that. Do you see what charming weather it is now?" To
make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way of
all sailors; the punch was made, and I was made drunk with
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my re-
pentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, and all

. my resolutions for my future. In a word, as the sea was re-
turned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by

9
the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed
up by. the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that
I made in my distress. I found indeed some intervals of re-
flection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour
to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused
myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying
myself to drink and company, soon mastered the return of
those fits, for so I called them, and I had in five or six days
got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fel-
low that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But
I Was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in
such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse. For if I would not take this for a deliverance,
the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened
wretch among us would confess both the danger and the
mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth
Roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather
. calm, we had made but little way since the storm. Here we
were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind
continuing contrary, namely, at south-west, for seven or eight
days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle
came into the same roads, as the wmmon harbour where the
ships might wait for a wind for the river.

We had not, however, rid here so long, but should have
tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and
after we had lain four or five days blew very hard. However,

10
the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage
good, and our ground tackle very strong, our men were un-
concerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea;
but the eighth day in the morning, the wind increased, and
we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and make
everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy
as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our
ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought
once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our
master ordered out the sheet anchor, so that we rode with
two anchors a--head, and the cables veered out to the better
end.

By this time it blew a tenible storm indeed; and now I be-
gan to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the sea-
men themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business
of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin
by me, I could hear him softly to himself say several times,
Lord, be merciful to us; we shall be all lost, we shall be all un-
done, and the like. During these first hurries, I was stupid,-
lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot
describe my temper. I could ill reassume the first penitence
which I had so apparently" trampled upon, and hardened my-

Tthat this would be nothing like the first. But when the
master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted; I got up out of
my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never
saw: the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us every

11
three or four minutes: when I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us: two ships that rid near us, we
found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep loaden;
and our men cried out, that a ship which rid about a mile
a-head of us was foundered. Two more ships being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea at all
adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light
ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running
away with only their spritsail out before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the mas-
ter of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he
was very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to
him, that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented;
and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast
stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must he in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a
fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance
the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold
' more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions,
and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these,
added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition,
that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not
come yet: the storm continued with such fury, that the sea-
men themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse.
We had a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed

12
in the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried out
she would founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that
I did not know what they meant by founder, till I inquired.
However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what is not
ftenWaster, the boaiswain, and some others more
sensible than the rest at their prayers, and expecting every
moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle
of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of
the men that had been down on purpose to see, cried out, we
had sprung a leak; another said there was four foot water in
the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that
very word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell
backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the
cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me, that I who
was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as
another: at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master see-
ing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not
come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress.
I, who knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that
I thought the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing hap-
pened. In a word I was so surprised, that I fell down in a
swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life
to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me;
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead, and
it was a great while before I came to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it

13
was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the
storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into a port, so the master con-
tinued firing guns for help; and a light ship who had rid it
out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near
the ship's side; till at last, the men rowing very heartily, and
venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope
over the stem with the buoy to it, and then veered it out a
great length, which they, after great labour and hazard, took
hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern and got all
into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us after we
were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship, so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore
as much as we could, and our master promised them, that
if the boat was staved upon shore he would make it good
to their master; so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat
went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore al-
most as far as Winterton-Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of
- our ship before we saw her. sink, and then I understood for
the first time what was meant/by a ship foundering in the
sea. I must acknowledge I' had hardly eyes to look up when
the seamen told me she was sinking; for from that moment
they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to
go in: my heart was as it were dead within me, partly with
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what
was yet before me.

14
While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at
the oars to bring the boat near the shore, we wuld see (when
our boat mounting the waves we were able to see the shore)
a great many people running along the shore to assist us when
we should come near; but we made but slow way towards
the shore, nor were we able to reach the shore, till being
past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the
westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke all a little
the violence of the wind: here we got in, and, though not '
without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates
of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular
merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us
suficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as
we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem
of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted
calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast
away in Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had
any assurance that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls

from my reason and my more composed judgmentto g3 home;
yetfliad ngpewertq do it. I lcnow not what to call this, no}
will I {life that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries
us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even

though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our

15
eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoid-
able misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm rea-
sonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible instructions as I had met with in my
first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The
first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which
was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the
town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and looking very melancholy,
and shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his
father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a
trial, in order to go farther abroad; his father, turning to me
with a very grave and concerned tone, "Young man," says he,
"you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a
seafaring man." "Why, sir," said I, "will you go to sea no
more?" "That is another case," said he, "it is my calling, and
therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial,
' you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are
to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all befallen us on your
account, like Jonah, in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," continued
he, "what are you? and on what account did you go to sea?"
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which
he burst out with a strange kind of passion: "What had I
done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come
into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with

16
thee again for a thousand pounds." However, he afterwards
talked very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
father and not tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might
see a visible hand of Heaven against me. "And, young man,"
said he, "depend upon it if you do not go back, wherever
you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disap--

saw him no more; which way he went, I know not. As for me,
having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by
land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take, and whether
I should go home, or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
oifered to my thoughts, wimmediately occurred to me

\y--m

how I should he laughed at among the neighbours, and should

_be_ ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
everybody else; from whence I have since often observed,
how' incongruous and irrational the common temper of man--
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases, namely, that they are not ashamed
to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but
are ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be
esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of life to
lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and
as I stayed a while, the remembrance of the distress I had

17
been in wore OE, and as that abated, the little motion I had
in my desires to a return were off with it, till at last I quite
laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from my
father's house, that hurried me into the wild notion of raising
my fortune, and that imprest those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the en-
treaties and even the command of my father; I say, the same
influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortlmate of
all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel bound
to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a
v0yage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I
did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though I might in-
deed have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the
same time I had learned the duty and office of a fore-mast
man and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in
my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always
go on board in the habit of a gentleman, and so I neither had
any business in the ship, nor learned to do any.

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and un-
guided young fellows as I then was; the devil generally not
omitting to lay some snare for them very early: but it was not
so with me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having had
very good success there, was resolved to go again; and who,

18
taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all dis-
agreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see
the world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should
be at no expense; I should be his messmate and his companion,
and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all

the advantage of it that the trade would admit, and per-
haps I might meet with some encouragement.

I embraced the ofier, and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man,
I went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure
with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend
the captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about
401. in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to
buy. This 401. I had mustered together by the assistance of
some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I
believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute
so much as that to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful
in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain, under whom also I got a
competent knowledge of the mathematics, and the rules of
navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some
things that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for,
as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn, and,
in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for
my adventure, which yielded me in London at my return,

19
almost 3001., and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particu-
larly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent
fever by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal trad-
ing being upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees
north even to the line itself.

    

WAS now set up for a
Guinea trader; and my friend,
to my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I
resolved to go the same voyage again, and I embarked in
the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former
voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This was
the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did
not carry quite 1001. of my new gained wealth, so that I had
2001. left, and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who
was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this
voyage; and the first was this, namely: Our ship, making her

20
course towards the Canary Islands, or rather between those
islands and the African shore, was surprised in the grey of
the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase
to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as
much canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry,
to have got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen.
About three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bring-
ing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart
our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to
bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer 0E again, after returning our fire, and pouring
in also his small shot from near 200 men which he had on
board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men keep-
ing close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but laying us on board the next time upon our
other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging.
We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and
such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to
cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being
disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight wounded,
we were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I
apprehended, nor was I carried up the country to the em-
peror's court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept by
the captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made his

21
slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his business. At
this surprisingchange of my circumstances,_from amerghgt
39, a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I
looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me, which
I thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken
me, and I was undone without redemption. But, alas! this
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will
appear in the sequel of the story.

As my new patron or master had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes that he would take me with him
when he went to sea again, believing that it would some time
or other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese
man of war, and that then I should be set at liberty. But this
hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to sea,
he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he
came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it: nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to, that
would embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irish-
man, or Scotchman, there but myself; so that for two years,
though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I
never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in prac-
fice.

22
After about two years an odd circumstance presented it-
self, which put the old thought of making some attempt for
my liberty again in my head: my patron lying at home longer
than usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard,
was for want of money, he used constantly, once or twice a
week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the
ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing; and as he
always took me and a young Maresco with him to row the
boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous
in catching fish: insomuch, that sometimes he would send me
with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Maresco
as they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew
not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the
next night, and when the morning came we found we had
pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore, and that
we were at least two leagues from the shore; however, we got
well in again, though with a great deal of labour, and some
danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morn-
ing, but particularly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him
the long boat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved
he would not go a fishing any more without a compass and
some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who
also was an English slave, to build a little state-room or cabin
in the middle of the long boat, like that of a barge, with a

9-3
place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the main-sheet,
and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the
sails, She sailed with what we call a shoulder of mutton sail;
and the boom gibed over the top of the cabin, which lay
very snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with a
slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers
to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink,
particularly his bread, rice and coffee.

We went frequently out with this boat a fishing, and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went with-
out me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in this
boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors
of some distinction in that place, and for whom he had pro-
vided extraordinarily; and had therefore sent on board the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than ordinary,
and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder
and shot, which were on board his ship, for that they de-
signed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.

I got all things ready as he directed, and waited the next
morning with the boat washed clean, her flag and pendants
out, and everything to accommodate his guests; when by-and-
by my patron came on board alone, and told me his guests
had put off going, upon some business that fell out, and
ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to
sup at his house; and commanded that as soon as I got some
fish I should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared
to do. ' - '

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into

24
my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship
at my command; and my master being gone, I prepared to
furnish myself, not for a fishing business, but for a voyage;
though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither
I should steer; for anywhere to get out of that place was my
way.

My first oontrivance was to make a pretence to speak to
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for
I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread:
he said, that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh water into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which
it was evident by the make were taken out of some English
prize; and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor
was on shore, as if they had been there before for our master.
I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which ,
weighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine
or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of
great use to us afterwards; especially the wax to make can-
dles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently
came into also; his name was Ismael, who they called Muly,
or Moley; so I called to him, Moley, said I, our patron's guns
are on board the boat, can you not get a little powder and
shot, it may be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our
curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner's stores
in the ship? Yes, says he, I'll bring some; and accordingly
he brought a great leather pouch which held about a pound
and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with shot,
that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into

25
the boat; at the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the
large bottles in the case, which was almost empty; pouring
what was in it into another: and thus furnished with every-
thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle
which is at the entrance of the port knew who we were, and
took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the
port before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish;
the wind blew from the N.N.E. which was contrary to my
desire; for had it blown southerly I had been sure to have
made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of
Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I
would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave
the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for
- when I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that
he might not see them; I said to the Moor, this will not do,
our master will not be thus served, we must stand farther off:
he thinking no harm agreed, and being in the head of the
boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I would
fish, when giving the boy the helm, I stept forward to where
the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for something be-
hind him, I took him by surprise with my arm under his
legs, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose
immediately, for he swam like a cork, and calling to me,
begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world
with me; he swam so strong after the boat that he would have
reached me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon

26
which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the
fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had
done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him
none: but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the shore,
and the sea is calm, make the best of your way to shore, and I
will do you no harm, but if you come near the boat I'll shoot
you through the head; for I am resolved to have my liberty:
so he turned himself about and swam for the shore, and I
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an

excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to
trust him. When he was gone I turned to the boy, who they
called Xury, and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful
to me I'll make you a great man, but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me, that is swear by Mahomet and
his fathers' heard, I must throw you into the sea too: the boy
smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently that I could not
mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over
the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards the Straits
mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do), for who would have supposed
we were sailed on to the southward to the truly Barbarian
coast, where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround
us with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could never

27
once go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts,
or more merciless savages of human kind?

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth
quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day
at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land,
I could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite be-
yond the emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any
other Icing thereabouts, for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor. The
wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five
days, and the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded
also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also
would now give over; so I ventured to make the coast, and
came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not
what, or where; neither what latitude, what country, what
nation, or what river: I neither saw, or desired to see any
people, the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We
came into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but as soon
as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures of we knew
not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear,
and begged of me not to go on shore till day. Well, Xury,
said I, then I won't, but it may be we may see men by day,

28
who will be as bad to us as those lions. Then we give them
the shoot gun, says Xury, laughing; make them run way. Such
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. However
I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram
(out of our pan-on's case of bottles) to cheer him up: after
all Xury's advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our
little anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept
none; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures
(we lmew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down
to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing and wash-
ing themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and
they made such hideous howlings and yellings that I never
indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both more frighted when we heard one of these
mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat: we could
not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a
monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to
me to weigh the anchor and row away. No, says I, Xury, we
can slip our cable with a buoy to it and go oil to sea, they
cannot follow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I perceived
the creature (whatever it was) within two oars' length, which
something surprised me; however I immediately stept to the
cabin-door, and taking up my gun fired at him, upon which
he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore
again.

But it is impossible to describe the honible noises, and
hideous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well upon

29
the edge of the shore, as higher within the country, upon
the noise or report of the gun; a thing I have some reason to
believe those creatures had never heard before: this con-
vinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night upon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day
'was another question too; for to have fallen into the hands
of any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen
into the hands of lions and tigers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the
boat; when or where to get it was the point. Xury said, if I
would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would find
if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him why
he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the boat?
The boy answered with so much aEection that made me love
him ever after. Says he, If wild mans come, they eat me, you
go way. Well, Xury, said I, we will both go, and if the wild
mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us; so
I gave Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of
our patron's case of bottles which I mentioned before; and
we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and waded on shore; carrying nothing but our guns,
and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river: but the boy
seeing a low place about a mile up the country rambled to
it; and by and by I saw him come nmning towards me. I
thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with

30
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him,
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over
his sh0u1ders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a
hare, but different in colour, and longer legs; however we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the great
joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found
good water, and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains
for water; for a little higher up the creek where we were, we
faund the water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but
a little way up; so we filled our jars and feasted on the hare
we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no
foot-steps of any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very
well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
Islands also, lay not far OE from the coast. But as I had no in-
struments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactly know, or at least remember,
what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for them,
or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I might
now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope
was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part
where the English traded, I should find some of their vessels
upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take
us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was,
must be that country, which lying between the emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste, and unin-
habited, except by wild beasts, the Negroes having abandoned

31
it, and gone farther south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness;
and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious num--
ber of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which
harbour there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only,
where they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time; and indeed for near an hundred miles together upon
this coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country
by day; and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild
beasts by night.

Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Peak of
Teneriife, being the high top of the mountain Teneriffe in
the Canaries; and had a great mind to venture out in hopes
of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my
little vessel, so I resolved to pursue my first design and keep
along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we
had left this place; and once in particular, being early in the
morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of land
which was pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we
lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about
him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me
that we had best go farther off the shore; for, says he, look
yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast
asleep. I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful mon-
ster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side
of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung
as it were a little over him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore

32
and kill him: Xury looked frighted, and said, Me kill! he eat
me at one mouth; one mouthful he meant. However, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him lie still; and took our biggest
gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a
good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down;
then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third,
for we had three pieces, I loaded with five smaller bullets.
I took the best aim I could with the first piece, to have shot
him into the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little
above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and
broke the bone. He started up growling at first, but finding
his leg broke, fell down again, and then got up upon three
legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was
a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however,
I took up the second piece immediately, and though he be-
gan to move off, fired again, and shot him into the head, and
had the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise,
but lay struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would
have me let him go on shore. Well, go said I. So the boy
jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand,
swam to the shore with the other hand, and coming close to
the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot
him into the head again, which dispatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food and I
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon
a creature that was good for nothing to us However, Xury
said he would have some of him; so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. For what, Xury? said I.
Me cut off his head, said he. However, Xury could not cut

33
05 his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him,
and it was a monstrous great one.

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other be of some value to us; and I resolved
to take off his sldn, if I could. So Xury and I went to work
with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the
whole day; but at last we got the hide 01f him, and spreading
it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two
days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually
for ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our provisions,
which began to abate very much, and going no oftener into
the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water: my design
in this was, to make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to
say anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not
what course I had to take, but to seek for the Islands, or
perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships
from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to
Brasil, or to the East Indies, made this Cape, or those Islands;
and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single
point, either that I must meet with some ship or must perish.

' When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon the shore to look at us; we could also perceive they
were quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to
have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsel-

34
lor, and said to me, No go, no go: however I hauled in nearer
the share that I might talk to them, and I found they ran
along the shore by me a good way. I observed they had no
weapons in their hands except one, who had a long slender
stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they would
throw them a great way with good aim. So I kept at a distance, 1
but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and partic- '
ularly made signs for something to eat: they beckoned to
me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat;SS
upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two 1
of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour .
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh I
and some corn, as is the produce of their country; but we '
neither knew what the one nor the other was: however, we
were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next
dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for
us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and
went and stood a great way ofl till we fetched it on board,
and then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends; but an opportunity ofiered that very
instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying
by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the
other (as we took it) with great fury, from the mountains
towards the sea: whether it was the male pursuing the female,
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,
any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange,
but I believe it was the latter; because, in the first place, those

35
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and in
the second place, we found the people terribly frighted, es-
pecially the women. The man that had the lance or dart
did not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water, they did not seem to
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves
into the sea, and swam about as if they had come for their
diversion. At last one of them began to come nearer our boat
than at first I expected, but I lay ready for him, for I had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my
reach, I fired, and shot him directly into the head. Immedi-
ately he sunk down into the water but rose instantly, and
plunged up and down as if he was struggling for life; and so
indeed he was: he immediately made to the shore, but be-
tween the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the stran-
gling of the water, he died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun; some of them
were even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with
the very terror. But when they saw the creature dead, and
sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and began
to search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining
the water; and by the help of a rope, which I slung round
him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on
shore, and found that it was. a most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree, and the Negroes held up

36
their hands with admiration to think what it was I had killed
him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the
noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the
mountains from whence they came, nor could I at that dis-
tance know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have
them take it as a favour from me, which when I made signs
to them that they might take him, they were very thankful
for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and though they '
had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they took
off his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we could
have done with a knife: they oEered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made
signs for ' the skin, which they gave me very freely, and
brought me a great deal more of their provision, which though
I did not understand, yet I accepted; then I made signs to
them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them,
turning it bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, and
that I wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to
some of their friends, and there came two women, and brought
a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the
sun; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on
shore with my jars, and filled them all three.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was,
and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made for-
ward for about eleven days more, without offering to go near
the shore, till I saw the land nm out a great length into the
sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues before me;

37
and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large ofiing to make this
point: at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side to sea-ward;
then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this
was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands, called from
thence Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great
distance, and I could not tell what I had best do, for if I
should be taken with a fresh of wind I might neither reach
one nor the other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept into the
cabin and set me down, Xury having the helm, when on a
sudden the boy cried out, Master, master, a ship with a sail!
and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it
must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us,
when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not only the
ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they
were bound some other way, and did not design to come any
nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as much
as I could, resolving to speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but they would be gone by before I
could make any signal to them. But after I had crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some
European boat, which, as they supposed, must belong to some
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up.

38
I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's flag
on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress,
and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told-me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon
these signals they very kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me,
and in about three hours time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French; but I understood none of them; but at last
a Scottish sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I an-
swered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had
made my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then
they bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.

It was inexpressible joy to me, that any one would believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miser-
able and almost hopeless condition as I was in, and immedi-
ately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return
for my deliverance; but he generously told me, he would
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be delivered
safe to me when I came to the Brasils; for, says he, I have
saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be
saved myself; and it may one time or other be my lot to be
taken up in the same condition: Besides, says he, when I
carry you to the Brasils, so great a way from your own country,
if I should take away from you what you have, you will be
starved there, and then I only take away that life I have
given. No, no Seignor, Mr. Englishman, I will carry you
thither in charity, and those things will help you to buy your
subsistence there, and your passage home again.

m <<r' 'E HE WAS charitable in his

 

wt
proposal, so he was just in the

performance to a tittle, for he ordered the seamen, that
none should ofier to touch anything I had; then he took every-
thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact
inventory of them, that I might have them; even so much as
my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and
asked me what I would have for it? I told him, he had been
so generous to me in everything, that I could not oifer to make
any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me
80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil; and when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up; he
offered me also 60 pieces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was 10th to take; not that I was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very 10th to sell the poor boy's

4oliberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned
it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give
the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to
him, I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in

All-Saints-Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now '1
"(3.5.9333 more dflivered from the most miserable of all con-
ditions at life, and what to 7 do next withgmyself I was now to
cohsflider;
"The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember; he would take nothing of me for my pas-
sage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty
for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused every-
thing I had in the ship to be punctually delivered me; and
what I was willing to sell he bought, such as the case of
bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax,
for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about
220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went
on shore in the Brasils.

I had not been long here, but being recommended to the
house of a good honest man like himself, who had an Ingenio
as they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar house; I lived
with him some time, and acquainted myself by that means
with the manner of their planting and making of sugar; and
seeing how well the planters lived, and how they grew rich
suddenly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there, I
would turn planter among them, resolving in the meantime

41
to find out some way to get my money, which I had left in
London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a lu'nd of a
letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was
uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for
my plantation and settlement, and such a one as might-be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him neighbour, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably
together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather
planted for food, than anything else, for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began to come
into order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco,
and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for plant-
ing canes in the year to come; but we both wanted help; and
now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my boy Xury.

But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no
great wonder: I had no remedy but to go on; I was gotten
into an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly
contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook
my father's house, and broke through all his good advice;
nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or upper
degree of low life, which my father advised me to before; and
which if I resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at
home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as I had
done: and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this

42
as well in England among my friends, as have gone five thou-
sand miles ofI to do it, among strangers and savages in a
wilderness, and at such distance as never to hear from any
part of the world that had the least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour: no work to be done, but by the labour
of my hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been, and how should all men
reflect, that, when they compare their present conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity, by their
experience; I say how just has it been, that the truly solitary
life I reflected on in an island of mere desolation should be my
lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which, had I continued, I had in all probability
been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying
on the plantation, before my kind friend the captain of the
ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained
there, providing his loading, and preparing for his voyage,
near three months; when, telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and
sincere advice: Seignor Inglese, says he (for so he always
called me), if you will give me letters, and a procuration here
in form to me, with orders to the person who has your money
in London, to send your eflects to Lisbon, to such persons as
I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this coun-

43
try, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my
return; butsince human aEairs are all subject to changes and
disasters, I would have you give orders but for one hundred
pounds sterling, which you say is half your stock, and let
the hazard be run for the first; so that if it come safe, you may
order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you may have
the other half to have recourse to it for your supply.

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that

. I could not but be convinced it was the best course I could
take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom I had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain, as he desired.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all
my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with
the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour,
and what condition I was now in, with all other necessary
directions for my supply; and when this honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story, to a merchant at London, who represented it ef-

. fectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the money,
but out of her own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity to me.

. The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in
English goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them

' directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me

to the Brasils; among which, without my directions (for I

was too young in my business to think of them), he had taken
care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils neces-

44
sary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I
was surprised with joy of it; and my good steward the captain
had laid out the five pounds which my friend had sent him
for a present for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a
servant under bond for six years service, and would not accept
of any consideration, except a little tobacw, which I would
have him accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all; but my goods being all English manu-
factures, such as cloth, stufis, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell
them to a very great advantage, so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now
infinitely beyond my poor neighbo'uzg mean ' "the advance-
ment of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me
a Negro slave, and an European servant also; I mean an-
other besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our greatest adversity, so it was with me. 'I went on the
next year with great success in my plantation; I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neigthurs; and these
fifty rolls, being each of above an hundredweight, were well
cured and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon.
And now, increasing in business and in wealth, my head he-
gan to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach;
such as are indeed often the ruin of the best heads in business.

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room
for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my

45
father so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life, and of
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life
to be full; but other things attended me, and I was still to be
the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly to
increase my fault, and d0uble the reflections upon myself,
which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make. All
these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate
adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and
pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the clearest views
of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those
prospects and those measures of life, which nature and Provi-
dence concurred to present me with, and to make my' duty.

As I had done thus in breaking away from my parents, so
I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the
happy view I had of being a rich and thriving man in my
new plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire
of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted; and
thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulph of human
misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent
with life and a state of health in the world.

To come then by the just degrees to the particulars of this
part of my story; you may suppose, that having now lived
almost four years in the Brasils, and beginning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted acquaintance and friend-

'ship among my fellow planters, as well as among the mer-
chants at St. Salvadore, which was our port; and that in my
discourses among them I had frequently given them an ac-
count of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner

46
of trading with the Negoes there, and how easy it was to
purchase upon the coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives,
scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold dust,
Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but Negroes for the serv-
ice of the Brasils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying Negroes, which was a trade at that time not only not
far entered into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by
the Assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,
and engrossed in the public, so that few Negroes were bought,
and those excessively dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talldng of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and
told me they had been musing very much upon what I had
disooursed with them of the last night, and they came to make
a secret proposal to me; and after enjoining me to secrecy, they
told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea;
that they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened
for nothing so much as servants; that as this was a trade that
could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell
the Negroes when they came home; so they desired to make
but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and in a word,
the question was, whether I would go as their supercargo
in the ship, .to manage the trading part upon the coast of
Guinea; and they ofiered me that I should have my equal
share of the Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.

47
This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and planta-
tion of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of
becoming very considerable, and with a good stock upon it.
But for me, that was thus entered and established, and had
nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four
years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds
from England, and who in that time, and with that little addi-
tion, could scarce have failed of being worth three or four
thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too; for me to
think of such a voyage, was the most preposterous thing that
ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the oifer, than I could restrain my first rambling
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In
a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I mis-
carried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings
or covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of
my plantation and effects, in case of my death, making the
captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my
universal heir; but obliging him to dispose of my eifects as I
had directed in my will, one half of the produce being to
himself, and the other to be shipped to England.

' In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects,
and keep up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence
to have looked into my own interest, and have made a judg-
ment of what I ought to have done and not to have done, I

48
had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an under-
taking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its
common hazards; to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect
particular misfortimes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy rather than my reason; and accordingly, the ship
being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done
as by agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on
board in an evil hour, the lst of September--being the same
day eight years that I went from my father and mother at
Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool
to my own interest.

Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried 6 guns, and
14 men, besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had on
board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit
for our trade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass,
shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking-- glasses, knives,
scissors, hatchets, and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to
the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch
over for the African coast when they came about ten or twelve
degrees of northern latitude, which it seems was the manner
of their course in those days. We had very good weather, only
excessive hot, all the way upon our own coast till we came
the height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping far-
ther olf at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we
were bound for the isle Fernand de Noronha, holding our
course N.E. by N. and leaving those isles on the east. In this

49
course we passed the line in about twelve days' time, and
were by our last observation in seven degrees twenty-two
minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado or hurri-
cane took us quite out of our knowledge. It began from the
south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing
but drive, and scudding away before it, let it carry us whither
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve days I need not say that I expected every day
to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any in the ship expect to
save their lives.

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men died of fever, and one man and the boy washed
overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a
little, the master made an observation as well as he could,
and found he was in about eleven degrees north latitude,
but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude difference

west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was gotten
upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brasil, beyond
the river Amazones, toward that of the river Oronoque, com-
monly called the Great River, and began to consult with me
what course he should take, for the ship was leaky and very
. much disabled, and he was going directly back to the coast
of Brasil.

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there
was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we

50
came within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and therefore
resolved to stand away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off
at sea, to avoid the indraught of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days'
sail; whereas, we could not possibly make our voyage to the
coast of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and
to ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away
N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise deter-
mined; for being in the lafitude of twelve degrees eighteen
minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us
away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so
out of the very way of all human commerce, that had all our
lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own
country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of
our men early in the morning cried out, Land! and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immedi-
ately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very
foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in. the like
condition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men
in such circumstances. We knew nothing where we were, or

51
upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island or
the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds,
by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a
word, we sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly as prepar-
ing for another world, for there was little or nothing more for
us to do in this. That which was our present comfort, and all
the comfort we had, was, that contrary to our expectation
the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind
began to abate.

Now, though we found that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking
too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful
condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving
our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern
just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea, so there was
no hope from her. We had another boat on board, but how
to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing; however,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship would
.break in pieces every minute, and some told us she was ac-
tually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her slung
over the ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and com-

52
mitted ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy
and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated consider-
ably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and
might well be called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea
in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live,
and that we shOuld be inevitably drowned. As to making sail,
we had none, nor, if we had, could we have done anything
with it, so we worked at the oar towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all
knew, that when the boat came nearer the shore, she would be
dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. How-
ever, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest
manner, and the wind driving us towards the shore, we has-
tened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well
as we could towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep
or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation was, if we might hap-
pen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where
by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer
and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the
sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came
rolling a-stern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup--de-

53
grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset
the boat at once; and separating us, as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, 0 God!
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well,
yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw
breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me,
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself,
went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of
mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main
land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured
to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before another
wave should return and take me up again. But I soon found it
was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as
high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had
no means or strength to contend with. My business was to
hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could;
and so by swimming to preserve my breathing, and pilot my-
self towards the shore, if possible. My greatest concern now
being that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back towards the sea.

_ The wave that came upon me again buried me at once 20
or 30 feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself car-
ried with a mighty force and svviftness towards the shore, a
very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to
swim still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst

54
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so,
to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot
out above the surface of the water; and though it was not
two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved
me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was covered
again with water a good while, but not so long but I held it
out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and
felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few moments
to recover breath, and till the water went from me, and then
took to my heels and ran with what strength I had farther
towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the
fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, and
twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards
as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me;
for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with
such force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to
my own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it
not returned again immediately, I must have been strangled
in the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water,
I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so hold my
breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves
were not so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold
till the wave abated, and then fetched another nm, which
brought me so near the shore that the next wave, though it

55
went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me
away; and the next run I took I got to the main land, where,
to my great comfort, I clambered up the clefts of the shore,
and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved in a case wherein there
was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe
it is impossible to express to the life what the ecstasies and
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say,
out of the very grave. I walked about on the shore, lifting
up my hands, and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up
in the contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe, reflecting upon
all my comrades that were drowned, and that there should
not he one soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw
them afterwards, or any sign of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far
of, and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on
shore!

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
my condition, I began to look around me, to see what kind of

.place I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon
found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful
deliverance. For I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor
anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I
see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with hunger,

56
or being devoured by wild beasts; and that which was particu-
larly afflicting to me, was, that I had no weapon either to hunt
and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself
against any other creature that might desire to kill me
for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife
and a little tobacco in a box; this was all my provision, and
this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a
while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon
me, I began with a heavy heart to consider what would
be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country,
seeing at night they always come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time
was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night,
and consider the next day what death I should die, for as
yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,
which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a
little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the
tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so
as that if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cut me a
short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my
lodging, and having been excessively fatigued I fell fast asleep,
and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed with
it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.

57HEN I WAKED it was broad
day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as
before; but that which surprised me most was, that the ship
was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay by
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as
the rock which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the dashing me against it. This being within about a mile
from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upright still, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I might
save some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat,
which lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her, up upon
the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far
as I could upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck
or inlet of water between me and the boat, which was about
half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more

58intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find some-
thing for my present subsistence.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a" mile
of the ship, and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief;
for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had
been all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on shore,
and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute
of all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears
from my eyes again, but as there was little relief in that, I
resolved, if possible, to get to the ship, so I pulled off my
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the
water; but when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still
greater to know how to get on board, for as she lay a-ground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach
to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second time
. I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see
at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low as that with
great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope
got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold,
but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or
rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and
her head low almost to the water. By this means all her quar-
ter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you
may be sure my first work was to search and to see what was
_ spoiled and what was free; and first I found that all the ship's
provisions were dry and untouched by the water; and being
very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled

59
my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went about other
things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in
the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had
indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was before me.
Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with
many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be
had, and this extremity roused my application. We had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a
spare top-mast or two in the ship. I resolved to fall to work
with these, and flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope that
they might not drive away; when this was done I went down
the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them
fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of a
raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them
cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that
it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too
light; so I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut
a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my
raft, with a great deal of labour and pains: but hope of fur-
nishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go be-
yond what I should have been able to have done upon another
occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight; my next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I
was not long considering this. I first laid all the planks or
boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well

60
what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them
down upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provisions,
namely, bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little remainder
of European corn which had been laid by for some fowls
which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed.
There had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my
great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases
of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial
waters, and in all about five or six gallons of rack; these I
stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into
the chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I
found the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which
I had left on shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my
breeches, which were only linen and open-kneed, I swam on
board in them and my stockings. However, this put me upon
rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took
no more than I wanted for present use; for I had other things
which my eye was more upon--as, first, tools to work with on
shore; and it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to
me, and much more valuable than a ship-loading of gold
would have been at that time. I got it down to my raft, even
whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew
in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There

61
were two very good fowling--pieces in the great cabin, and
two pistols; these I secured first, with some powder-horns,
and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew
there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I
found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken
water. Those two I got to my raft, with the arms; and now I
thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how
I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor
rudder, and the least cap-full of wind would have overset all
my navigation.

I had three encouragements: a smooth, calm sea, the tide
rising and setting into the shore, and what little wind there
was blew me towards the land; and thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the
tools which were-in the chest, I found two saws, an axe and
a hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or
thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive
a little distant from the place where I had landed before, by
which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water,
and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there,
which I might make use of as a port to get to land with my
cargo.

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide
set into it, so I guided my raft as well as I could to keep in
the middle of the stream; but here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft

62
run a--ground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being
a-ground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my
cargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and
so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could
not thrust 0E the raft with all my strength, neither durst I
stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in that manner near half an hour, in
which time the rising of the water brought me a little more
upon a level; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft
floated again, and I thrust her off with the car I had into the
channel; and then driving up higher, I at length found myself
in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a
strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for
a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be
driven too high up the river, hoping in time to see some ship
at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the
coast as I could. .

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my
raft, and at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with
my oar, I could thrust her directly in. But here I had liked to
have dipped all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore
lying pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no place
to land, but where one end of the float, if it run on shore,
would lie so high, and the other sink lower as before, that
it would endanger my cargo again. All that I could do, was
to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with
my oar like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore,

63
near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would
flow over; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough
(for my raft drew about a foot of water), I thrust her on
upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored
her by sticking my two broken oars into the ground; one on
one side near one end, and one on the other side near the
other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and
left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure
them from whatever might happen. Where I was I yet knew
not; whether on the continent or on an island, whether in-
habited or not inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts
or not. There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose
up very steep and high, and which seemed to over-top some
other hills which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took
out one of the fowling--pieces, and one of the pistols, and an
horn of powder, and thus armed, I travelled for discovery
up to the top of that hill; where, after I had with great labour
and difliculty got to the top, I saw my fate to my great afllic-
tion, namely, that I was in an island environed every way
with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks which
lay a great way off, and two small islands less than this, which
lay about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, of whom however I saw none; yet I saw abundance of
fowls, but knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them
could I tell what was fit for food,' and what not. At my coming

64
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree
on the side of a great wood--I believe it was the first gun
that had been fired there since the creation of the world. I
had no sooner fired, but from all parts of the wood there arose
an innumerable number of fowls of many sorts, making a con-
fused screaming, and crying every one according to his usual
note; but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for
the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk, its colour
and beak resembling it, but had no talons or claws more than
common; its flesh was carrion and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up
the rest of that day; and what to do with myself at night I
knew not, nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really
no need for those fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made
a kind of a hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet
saw not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen
two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where
I shot the bird.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship which would be useful to me, and
particularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other
things as might come to land, and I resolved to make another
voyage to board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that
the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in

65
pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I got every-
thing out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a council,
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back
the raft; but this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go
as before, when the tide was down, and I did so, only that
I stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing on but
a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen trousers, and a pair
of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared a second
raft, and having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me; as first, in the carpen-
ter's stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes,
a great screw jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I
seemed, together with several things belonging to the gunner,
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of mus-
ket-bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with
some small quantity of powder more, a large bag full of small
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy
I wuld not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I
could find, and a spare fore-top-sail, hammock, and some hed-
ding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought
them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions during my absence from
the land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on
shore; but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor,
only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the

66
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little dis-
tance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and un-
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at
it, nor did she ofier to stir away; upon which I tossed her a
bit of biscuit, though by the way I was not very free of it,
for my store was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I
say, and she went to it, smelled it, ate it, and looked, as
pleased, for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain .
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels
(for they were too heavy, being large casks), I went to work
to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles which
I cut for that purpose; and into this tent I brought everything
that I knew would spoil, either with rain or sun, and I piled
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,
to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or
beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on-end
without; and spreading one of the beds on the ground, laying
my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me,
I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all
night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night before
I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as well
to fetch all those things from the ship as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever were

67
laid up, I believe, for one man, but I was not satisfied still;
for while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I
ought to get everything out of her that I could: so every day
at low water I went on board, and brought away something
or other; but particularly the third time I went, I brought
away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas,
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel
of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails
first and last, only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and
bring as much at a time as I could; for they were no more
useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still, was that, last of all,
after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought
I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth
my meddling with; I say, after all this, I found a great hogs-
head of bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and
a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour. This was surprising
to me, because I had given over expecting any more provi-
sions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by
parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word,
I got all this safe on shore also.

The next day I made another voyage; and now, having
plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out,
I began with the cables; and cutting the great cable into
pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser
on shore, with all the iron-work I could get; and having cut
down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything

68
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy
goods and came away. But my good luck began now to leave
me; for this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen, that after
I had entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of
my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water.
As for myself it was no great harm, for I was near the shore;
but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially the
iron, which I expected w0uld have been of great use to me.
However, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of
cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour;
for I was fain to dip for it into the water--a work which
fatigued me very much. After this, I went every day on board
and brought away what I could get.

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship, in which time I had brought
away all that one pair of hands could be well supposed ca-
pable to bring; though I believe verily, had the calm weather
held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by
piece. But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found
the wind begin to rise; however, at low water I went on board,
and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effec-
tually, as that nothing more could be found, yet I discovered
a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or
three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or
a dozen of good knives and forks; in another I faund about
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin, some
Brasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "0 Drug!"

69
said I, aloud, "what art thou good for? thou art not worth to
me, no, not the taldng off the ground. One of these knives is
worth all this heap. I have no manner of use for thee, even
remain where thou art and go to the bottom, as a creature
whose life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvas, I' began to think of making another raft; but while
I was preparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the wind
began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh
gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was
in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore,
and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of
flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore
at all: accordingly I let myself down into the water, and
swam across the channel, which lay between the ship and
the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with
the weight of things I had about me, and partly the rough-
ness of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before
it was quite high water it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with
all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all
that night; and in the morning when I looked out, behold no
more ship was to be seen. I was a little surprised, but re-
covered myself with this satisfactory reflection; namely, that
I had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything
out of her that could be useful to me; and that indeed there
was little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had
more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any

70
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her
wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those
things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages (if any should appear) or wild
beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling
to make; whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a
tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both, of
the manner, and description of which it may not be improper
to give an account.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near
the sea, and I believed would not be wholesome, and more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it, so I
resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground.

I consulted several things in my situation which I found
would be proper for me. Health, and fresh water, I just now
mentioned; shelter from the heat of the sun; security from
ravenous creatures, whether man or beast; a view to the sea,
that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose any ad-
vantage for my deliverance, of which I was not willing to
banish all my expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain
on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little
plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come
down upon me from the top; on the side of this rock there was
a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door

71
of a cave: but there was not really any cave or way into the
rock at all. ,

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above an hun-
dred yards broad, and aboutltwice as long, and lay like a
green before my door, and at the end it descended irregularly
'every way down into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was
on the N.N.W. side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or
thereahouts, which in those countries is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-di-
ameter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from
its beginning and ending.

In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driv-
ing them into the ground till they stood very firm, like piles,
the biggest end being out of the ground about five foot and a
half, and sharpened on the top; the two rows did not stand
above six inches from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the
ship, and laid them in rows one upon another, within the
circle between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, plac-
ing other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about
two foot and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence
was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it
or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, es-
pecially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the
place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door,

72
but by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when
I was in, I lifted over after me: and so I was completely
fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I
could not have done; though, as it appeared afterward, there
was no need of all this caution from the enemies that I ap-
prehended danger from.

  

;_NTO THIS FENCE or for-
- ' tress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition and
stores, of which you have the account above; and I made me
a large tent, which, to preserve me from the rains, that in one
part of the year are very violent there, I made double, namely,
one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it, and
covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin which I had
saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a
very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

 

73
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my
goods I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock; and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the
nature of a terrace, that so it raised the ground within about
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these
things were brought to perfection, and therefore I must go
back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts.
At the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme
for the setting up my tent and making the cave, that a storm
of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of
lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder,
as is naturally the effect of it. I.was not so much surprised
with the lightning, as I was with a thought which darted
into .my mind as swift as the lightning itself: 0 my powderl
my very heart sunk within me, when I thought, that at one
blast all my powder might be destroyed; on which, not my
defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, en-
tirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my
own danger, though, had the powder took fire, I had never
known who had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over I laid aside all my works, my building, and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes to sep-

74
arate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel,
in hope, that whatever might come, it might not all take fire at
once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to
make one part fire another. I finished this work in about a
fortnight; and I think, my powder, which in all was about
240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred
parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not appre-
hend any danger from that, so I placed it in my new cave,
which in my fancy I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid
up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might
come to it, marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out
once at least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself
as to see if I wuld kill anything fit for food, and, as near as
I could, to acquaint myself with what the island produced.
The first time I went out I presently discovered that there
were goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to
me; but then it was attended with this misforttme to me,
namely, that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of
foot, that it was the most dificult thing in the world to come
at them. But I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but
I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened; for
after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this
manner for them: I observed, if they saw me in the valleys,
though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as in
a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and
I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me: from whence
I concluded, that by the position of their optics, their sight
was so directed downward, that they did not readily see ob-

75
jects that were above them; so afterward I took this method:
I always climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then
had frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made among these
creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock-still by her till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure, upon which I laid dawn the dam, and took the
kid in my arms and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have
bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill
it and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great
while, for I eat sparingly, and saved my provisions (my
bread especially) as much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely nec-
essary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn;
and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave,
and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full account
of in its place; but I must first give some little account of
myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it may well
be supposed were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said,
by a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended
voyage, and a great way, some hundreds of leagues, out of
the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great rea-
son to consider it as a determination of Heaven that in this
desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my
life. The tears would run plentifufly down my face when I

76
made these reflections, and sometimes I would expostulate
with myself, why Providence should thus completely ruin his
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so with-
out help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts and to reprove me; and particularly one day,
walking with my gun in my hand by the sea-side, I was very
pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when rea-
son as it were expostulated with me the other way, thus:
Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but pray
remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat? Where are the ten? Why were
they not saved and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is
it better to be here or there? and then I pointed to the sea.
All evils are to be considered with the good that is in them,
and with what worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished
for my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it
had not happened, which was a hundred thousand to one,
that the ship floated from the place where she first struck,
and was driven so near the shore that I had time to get all
these things out of her? What would have been my case if I
had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first came
on shore, without necessaries of life or necessaries to supply
and procure them? Particularly, said I aloud (though to
myself), what should I have done without a gun, without
ammunition, without any tools to make anything, or to work
with; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of cover-

77ing? And that now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner, as to
live without my gun when my ammunition was spent, so that
I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as
long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I
should provide for the accidents that might happen and for
the time that was to come, even not only after my ammuni-
tion should be spent, but even after my health or strength
should decay.

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammuni-
tion being destroyed at one blast, I mean, my powder being
blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so
surprising to me when it lightened and thundered, as I ob-
served just now.

And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of
in the world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and
continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of
September, when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot
upon this horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head; for I reck-
oned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude of 9 de-
grees and 22 minutes north of the line.m .1; TTEIm

w" about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of
time for want of books, and pen and ink, and should even
forget the Sjbhathdays from the working days; but to prevent
this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post in capital letters,
and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where
I first landed, namely, ngwjom or
SEPT. 1659. Upon the sides of this square post I out every
day a notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as
long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as
long again as that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next place we are to observe, that among the many
things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages,
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things
of less value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted

setting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper;

 

79
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpen-
ter's keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical
instruments, dials, perspective glasses, charts, and books of
navigation; all which I huddled together, whether I might
want them or no; also, I found three very good Bibles which
came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had
packed up among my things; some Portuguese books also,
and among them two or three popish prayer-books, and sev-
eral other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not
forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose
eminent history I may have occasion to say something in its
place; for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the
dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore
to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and
was a trusty servant to me many years. I wanted nothing
that he could fetch me, or any company that he could make
up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he
could not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and
paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show,
that while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but after
that was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink, by
any means that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these
this of ink was one, as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig
or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I
soon learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and
it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my

80
little pale or surrounded habitation. The piles or stakes, which
were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and
bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in driving
it into the ground; for which purpose I got a heavy piece of
wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows, which, however, though I found it, yet it made driving
those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work.

But what need I have been concerned at the tediousness
of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in,
nor had I any other employment if that had been over, at
least, that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to
seek for food, which I did more or less every day.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of
posts and cables, but I might now rather call it a wall, for I
raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet
thick on the outside, and after some time, I think it was a
year and a half, I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock,
and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such
things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at
some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me;
but I must observe too, that at first this was a confused heap
of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all
my place, I had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to
enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth; for it was

81
a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I be-
stowed on it. And so when I found I was pretty safe as to
beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the
rock; and then turning to the right again, worked quite out,
and made me a door to come out, on the outside of my pale
or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a
backway to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room
to stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, as particularly a chair and
a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few
comforts I had in the world. I could not write or eat, or do
several things with so much pleasure without a table.

So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so
by stating and squaring everything by reason, and by making
the most rational judgment of things, every man may be in
tiffie master of every mechanic art. I had never handled a
tool in my life, and yet in time by labour, application, and
contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made
abundance of things, even without tools, and some with no
more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labour;
for example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it on a hedge before me, and hew it flat on
either side with my axe, till I had brought it to he as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by

82
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree,
but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which itth
me up to make a plank or board; but my time or labour was
little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as an-
other.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces
of boards which I brought on my raft from the ship; but when
I had wrought out some boards, as above, I made large shelves,
of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all
along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-
work, and in a word, to separate everything at large in their
places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked pieces
into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that
would hang up.

So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a gen-
eral magazine of all necessary things; and I had everything
so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock
of all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for indeed at first I was in too much hurry,
and not only hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure
of mind, and my journal would have been full of many dull
things.

I shall here give you the copy (though in it will be told
many particulars over again) as long as it lasted; for having
no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.

83
THE JOURNAL

SEPT. 30, 1659. I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being
shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the ofing, came on
shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I called the
Island of Despair, all the rest of the ship's company being

drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself, at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, namely, I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to, and in de-
spair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me, either
that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by sav-
ages, or starved to death for want of food. At the approach
of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept
soundly though it rained all night.

ocronr-za 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the
ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore
again much nearer the island, which as it was some comfort
on one hand, for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to
pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some food or necessaries out of her for my relief; so,
on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my com-
rades, who I imagined if we had all stayed on board might
have saved the ship, or at least that they w0uld not have
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been
saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the
ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other part of the
world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on
these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went

84
upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board:
this day also it continued raining, though with no wind at
all.

From the 1st of ocronnn to the 24th. All these days entirely
spent in making several voyages to get all I could out of the
ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon
rafts. Much rain also in these days, though with some intervals
of fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.

ocr. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon
it; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly
heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was out.

ocr. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of
wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be
seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I had
saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

001'. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find
out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure
myself from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts
or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place under a
rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment, which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification
made of double piles, lined within with cables, and without
with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
fime it rained exceeding hard.

The 3lst, in the morning, I went out into the island with my

85
gun, to see for some food, and discover the country, when I
killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home; which I
afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.

NOVEMBER 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there
for the first night, making it as large as I could with stakes
driven in to swing my hammock upon.

NOV. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces
of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a
fence round me, a little within the place I had marked out
for my fortification.

NOV. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to
work to make me a table.

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion.
Every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three
hours, if it did not rain, then employed myself to work till
about eleven o'clock, then eat what I had to live on, and
from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessive hot, and then in the evening to work again. The
worldng part of this day, and of the next, were wholly em-
ployed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry
workman, thOugh time and necessity made me a complete
natural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any
one else. ,

NOV. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog,
and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good
for nothing: every creature I killed I took off the skins and
preserved them. Coming back by the sea-shore I saw many

86
sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was sur-
prised and almost frighted with two or three seals, which,
while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got
into the sea, and escaped me for that time.

NOV. 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor
- was it long before I learned to mend it.

NOV. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday)
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and
even in the making I pulled it in pieces several times. norm.--
Wflg for omitting my mark

or them on my post, I forgot which was which.

NOV. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceed-
ingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me dreadfufly
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little
square chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or
two pounds at most, of powder; and so putting the powder
in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from one an-
other as possible. On one of these three days I killed a large
bird that was good to eat, but I know not what to call it.

NOV. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the
rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. NOTE. Three
things I wanted exceedingly for this work, namely, a pick-axe,

87
a shovel, and a wheel-barrow or basket, so I desisted from
my work, and began to consider how to supply that want,
and make me some tools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of
the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy; but
the next thing was a shovel or spade. This was so absolutely
necessary, that indeed I could do nothing efiectually without
it; but what kind of one to make I lcnew not.

NOV. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a
tree of that wood, or like it, which in the Brasils they call the
Iron Tree, for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great labour
and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece and brought it home
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other
way, made me a long while upon this machine; for I worked
it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or
spade, the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only
that the broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it
would not last me so long; however, it served well enough for
the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never was a
shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long a making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-barrow.
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such

.things as twigs that w0uld bend to make wicker ware, at least
none yet found out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I
could make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no
possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or
axis of the wheel to run in, so; I gave it over; and so for
carrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made

88
me a thing like a had which the labourers carry mortar in,
when they serve the bricklayers.

This was not so dificult to me as the making the shovel; and
yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in
vain to make a wheel-barrow, took me up no less than four
days, I mean always excepting my morning walk with my
gun, which I seldom failed; and very seldom failed also bring-
ing home something to eat.

NOV. 23. My other work having now stood still, because of
my making these tools, when they were finished I went on,
and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I
spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.

Norm. During all this time, I worked to make this room or
cave spacious enough to accommodate me a warehouse or
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar; as for my
lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet
season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep my-
self dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves
of trees like a thatch.

DECEMBER 10. I began now to think my cave or vault fin-
ished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large)
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one
side, so much, that in short it frighted me, and not without
reason too; for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a
grave-digger. Upon this disaster I had a great deal of work
to do over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out, and,

89
which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up,
so that I might be sure no more would come down.

DEC. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two
pieces of boards across over each post; this I finished the
next day, and setting more posts up with boards, in about
a week more I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing
in rows, served me for partitions to part 0E my house.

DEC. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts to hang everything up
that could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order
within doors.

one. 20. Now I carried everything into the cave, and began
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be
very scarce with me; also, I made me another table.

DEC. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.

one. 25. Rainallday.

DEC. 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter.

DEC. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I
caught it, and led it home in a string; when I had it home,
I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke. N.B.
I took such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well
and as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it grew tame,
and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not
go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food
when my powder and shot was all spent.

90
DEC. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze, so that there
was no stirring abroad, except in the evening for food; this
time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.

JANUARY 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther into the valleys, which lay towards
the centre of the island, I found there was plenty of goats,
though exceeding shy and hard to come at; however, I re-
solved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.

JAN. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my
dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for
they all faced about upon the dog; and he knew his danger
too well, for he would not come near them.

JAN. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.

-N.B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the Journal. It is sufficient to observe, that
I was no less time than from the 3d of JANUARY to the 14th of
APRIL, working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it
was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being
a half circle from one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it; the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I
should never be perfectly secure until this wall was finished;
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,

91
and driving them into the ground, for I made them much
bigger than I need to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fence
with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that
if any people were to come on shore there, they would not
perceive anything like a habitation; and it was very well I
did so, as may be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable
occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent
discoveries in these walks of something or other to my ad-
vantage; particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, who
built not as wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house
pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but
when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was
at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give
them; however, I frequently found their nests, and got their
young ones, which were very good meat.

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it
was impossible for me to make, as indeed, as to some of them,
it was; for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.
I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though
I spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads,
or joint the staves so true to one another as to make them hold
water, so I gave that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so that

92
as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump
of bees-wax with which I made candles in my African ad-
venture, but I had none of that now; the only remedy I had
was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and
with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to
which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp;
and this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light like
a candle. In the middle of all my labours it happened, that
rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted
before, had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry,
not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship
came from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had been in
the bag, was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing
in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have
the bag for some other use, I think it was to put powder in,
when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use,
I shook the husks of comgllfllfiitfln, PPeside of my fortifica-

tion under the rock.

It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned,
that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of anything,
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown anything
there; when about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some
few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground,
which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I
was surprised and perfectly astonished, when after a little
longer time I saw about ten or twelve cars come out, which
were perfect green barley of the same kind as our European,
nay, as our English barley.

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon

' no religious foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions

of religion in my head, or had entertained any sense of any-
thing that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as
we lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as inquir-
ing into the end of Providence in these things, or his order
in governing events in the world; but after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely; and I began to suggest, that God had miracu-
lously caused this grain to grow without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance
on that wild, miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of
my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy
of nature should happen upon my account; and this was the
more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by
the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved
to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen
it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Provi-
dence for my support, but not doubting but that there was
more in the place, I went all over that part of the island,
where I had been before, peeping in every comer and under
every rock to see for more of it, but I could not find any; at
last it occurred to my thought, that I had shook a bag of
chickens' meat out in that place, and then the wonder began
to cease. And I must confess, my religious thankfulness to

94 4' A" V
God's providence began to abate too, upon discovering that
all this was nothing Waggmmon; though I ought
to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a
providence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the
work of Providence as to me, that should order or appoint
ten or twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled, when the

 

rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from Aw

place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang A>> V"

up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else
at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June, and laying
up every com, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in
time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with
bread; but it was not till the fourth year that I could allow
myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but
sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost all
that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper
time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it
never came up at all, at least, not as it would have done: of
which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and
whose use was of the same kind or to the same purpose,
namely, to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways
to cook it up without baking, though I did that also after some
time. But to return to my journal.

I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get

95

.y M

"x
my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving
to go into it not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder,
that there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation.

APRIL 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up with the ladder
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down
on the inside. This was a complete inclosure to me; for within
I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had al-
most had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed.
The case was thus, As I was busy in the inside of it, behind
my tent, just in the entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for on
a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from the
roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over my head,
and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a
frightful manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing
of'what was really the cause, only thinking that the top of my
cave was falling in, as some of it had done before; and, for
fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and
not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall
for fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected might roll
down upon me. I was no sooner stepped down upon the firm
ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the
ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes'
distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned
the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood
on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which
stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with

96
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I per-
ceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it;
and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than
on the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt
the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like
one dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea. But the noise
of the falling rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me

from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror,
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my
tent, and all my household goods, and burying all at once;
and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart enough
to get over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but
sat still upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate,
not knowing what to deal] this while I had not the least
serious religious thought, nothing but the common, "Lord,
have mercy upon me," and when it was over, that went away
tooJ

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy,
as if it would rain; soon after that the wind rose by little and
little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane. The sea was all on a sudden covered over with
foam and froth, the shore was covered with the breach of the
water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible
storm it was; and this held about three hours, and then began

97
to abate, and in two hours more it was stark calm, and began
to rain very hard.

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified
and dejected, when on a sudden it came into my thoughts,
that these winds and rain being the consequences of the earth-
quake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might
venture into my cave again. With this thought my spirits
began to revive, and the rain also helping to persuade me, I
went in and sat down in my tent, but the rain was so violent,
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I
was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and
uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. -

This violent rain forced me to a new work, namely to cut
a hole through my new fortification like a sink to let water
go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I
had been in my cave some time, and found still no more
shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed.
And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very
much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum,
which however I did then, and always, very sparingly, know-
ing I could have no more when that was gone.

It continued raining all that night, and great part of the
next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being
more composed, I began to think of what I had best do,
concluding, that if the island was subject to these earth-
quakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must
consider of building me some little hut in an open place,
which I might surround with a wall as I had done here, and
so make myself secure from wild beasts or men: but con-

98
eluded if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one time or
other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from
the place where it stood, which was just under the hanging
precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again,
would certainly fall upon my tent. And I spent the next two
days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where
and how to remove my habitation.

The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me that I
never slept in quiet: and yet the apprehension of lying abroad,
without any fence, was almost equal to it; but still, when I
looked about and saw how everything was put in order, how
pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it
made me very 10th to remove.

In the mean time it occurred to me that it would require
a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be
contented to run the venture where I was, till I had formed
a camp for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it;
so with this resolution I wmposed myself for a time, and
resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a
wall with piles and cables, in a circle as before; and set my
tent up in it when it was finished, but that I would venture
to stay where I was till it was finished and fit to remove to.
This was the 21st.

Ann. 22. The next morning I began to consider of means
to put this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about
my tools; I had three large axes and abundance of hatchets
(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians),
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they

99
were all full of notches and dull, and though I had a grind-
stone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too: this cost me
as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon
a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death
of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn
it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty.
I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least not
to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed
it is very common there; besides that, my grind-stone was
very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week's
work to bring it to perfection.

man. 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools, my machine for turning my grind-stone performing
very well.

man. 30; Having perceived my bread had been low a great
while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one
biscuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.

MAY 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the
tide being low I saw something lie on the shore bigger than
ordinary; and it looked like a cask. When I came to it, I
found a' small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of
the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane;
and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to
lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined
the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was
a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and the pow-
der was caked as hard as a stone; however, I rolled it farther
on shore. for the present, and went on upon the sands as near
as I could .to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.

100
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely re-
moved: the forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was
heaved up at least six feet; and the stern, which was broken
to pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the sea,
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were,
up, and cast on one side, and the sand was thrown so high
on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great
place of water before, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised
with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the
earthquake. And as by this violence the ship was more broken
open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore,
which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water
rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re-
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that
day especially, in searching whether I could make any way
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind, for that all the inside of the ship was choked up
with sand. However, as I had learnt not to despair of any
thing, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of
the ship, concluding, that everything I could get from her
would be of some use or other to me.

MAY 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam
through, which I thought held some of the upper part or
quarter-deck together; and when I had cut it through, I
cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which

101
lay highest; but the tide coming in, I'was obliged to give
over for that time.

MAY 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when just going to
leave oil, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long
line of some rope yarn, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I
dried in the sun, and eat them dry.

MAY 5. Worked on the wreck, out another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir planks off from the decks, which
I tied together and made swim on shore when the tide of
flood came on.

MAY 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of
her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very hard, and
came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it
over.

MAY 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not
to work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself
down, the beams being cut, that several pieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose: and the inside of the hold lay so open,
that I could see into it, but almost full of water and sand.

MAY 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
or sand; I wrenched Open two planks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for
next day.

MAY 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loos-
ened them with the crow, but could not break them up; I

102
felt also the roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was
too heavy to remove.

MAY 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the wreck, and
got a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and
two or three hundredweight of iron.

MAY 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a
piece 03 the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and
a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.

MAY 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I staid so
long in the woods to get pigeons for food, that the tide pre-
vented me going to the wreck that day.

MAY 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at
a great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see
what they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but
too heavy for me to bring away.

MAY 24. Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, and
with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the
crow, that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brasil pork in it, but the
salt water and sand had spoiled it.

I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except
the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed,
during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was
up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by

103
this time I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how; and
also, I got at several times, and in several pieces, near a hun-
dredweight of the sheet-lead.

JUNE .16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a large tor-
toise or turtle; this was the first I had seen, which it seems
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scar-
city; for had I happened to be on the other side of the island,
I might have had hundreds of them every day; as I found
afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

JUNE 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her three-
score eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time the most
savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had
no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid
place.

JUNE 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at
this time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which
I knew was not usual in that latitude.

JUNE 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been
cold.

JUNE 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my head, and
feverish.

JUNE 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the ap-
prehensions of my sad condition, to be sick and no help.
Prayed to God for the first time since the storm OE Hull, but
scarce knew what I said, or why; my thoughts being all con-
fused.

JUNE 22. A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions
of sickness.

104
JUNE 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a
violent headache.

JUNE24. Muchbetter.

JUNE 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours,
cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.

JUNE 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak; however, I killed a she-
goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some
of it, and ate; I would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.

JUNE 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay a--bed all day,
and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for thirst,
but so weak I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself
any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-
headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew
not what to say; only I lay and cried, Lord, look upon me;
Lord, pity me; Lord, have mercy upon me. I suppose I did
nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I
fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night; when I
waked I found myself much refreshed, but weak and exceed-
ing thirsty: however, as I had no water in my whole habita-
tion, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.
In this second sleep I had this terrible dream.

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside
of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earth-
quake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black
cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and alight upon the ground.
He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I cauld but just
bear to look towards him; his countenance was most inex-

105
pressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe; when
he stepped upon the ground with his feet I thought the earth
trembled just as it had done before in the earthquake, and
all the air looked to my apprehension as if it had been filled
with flashes of fire.

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved
forward toward me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand
to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some
distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that
it is impossible to express the terror of it; all that I can say I
understood was this, "Seeing all these things have not brought
thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;" at which words I
thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.

No one, that shall ever read this account, will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even
dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to de-
scribe the impression that remained upon my mind, when I
awaked, and found it was but a dream.

JUNE 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep
I had had, and the fit being entirely oif, I got up; and
though the fright and terror of my dream was very great,
yet I considered, that the fit of the ague would return again
next day, and now was my time to get something to refresh
and support myself when I should be ill. And the first thing
I did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set
it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take off the
chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter
of a'pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I got

196
me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals,
but could eat very little. I walked about, but was very weak,
and vvithal, very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of
my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper
the next day. At night I made my supper of three of the
turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call
it, in the shell; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever
asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remember, in my
whole life.

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found myself so weak,
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out with-
out that); so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me,
and very calm and smooth.

I rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and
went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my
thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
' sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for
it began to be dark. Now as the apprehension of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought, that the Brasilians take no physio but their tobacco,
for almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of
tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some
also that was green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven, no d0ubtl for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body! I opened the chest,
and found what I looked for, namely the tobacco; and as
the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of
the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this time,

107
I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into; I say I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco
with me to the table.

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my dis-
temper, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried several
experiments with it, as if I resolved it should hit one way or
other: I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my
mouth, which indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the
tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been used
to it; then I took some, and steeped it an hour or two in some
rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and
lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, and I
held almost to sufiocation.

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and
began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with
the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time. Only having
opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to
me were these, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."

The words were very apt to my case, and made some im-
pression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them,
though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being
delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say, to me; the
thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel did when
they were promised flesh to eat, "gar: God spread a table
in the wilderness?" so I began to say, can God himself deliver
me from this place? And as it was not for many years that

108
any hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon my
thoughts; but, however, the words made a very great impres-
sion upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so
much, that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in
the cave, lest I should want anything' m the night, and went
to bed: but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all "my life; I kneeled down and prayed to God to fulfilv

the promise to me, that if I called upon him in the day_ of

trouble,he would deliver me. After my broken and imperfect
Bayer was over, I drank Hie rum in which I had steeped the
tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that
indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I
went to bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more,
till noon the next day; nay, to this hour I am partly of the
opinion, that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise I knew not how I should
lose a day out of my reckoning 1n the days of the week, as it
appeared some years after I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost more than
one day: but certainly I lost a day 1n my account, and never
knew which way.

Be that however one way or other, when I waked, I found
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheer-
ful. When I got up, I was stronger than I was the day before,
and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I
had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the

better. This was the 29th.

109
The 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-
fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought them
home, but was not very forward to eat them: so I eat some
more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening
I renewed the medicine which I had supposed did me good
the day before, namely, the tobacco steeped in rum; only I
did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the
leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. However, I was not so
well the next day, which was the first of July, as I hoped I
should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but
it was not much.

JULY 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, and
dosed myself with it at first, and doubled the quantity which
I drank.

JULY 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not
recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I was
thus gathering strength, my thoughts run exceedingly upon
the scripture, "I will deliver thee;" and the impossibility of
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it: but as I was discouraging myself with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so much on
my deliverance from the main afiliction, that I disregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were, made
to ask myself such questions as these; namely, Have I not
been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness? from the
most distressed condition that could be, and that was so
frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it? had I done
my part? "God had delivered me: but I had not glorified

110
him:" that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for
that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater de-
Iiverance?

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I
kneeled _down, and gave God thanks, aloud, form my recovery
from my sickness. I N
'7 JULY 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and, beginning
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and im-
posed upon myself to read awhile every morning and every
gight, not tying myself to the number of chapters, but as
long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after
I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above "Call
on me, and I will deliver thee," in a difierent sense from what
I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from the
captivity I was in: for though I was indeed at large in the
place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that,
in the worst sense in the world; but now I learned to take it in
another sense. Now I looked back upon my past life with such
horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my scul sought
nothing of God, but deliverance from the load of guilt that
bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was
nothing; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or
think of it; it was all of no consideration, in comparison of
this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read
it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they

 

111
will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than
deliverance from affliction.

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal:--

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and
my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scrip-
ture, and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had
a great deal of comfort within, which till now I knew nothing
of; also as my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself
to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make
my way of living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of JULY to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little
at a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after
a fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was,
and to what weakness I was reduced. The application which
I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never
cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any one
to practice by this experiment; and though it did carry off
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for I had
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time.

I learnt from it also this, in particular, that being abroad
in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health
that could be, especially in those rains which came attended
with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which
came in the dry season was always most accompanied with
such storms, so I found this rain was much more dangerous
than the rain which fell in September and October.

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months;

112
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured
my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to
see what other productions I might find, which I yet knew
nothing of.

. It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself; I went up the creek first,
where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after
I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry season,
there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not
enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived.

On the banks of this brook I found may pleasant savannas
or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on
the rising parts of them next to the higher grounds, where the
water, as it might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very
strong stalk. There were divers other plants which I had no
nofion of, or understanding about; and might perhaps have
virtues of their own, which I could not find out.

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians in all
that climate make their bread of, but I could not find none.
I saw large plants of aloes, but did not then understand them.
I saw several sugar canes, but wild, and for want of cultiva-
tion, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for
this time, and came back musing with myself what course I

113
might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the
fruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it
to no conclusion: for in short, I had made so little observa-
tion while I was in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants
of the field, at least very little that might serve me to any
purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and,
'after going something farther than I had done the day before,
I found the brook and the savannas began to cease, and the
country became more woody than before. In this part I found

rdifierent fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the
vines had spread indeed over the trees, and the clusters of
grapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This
was a surprising discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of
them; but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly
of them, remembering that, when I was ashore in Barbary,
the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen who
were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers:
but I found an excellent use for these grapes, and that was to
cure or dry them in the sun and keep them as dried grapes or
raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes
might be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation, which by the way was the first night, as I might
say, I had lain from home. In the night I took my first con-
trivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well, and the
next morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near

114
four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keep-
ing still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north
side of me.

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the
country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant
verdure or flourishing of spring, that it looked like a planted
garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley,
surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed
with other aflicting thoughts), to think that this was all my
own, that I was king and lord of all this country indefeasibly,
and had a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I might
have it in inheritance, as completely as any lord of a manor
, in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange and
lemon, and citron-trees, but all wild, and few bearing any
fruit; at least, not then. However, the green limes that I gath-
ered were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and
I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.

I found now I had business enough to gather and carry
home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes, as
limes, and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which
I knew was approaching.

In order to do this I gathered a heap of grapes in one
place, and a lesser heap in another place; and a great parcel
of limes, and lemons, in another place; and taking a few of

115
each with me, I travelled homeward, and resolved to come
again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry
the rest home.

' Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I
came home (so I must now call my tent, and my cave); but
before I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of
the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having broken them, and
bruised them, they were good for little .or nothing; as to the
limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest. But I was surprised,
when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and
fine when I gathered them, I found them all spread abroad,
trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there,
and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded
there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done
this; but what they were I knew not.

However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed
with their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out
branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as
I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure on the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation, the security from storms on that
side of the water, and the wood; and concluded that I had

116
pitched upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the
worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider
of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally
safe as where I now was situated, if possible, in that pleasant
and fruitful part of the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting
me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, and to consider
that I was now by the sea-side, where it was at least possible
that something might happen to my advantage, and that the
same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other
unhappy wretches to the same place, and though it was scarce
probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to en-
close myself among the hills and woods, in the centre of the
island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an
affair not only improbable, but impossible; and that therefore
I ought not by any means to remove. .

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent
much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the
month of July and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved
as above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower,
and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a
double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled
between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, some-
times two or three nights together, always going over it with a
ladder, as before; so that I fancied now I had my country
house, and my sea-coast house: and this work took me up to
the beginning of August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my

117
labour, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to
my first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the
other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave
behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished
my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August I
found the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and in-
deed were excellent good raisins of the sun: so I began to
take them down from the trees, and it was very happy that I
did so; for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I
taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
cave, but it began to rain; and from thence, which was the
14th of August, it rained more or less every day, till the middle
of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir
out of my cave for several days.

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of
my family: I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead;
and I heard no more tidings of her, till, to my astonishment,
she came home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because though I had killed
a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a
quite different kind from our European cats; yet the young
cats were the same kind of house breed like the old one; and
both my cats being females, I thought it very strange: but
from these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered

118
with cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild
beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.

' From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that
I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet.
In this confinement I began to be straitened for food: but
venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat: and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a
treat to me; and my food was regulated thus:--I eat a bunch
of raisinsfor my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the
turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for to my great misfortune I
had no vessel to boil or stew anything), and two or three of
the turtle's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover, by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave; and, by de-
grees, worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside
of the hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond
my fence or- wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had managed my-
self before, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I
thought I lay exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there
was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had
seen upon the island being a goat.

SEPTEMBER 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniver-
sary of my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and
found I had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days.
I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious
exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most
serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledg-
ing his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him

119
to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and having not
tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even to the
going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake, and a bunch
of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it.

I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for as at first
I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some
time omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer
notch than ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really
know what any of the days were; but now, having cast up
the days as above, I found I had been there a year; so I
divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a
Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account I had lost a
day or two in my reckoning.

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I con-
tented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down
only the most remarkable events of my life, without con-
tinuing a daily memorandum of other things.

The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to ap-
pear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to
provide for them accordingly. But I bought all my experience
before I had it; and this I am going to relate, was one of the
most discouraging experiments that I made at all. I have
mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice
which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thOught, of
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice,
and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper
time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its southern
position going from me. I

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as I could,

120
with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed
my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my
thought, that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not
know when was the proper fime for it; so I sowed about two-.
thirds of the seeds, leaving about a handful of each. It was a
great comfort to me afterwards that I did 'so, for not one grain
of that I sowed this fime came to anything; for the dry months
following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was
sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came
up at all, till the wet season had come again, and then it
grew as if it had been newly sown.

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of
ground to make another trial in; and I dug up a piece of
ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed
in February, a little before the vernal equinox; and this, hav-
ing the rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung
up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had
yet, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not
amounting to above half a peek of each kind.

But by this experience I was made master of my business,
and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow; and that
I might expect two seed-times, and two harvests every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were
over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the
month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower, where though I had not been some months, yet I found

121all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that
I had made, was not only firm and entire, but the stakes
which I had cut off of some trees that grew thereabouts, were
all shot out, and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow tree usually shoots the first year after lapping its head.
I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them to grow as
much alike as I could, and it is scarce credible, how beautiful
a figure they grew into in three years; so that though the
hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter,
yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered
it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all
the dry season.

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge like this in a semicircle round my wall, I mean
that of my first dwelling, which I did; and placing the trees
Or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards' distance from
my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence
also, as I shall observe in its order.

122FOUND now, that the sea-
sons of the year might gen-
erally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe,
but into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were
generally thus:

Half February, March, half April--Rainy, the sun being
then on or near the equinox.

Half April, May, June, July, half August--Dry, the sun be-
ing then to the north of the line.

Half August, September, half October--Rainy, the sun then
being come back.

Half October, November, December, January, half Feb-
ruary--Dry, the sun being then to the south of the line.

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the
winds happened to blow; but this was the general observation
I made. After I had found by experience, the ill consequences
of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with
provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out;
and I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet
months. I

123
In this time I found much employment, (and very suitable
also to the time), for I found great occasion for many things
which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour
and constant application. Particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a
boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-
maker's in the town where my father lived, to see them make
their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very
oficious to help, and a meat observer of the manner how they
worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had
by this means so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I
wanted nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind,
that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that
grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows and willows,
and osiers, in England, and I resolved to try.

Accordingly the next day I went to my country house, as I
called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them
to my purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came
the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity
which I soon found, for there was a great plenty of them.
These I set up to dry within my circle of hedges; and when
they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave; and here, dur-
ing the next season I employed myself in making (as well as
I could) a great many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry
or lay up anything, as I had occasion; and though I did not
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufliciently
serviceable for my purpose; and thus afterwards I took care

124
never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed,
I made more; especially I made strong deep baskets to place
my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any
quantity of it.

Having mastered this difliculty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two wants. I had no vessels to hold anything that was
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others,
which were case-bottles, square, for the holding of waters,
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything in,
except a great kettle which I saved out of the ship, and which
was too big for such uses as I desired for it, namely, to make
broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I
would fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impos-
sible for me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for
that too at last. ~

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or
piles, and in this wicker work, all the summer, or dry season;
when another business took me up more time than it could
be imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the
whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so
on to where I built my bower, and where I had an opening
quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved
to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that side; so taking
my gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes, and a
great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I began

125
my journey. When I had passed the vale where my bower
stood, as above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descn'ed land, whether
an island or continent I could not tell; but it lay very high,
extending from the West to the W.S.W. at a very great dis-
tance; by my guess it cauld not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other-
wise than that I lmew it must be part of America; and, as I
concluded by all my observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse condition than
I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began now to own, and to believe, or--
dered everything for the best; I say I quieted my mind with
this, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being
there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered, that
if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one
time or other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other;
but if not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish
country and Brasil, which is inhabited by the worst of sav-
ages; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their
hands.

With these considerations I walked very leisurely forward.
I found that side of the island where I now was, much pleas-
anter than mine, the open or savanna fields sweet, adorned
with flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw

126
abundance of parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if
possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak
to me. I did, after some pains taken, catch a young parrot;
for I knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it,
I brought it home, but it was some years before I could make
him speak. However, at last I taught him to call me by my
name, very familiarly: but the accident that followed, though
it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in
the low grounds, hares as I thought them to be, and foxes,
but they differed greatly from all other kinds I had met with;
nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I ldlled several:
but I had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of food,
and of that which was very good too: especially these three
sorts, goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to
my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have furnished a
better table than I, in proportion to the company: and though
my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for
thankfulness, that I was not driven to any extremities for
food; but rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright
in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-
turns, to see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary
enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for all night;
and then either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded my-
self with a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from
one tree or another, or so as no wild creature could come at
me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see

127
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island; for
here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles,
whereas on the other side I had found but three in a year
and a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many
kinds, some of which I had not seen before, and many of them
very good meat; but such as I knew not the names of, except
those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very spar-
ing of my powder and shot: and therefore had more mind to
kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on: and
though there were many more goats here than on the other
side of the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that
I could come near them; the country being flat and even, so
that they saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine, but yet I had not the least inclinah'on to remove; for as
I was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me; and
I seemed all the while I was here, to be, as it Were, upon a
journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the shore
of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles: and
then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I con-
cluded I would go home again; and the next journey I took
should be on the other side of the island, east from my dwell-
ing, and so round, till I came to my post again: of which in
its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking
I could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the coun-
try; but I found myself mistaken; for being come about two

128
or three miles, I found myself descended into a very large
valley; but so surrounded with hills, and those bills covered
with woods, that I could not see which was my way by any
direction but that of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew
very well the position of the sun at that time of the day.

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the weather
proved hazy for three or four days while I was in this valley;
and not being able to see the sun, I wandered about very un-
comfortably, and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side,
look for my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then by easy journeys I turned homeward, the weather being
exceeding hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other
things very heavy.

    
     

.il. n ' '

. N THIS JOURNEY my dog
surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running to take hold of it, caught it, and
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it
home, if I could; for I had often been musing whether it might
not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of

129
tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be spent.

I made a collar for this little creature; and with a string
which I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about
me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came
to my bower, and there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was
very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent
above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed: this
little wandering journey, without a settled place of abode,
had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called
it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that;
and it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I
resolved that I would never go a great way from it again, while
it should be my lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after
my long journey; during which, most of the time was taken
up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who
began now to be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well
acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had pent in within my little circle, and resolved to
go and fetch it home, and give it some food: accordingly
I went, and found it where I left it; for indeed it could not
get out, but was almost starved for want of food. I went and
cut boughs of trees and branches of such shrubs as I could
find, and threw over to it; and having fed it, I tied it as I did
before to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry,
that I had no need to have tied it; for it followed me like a

130
dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving,
so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time one of
my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island,
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was at-
tended with, and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God
had been pleased to discover to me, even that it was possible
I might be more happy in this solitary condition, than I should
have been in society, and in all the pleasures of the world:
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my
solitary state and the want of human society, by his presence,
and the communications of his grace to my soul, supporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his provi-
dence here, and hope for his eternal presence hereafter.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for
vieng the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would break upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would
die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the
deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the
eternal bolts and bars of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilder-
ness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest com-
posures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a
storm, and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child.

131
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and
I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look down upon
the ground for an hour or two together; and this was still
worse to me; for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself
by words, it would go 0E, and the grief, having exhausted
itself, would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it
to my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened
the Bible upon these words, "I will never, never leave the,
nor forsake thee!" Immediately it occurred, that these words
were to me, why else should they be directed in such a man-
ner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my con-
dition, as one forsaken of God and man? Well then, said I, if
God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or
what matters it, though the world should all forsake me; seeing
on the other hand, if I had all theworld, and should lose the
favour and blessing of God, there would be no comparison in
the loss.

I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within
me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without
any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods; and for
assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

In this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular
an account of my works this year as at the first, yet in general
it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle; having
regularly divided my time, according to the several daily em-
ployments that were before me, such as first, my duty to God,

132
and reading the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some
time for, thrice every day. Secondly, the going abroad with
my gun for food, which generally took me up three hours
every morning when it did not rain. Thirdly, the ordering,
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught
for my supply. These took up great part of the day. Also it
is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, the violence
of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four hours
in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work
in; with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours
of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning,
and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours
which, for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, every-
thing that I did took up out of my time: for example, I was
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a long shelf,
' which I wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the
same tree in half a day.

My case was this: It was to be a large tree which was to be
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. The tree
I was three days a cutting down, and two more cutu'ng ofi
the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides
of it into chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then
I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board,
from end to end: then turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three inches

133
thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the la-
bour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour and
patience carried me through that and many other things.

I was now in the months of November and December, ex-
pecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured or dug up for them was not great; for, as I ob-
served, my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a
peck; for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry
season; but now my crop promised very well, when on a
sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; at first, the goats, and wild creatures which I called
hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it
night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that
it could get no time to shoot up into stalks.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil; and
the more, because it required a great deal of speed; the crea-
tures daily Spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in
about three weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures
in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying
him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark
all night long: so in a little time the enemies forsook the place,
and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apaee.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in
the blade, so the birds were as like to ruin me now, when it
was in the ear; for going along by the place to see how it

134
throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls of I know
not how many sorts, which stood as it were watching till I
should be gone. I immediately let fly among them, (for I
always had my gun with me). I had no sooner shot, but there
arose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensiblnyor I foresaw, that in a few days
they would devour all my_hop_es:i_that I should be starved,
and never be able to raise a crop at all; and what to do I
could not tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the first
place, I went among it to see what damage was already done,
and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it
was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great, but
the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be saved.

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved
it to be so; for as I walked OK, as if I was gone, I was no
sooner out of their sight, but they dropped down one by one
into the corn again. I was so provoked that I could not have
patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain
that they eat now was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me
in the consequence. But coming up to the hedge, I fired again,
and killed three of them. This was what I wished for; so I
took them up, and served them, as we serve notorious thieves
in England, that is, hanged them in chains, for a terror to
others. It is almost impossible to imagine, that this should
have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not

135
come at the corn, but in short they forsook all that part of
the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as long
as my scarecrows hung there. This I was very glad of, you
may be sure, and about the latter end of December, which
was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down,
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could, out
of one of the broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among
the arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small,
I had no great difiiculty to cut it down; in short, I reaped
it my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and canied it
away in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it
out with my hands. And at the end of all my harvesting I
found, that out of my half-peck, of seed, I had near two
bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley,
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I
foresaw that in time it would please God to supply me with '
bread; and yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither
knew how to grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how
to clean it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I lcnew not how to bake
it. These things being added to my desire of having a good
quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season, and in the mean time to employ all
my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work

of providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now" _I,, WOIde, firm

136
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon; namely, the strange multitude of, little
things necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing,
making, and finishing, this one article of bread.

First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade or shovel
to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade,
as I observed before, but this did my work in but a wooden
manner; and though it cost me a great many days to make it;
yet for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but
made my work the harder, and made it be performed much
worse.

However, this I bore with too, and was content to work it
out with patience, and bear with the badness of the perform-
ance. When the corn was sowed, I had no harrow, but was
forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of
a tree over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather

thanrake or barrow it. .

' When it was growing or grown, I have observed already
how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it, mow or reap
it, cure or carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaE, and
save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and
all these things I did without, as shall be observed; and yet
the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too.
But all this, as I said, made everything laborious and tedious
to me, but that there was no help for, neither was my time so
much loss to me, because I had divided it. A certain part of
it was every day appointed to these works, and as I resolved
to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity

137
by me, I had the next six months to apply myself, wholly by
labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper
for the performing all the operations necessary for the making
the corn, when I had it, fit for my use.

'7 Ill III/"Ask.

 

T first I was to prepare
more land, for I had now seed

enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did
this, I had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which,
when it was done, was a very sorry one indeed, and very
heavy, and required double labour to work with it; however,
I went through that, and sowed my seeds in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find them to
my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of
which were all cut OE that wood which I had set before,
which I knew would grow; so that in one year's time I knew
I should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take me up less

  

138
than three months; because great part of that time was in the
wet season, when I could not go abroad.

Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could not go
out, I found employment on the following occasion, always
observing, that all the while I was at work, I diverted my-
self with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak;
and I quickly learnt him to know his own name; at last, to
speak it out pretty loud, Poll; which was the first word I ever
heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my work; for
now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as
follows: I had long studied, by some means or other, to make
myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely,
but knew not where to come at them: however, considering
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt, but if I could find
out any such clay, I might botch up some such pot, as might,
being dried by the sun, be hard enough, and strong enough,
' to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and re.
quired to be kept so; and as this was necessary in preparing
corn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved
to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like
jars to hold what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste, what
odd misshapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in,
and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over violent
heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell
to pieces with only removing, as well before as after they

139
were dried; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and
work it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly things,
I cannot call them jars, in about two months' labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two
greater wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break, and, as between the pot and
the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the
rice and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand al-
ways dry, I .thought it would hold my dry corn, and perhaps
the meal when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yet I made several smaller things with better success, such as
little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any-
thing my hand turned to, and the heat of the sun baked them
strangely hard.

- But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which
none of- these could do. It happened after some time, making
a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put
it out after I had done with it, I found a broken piece of one
of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone,
and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and
said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make
it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had

140
some lead to do it with; but I placed three large pipkins, and
two or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my
firewood all round it, with a great heap of embers under
them; I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite
through, and observed that they did not crack at all; when I
saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or
six hours, till I found one of them though it did not crack, did
melt or run. For the sand which was mixed with the clay,
melted by the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the
pots began to abate of the red colour, and watching them all
night that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning
I had three very good, I will not say handsome pipkins, and
two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired,
and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand. .

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort
of earthenware for my use, but I must needs say, as to the
shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may
suppose, when I had no way of making them, but as the
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that
never learnt to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would
hear the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were
cold, before I set one upon the fire again, with some water
in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and
with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though

141
I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to
make it so good as I would have had it.

, My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp
or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To
supply this want, I was at a great loss; for of all trades in
the world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as
for any whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with.
I spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all,
except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way
to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of
hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone,
which would neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand; so, after a
great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over,
and resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which
I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside
with my axe and hatchet; and then, with the help of fire and
infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in
Brasil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy
pestle or heater, of the wood called the iron-wood; and this
I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of corn,
when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn
ormealtomake my bread.

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, to dress my meal,
and part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did
not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most

142
difiicult thing, so much as but to think on; for to be sure, I
had nothing like the necessary things to make it with; I mean
fine thin canvas, or stuff, to sift the meal through. And here
I was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know
what to do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags;
I had goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave or spin it;
and had I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All
the remedy that I found for this, was, that at last I did re-
member I had among the seamen's clothes, which were saved
out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with
some pieces of these I made three small sieves, but proper
enough for the work: and thus I made shift for some years;
how I did afterwards, I shall shew in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first,
I had no yeast. As to that part, as there was no supplying the
want, so I did not concern myself much about it. But for an
oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an
experiment for that also, which was this: I made some earthen
vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two feet
diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by: and when
I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, which
I had paved with some square tiles of my own making and
burning also; but I should not call them square. When the
firewood was burnt pretty much into embers or live coals, I
drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over;
and there I let them lie, till the hearth was very hot: then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves;

143and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the
embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in, and add
to the heat: and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world,
I baked my barley-loaves, and became in a little time a pastry-
cook into the bargain, for I made myself several cakes of the
rice, and puddings.

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to he
observed, that in the intervals of these things, I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn in
its season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it
up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out;
for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it
with.

And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it
up in; for the increase of the corn now yielded me so much,
that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and of the
rice as much, or more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin
to use it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a great
while: also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient
for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year;
so'I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I
sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully
provide me with bread.LL THE WHILE these things

were doing, you may be sure
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land
which I had seen from the other side of the island; and
I was not without secret wishes that I was on shore there,
fancying that seeing the main land, and an inhabited coun-
try, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther,
and perhaps at last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of
savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far
worse than the lions and tigers of Africa. That if I once came
into their power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had
heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals,
or men-eaters; and I knew by the latitude that I could not
be far ofi from that shore. All these things, I say, which I
ought to have considered well of, and I did cast up in my
thoughts afterwards, yet took none of my apprehensions at

145
first; and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting
over to that shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long boat with the
shoulder-of'mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I
thought I would go and look on Our ship's boat, which, as
I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way in the
storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force
of the waves, and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against
the high ridge of a beachy rough sand, but no water about
her as before.

Had I had hands to have refitted her, and have launched
her into the water, the boat would have done well enough,
and I might have gone back into the Brasils with her easily
enough; but I might have easily foreseen, that I could no
more turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom, than I
could remove the island. However I went to the wood, and
cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving
to try what I could do; suggesting to myself, that if I could
but turn her down, I might easily repair the damage she had
received, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go
to sea in her very easily.

I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it. At last, finding it
impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand to undermine it, and so to make it
fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it
rightinthe fall.

146
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again,
or to get under it, much less to move it forwards towards the
water; so I was forced to give it over: and yet, though I gave
over hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main
increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed
impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not
possible to make myself a canoe or per-iagua, such as the
natives of those climates make, even without tools, or as I
might say, without hands, namely of the trunk of a great
tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy; and pleased
myself extremely with my thoughts of making it, and with
my having much more convenience for it than any of the
Negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the particular
inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians did,
namely want of hands to move it into the water, when it was
made; a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all
the consequences of want of tools could be to them. But my
thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it,
that I never once considered how I should get it 05 the land;
and it was really in its own nature more easy for me to guide
it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five fathom of
land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that
ever man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased
myself with the design, without determining whether I was
ever able to undertake it; not but that the difficulty of launch-
ing my boat came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer which I gave my-

147
self: Let me first make it, I will warrant I will find some way
or other to get it along when it is done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness
of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar
tree. I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one
for the building the temple of Jerusalem. It was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
after which it lessened for a while and then parted into
branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this
tree; I was twenty days hacldng and hewing at it at the bot-
tom; I was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs and
the vast spreading head of it cut off, which I hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, with inexpressible
labour; after this it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to
a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,
that it might swim upright as it ought. It cost me near three
months more to clear the inside, and work it cut so as to make
an exact boat of it; this I did indeed without fire, by mere
mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour; till I had
brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough
to have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big
enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely de-
lighted with it: the boat was really much bigger than I ever
saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my
life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for
there remained nothing but to get it into the water; and had
I gotten it into the water, I make no question but I should

148
have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to
be performed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost infinite labour too; it lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconvenience was,
it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this dis-
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth,
and so make a declivity; this I began, and it cost me a pro-
digious deal of pains; but who grudge pains that have their
deliverance in view? But when this was worked through, and
this difficulty managed, it was still much at one; for I could
no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to
cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing
I could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began
this work, and when I began to enter into it, and calculated
how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to be
thrown out, I found that by the number of hands I had, being
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve years
before I should have gone through with it; for the shore lay
high, so that at the upper end it must have been at least
twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctancy,
I gave this attempt over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late,
the "folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and
before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through
with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and

149
with as much comfort, as ever before; for by a constant study,
and serious application of the word of God, and by the as-
sistance of his grace, I gained a difierent knowledge from
what I had before. I entertained different notions of things;
I looked now upon the world as a thing remote; which I had
nothing to do with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires
about: in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor
was ever like to have; so I thought it looked, as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, namely as a place I had lived in,
but was come out of it. And well might I say, as Father
Abraham to Dives, "Between me and thee there is a great
gulph fixed."

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness
of the world here: I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, or the pride of life: I had nothing to covet, for I
had all I was now capable of enjoying. I was lord of the
manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor
over the whole c0untry which I had possession of; there were
no rivals: I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty
or command with me. I might have raised ship-loadings of
corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought
enough for my occasion: I had tortoises, or turtles enough;
but now and then one was as much as I could put to any use:
I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; I had
' grapes encugh to have made wine, or to have cured into
raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been built.

I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold
as silver, about thirty-six pOund sterling; alasl there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business for it,

150
and I often thought with myself, that I would have given a
handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill
to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for six-penny
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a
handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink.

I had now been here so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help, were either quite gone, or very
much wasted, and near spent. My ink, as I observed, had
been gone for some time, all but a very little, which I eked
out with water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as it
lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days of the month
on which any remarkable thing happened to me, and first,
by casting up times past, I remembered that there was a
strange concurrence of days, in the various providences which
befell me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined
to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason
to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull in order
to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the
Sallee man of war, and made a slave.

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck
of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day of the year
afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.

Themedaygf the year I was born on, namely, the 30th of
September, the same--day I had my life so miraculously saved

,_ Elegswgfter; when I Was cast on shore in this island; so
that my wicked life, and solitary life, both began on a day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship.
- This I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself
but one cake of bread a day for above a year, and yet I was
quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn of
my own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any
at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next
to miraculous.

My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had
had none a good while, except some chequered shirts which
I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I care-
fully preserved, because many times I could bear no other
clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me,
that I had among all the men's clothes of the ship almost three
dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-coats of
the seamen's, which were left indeed, but they were too hot
to wear; and though it is true, that the weather was so violent
hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go
quite naked; no, though I had been inclined to it, which I
was not; nor could I abide the thoughts of it, though I was
all alone.

One reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could
not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as
with some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered
my skin; whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some
motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler
than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out
in the heat of the sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the
sun beating with such violence as it does in that place, would

152
give me the headache presently, by darting so directly on my
head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it;
whereas if I put on my hat, it would presently go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the
few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now
to try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
which I had by me, and with such other materials as I had;
so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching; for
I made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift to
make two or three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me
a great while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very
sorry shift indeed, till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them
up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some
of them were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little;
but others, it seems, were very useful. The first thing I made
of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the
outside to shoot OR the rain, and this I performed so well,
that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins;
that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees,
and both loose; for they were rather wanted to keep me cool,
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge, that
they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worse tailor; however, they were such as I made very
good shift with; and when I was abroad, if it happened to
rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being outmost, I was

kept very dry.

umbrella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great
mind to make one. I had seen them made in the Brasils,
where they are very useful in the great heats which are there;
and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be
much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for
the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was
a great while before I could make anything likely to hold;
nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three
before I made one to my mind; but at last I made one that
answered indifferently well; the main difficulty I found was
to make it to let down. I could make it to spread; but if it
did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be portable
for me any way, but just over my head, which would not do.
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer. I covered
it With skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like
a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I
could walk out in the hottest of the weather, with greater
advantage than I could before in the coolest; and when I
had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed by resigning to the will of God, and throwing my-
self wholly upon the disposal of his Providence.

154Meg.
CANNOT SAY, that after this,
for five years, any extraordi-
nary thing happened to me; but I lived on in the same
course, in the same posture and place just as before; the chief
thing I was employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting
my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I
always kept up just enough to have suficient stock of the
year's provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour,
and my daily labour of going out with my- gun, I had one
labour to make me a canoe, which at last I finished: so that
by digging a canal to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, I
brought it into the creek, almost half a mile.

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had
in view, when I made the first; I mean of venturing over to
the terra firma, where it was above forty miles broad; ac-
cordingly, the smallness of my boat, assisted to put an end
to that design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I had
a boat, my next design was to make a tour round the island;
for as I had been on the other side, in one place, crossing,

as I have already described it, over the land, so the discoveries

155
I made in that journey, made me very eager to see other
parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing
but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do everything with dis-
cretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's
sails, which lay in store, and of which I had a great store by
me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers and boxes
at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and
ammunition, 810. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or
the spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in
the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a
flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sunvoif me,
like an awning; and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea, but never went far out,'nor far from the
little creek. But at last, being eager to view the circumference
of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accord-
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage; putting in two
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of
barley-bread; an earthen'pot full of parched rice, a food I
ate a great deal of; a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and
powder with shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats,
of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of
the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the
other to cover me inthe night.

156
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage,
and I found it much longer than I expected: for though the
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east
side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it; and
beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more; so
that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that
point.

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it
might oblige me to go out to sea, and above all, doubting
how I should get back again; so I came to an anchor, for I
had made me a kind of an anchor, with a piece of broken
grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on shore,
climbing up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where
I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong, and indeed, a most furious current, which
ran to the east, and even came close to the point; and I took
' the more nofice of it, because I saw there might be some
danger, that when I came into it, I might be carried out to
sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the island
again. And indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I
believe it would have been so; for there was the same current
on the other side of the island, only that it set it off at a
farther distance; and I saw there was a strong eddy under

157
the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first
current, and I should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind blowing
pretty fresh (E. at SE. and that being just contrary to the
said current) made a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore
for the breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream.

The third day in the morning, the wind having abated
over-night, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not my boat's
length from the shore, but I f0und myself in a great depth
of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It carried
my boat along with it with such violence, that all I could do
could not keep her so much as on the edge of it: but I found
it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which
was on the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me,
and all that I could do with my paddles signified nothing.
And now I began to give myself over for lost: for, as the
current was on both sides the island, I knew in a few leagues'
distance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably
gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it: so that I
had no prospect before me but of perishing; not by the sea,
for that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I had
indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of
fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots. But what
was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be

158
sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thou-
sand leagues at least!

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make the most miserable condition that mankind could
be in worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary
island, as the most pleasant place in the world, and that all
the happiness my heart could wish for, was to be there again.
I stretched Out my hands to it with eager wishes. 0 happy
desert, said I, I shall never see thee more! 0 miserable crea-
turel said I, whither am I going? Then I reproached myself
with my unthanldul temper, and how I had repined at my
solitary condition. And now what would I give to be on shore
there again! Thus we never see the true state of our condition,
fill it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor know how to
value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce possible
to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven from
my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into
the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair
of ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till in-
deed my strength was almost exhausted; and kept my boat
as much to the northward, that is, towards the side of the
current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when
about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt
a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the
S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when in
about half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale.
By this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the
island; and, had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened,
I had been undone another way too; for I had no compass

159
on board, and should never have known how to have steered
towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it. But the
weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water, some
alterafion of the current was near; for where the current was
so strong, the water was foul. But perceiving the water clear,
I found the current abate, and presently I found to the east,
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks.
These rocks I found caused the current to part again; and as
the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse
of the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again
to the north-west with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brOught to
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just
going to murder them, or who have been in such like ex-
tremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, and
how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy. And
the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it,
running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide
or eddy under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more
towards the northward than the current lay, which carried
me away at first; so that when I came near the island, I
found myself open' to the northern shore of it, that is to say,

160
the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went
out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by
the help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and
served me no farther. However, I found, that being between
the two great currents, namely that on the south side which
had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay about
two leagues on the other side; I say, between these two, in
the west of the island, I found the water at least still, and
running no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me,
I kept on steering directly for the island, though not making
such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about
a league of the island, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
north-west, and in about an hour came within about a mile
of the shore: it being smooth water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts
of my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with
such things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore,
in a little cove that I had espied under some trees, and laid
me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and
fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the
case, to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and
what might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I
lcnew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures;
so I only resolved in the morning to make my way westward

161
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the
shore, I came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a. mile over,
which. narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook,
where I found a convenient harbour for my boat, and where
she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose
for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe,
I went on shore to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where
I had been before when I travelled on foot to that shore; so
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella,
for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The way was
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found
everything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good
order, being, as I said before, my country-house.

I' got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to
rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep. But judge
you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must
be in, when 'I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling
me by my name several times, "Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe,
poor Robin Crusoe!" "Where are you, Robin Crusoe?" "Where
are you?" "Where have you been?

I was so dead asleep'at first, being fatigued with rowing,
or paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and walking
the latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly; and dozing
between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that some-
body spoke to mei but as the voice continued to repeat

162
"Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," at last I began to awake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and started
up in the utmost consternation. But no sooner were my eyes
open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and
immediately knew that this was he that spoke to me; for just
in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and
teach him. And he had learned it so perfectly, that he would
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and
cry, "Poor Robin Crusoe, where are you?" "Where have you
been?" "How came you here?"---a.nd such things as I had
taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before
I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature
got thither, and then how he should just keep about the place,
and nowhere else: but as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, the sociable creature
came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and
continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I
come here? and where had I been? just as if he had been
overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him home along
with me.

I had enough of rambling to sea for some fime, and enough
to do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I
had been in. I would have been very glad to have had my
boat again on my side of the island, but I knew not how it
was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the island,
which I had gone round, I lcnew well enough there was no

163
venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my
very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other
side of the island, I did not know how it might be there; but
supposing the current ran with the same force against the
shore at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I might run
the same risk of being driven down the stream, and carried by
the island, as I had been before of being carried away from it:
so with these thoughts I contented myself to be without any
boat, though it had been the product of so many months'
labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a year,
lived a very sedate retired life, as you may well suppose; and
my thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition,
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispensations
of Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all
things except that of society.

I improved myself, in this time, in all the mechanic ex-
ercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself to;
and I believe c0uld, upon occasion, have made a very good
carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with
a wheel, which I faund infinitely easier and better, because
I made things round and shapeable, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I never was more vain
of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and
though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done,
and only burnt red like other earthen-ware, yet as it was

164
hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly
comforted with it; for I had been always used to smoke, and
there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not
knowing there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards
when I searched the ship again, I could not come at any
pipes at all.

In my wickerware I also improved much, and made
abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention
shewed me, though not very handsome, yet convenient for
my laying things up in, or fetching things home in. For ex-
ample, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree,
flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home
in a basket; and the like by a turtle: I could cut it up, take
out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough
for me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest
behind me: also large deep baskets were my receivers for my
corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as' it was dry, and
cured; and kept it in great baskets instead of a granary.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably;
and this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply:
then I began seriously to consider what I must do when I
should have no more powder; that is to say, how should I do
to kill any goats. I had, as I observed, in the third year of
my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her tame. I was
in hopes of getting a he-kid, but I could not by any means
bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere
age.

165UT BEING now in the elev-

enth year of my residence,
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set
myself to study some art to tap and snare the goats, to
see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and partic-
ularly I wanted a she-goat great with young. To this purpose
I made snares to hamper them; and believe they were more
than once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I
had no wire, and always found them broken, and my bait
devoured. At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug several
large pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the
goats used to feed, and over these pits I placed hurdles of
my own making too, with a great weight upon them; and
several times I put ears of barley, and dry rice, without setting
the trap; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone
in, and eaten up the corn, for I could see the mark of their
feet: at length, I set three traps in one night, and going the
next morning, I found them all standing, and yet the bait
eaten and gone. This was very discouraging; however, I al-

166tered my trap; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going
one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a large
old he-goat; and in one of the others, three kids, a male and
two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was
so fierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to
go about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted;
I could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end; so I e'en let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been frightened out of his wits; but I did
not then know what I afterwards learned, that hunger would
tame a lion: if I had let him stay there three or four days
without food, and then have carried him some water to drink,
and then a little corn, he would have been as tame as one
of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures,
where they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better
at that time; then I went to the three kids; and taking them
one by one, I tied them with strings together; and with some
difficulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to
be tame: and now I found that if I expected to supply myself
with goat's flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have
them about my house like a flock of sheep. But then it pres-
ently occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the
wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up;
and the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece

167
of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep
them in so eEectually, that those within might not break out,
or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as
I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first
piece of work was to find out a proper piece of ground; namely,
where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures, will think I had
very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very
proper for all these, being a plain open piece of meadow-land,
or savanna (as our people call it in the western colonies)
which had two or three little rills of fresh water in it, and at
one end was very woody; I say they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this piece of
ground in such a manner, that my hedge, or pale, must have
been at least two miles about; nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was like
to have time enough to do it in; but I did not consider, that
my goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they had
had the whole island; and I should have so much room to
chase them in, that I should never catch them.

My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently
stopped short, and for the first beginning I resolved to enclose
a piece of about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth,
which as it would maintain as many as I should have in any
reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, I could add more
ground to my enclosure.

168
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months edging in the first
piece; and till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible,
to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished,
and I let them loose, they would follow me up and down,
bleating after me for a handful of corn.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years more I had three-and-forty, besides several I took and
killed for my food; and after that I enclosed five several pieces
of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into,
to take them as I wanted them; and gates out of one piece
of ground into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's-flesh to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which indeed
in my beginning I did not so much as think of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable sur-
prise; for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies
of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, very readily and handily,
though after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me
both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it after-
wards.

How mercifufly can our great Creator treat his creatures,

169
even in those conditions in which they seemed to be over-
whelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten the bitterest
providences, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons
and prisons] What a table was here spread for me in a wilder-
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner: there was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my
subjects at absolute command; I could hang, draw, give
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all my subjects!

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended
by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favorite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me; my dog, which was now
grown old and crazy, and found no species to multiply his
kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one
on one side the table, and one on the other, expecting now
and then a bit from my hand as a mark of special favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore
at first; for they were both of them dead, and had been in-
terred near my habitation by my own hands; but one of them
having multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these
were two which I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild
into the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last;
for they would often come into my house, and plunder me
too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a
great many. At length they left me with this attendance, and
in this plenfiful manner I lived; neither could I be said to
want anything but society, and of that, in some time after
this, I was like to have too much.

17o
I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the
use of my boat, though very 10th to nm any more hazard:
and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her
about the island, and at other times I sat myself down con-
tented enough without her. But I had a strange uneasiness
in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as
I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how
the shore lay, and how the current set, that I might see what
I had to do: this inclination increased upon me every day;
and at length I resolved to travel thither by land, and follow-
ing the edge of the shore, I did so: but had any one in England
been to meet such a man as I was, it must either have frighted
them or raised a great deal of laughter; and, as I frequently
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my traveIJing through Yorkshire with such an equi-
page, and in such a dress. I had a great high shapeless cap,
made of goat's-skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off from
running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these cli-
mates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes. I had a
short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts coming down to about
the middle of my thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches
of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of an old
he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side,
that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs.
Stockings and shoes I had none; but I made me a pair of
something, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to
flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes;

171
but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest

ofmy clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which I drew

together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles;
and in a kind of frog on either side of this, instead of a sword
and dagger, hung a little saw and hatchet; one on one side,
one on the other: I had another belt not so broad, and fas-
tened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder;
and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,
both made of goat's-skin too; in one of which hung my pow-
der, in the other my shot: at my back I carried my basket, on
my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy ugly
goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most nec-
essary thing I had about me, next to my gun: as for my face,
the colour of it was really not so Mulatto-like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My heard I had once
suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long;
but, as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it
pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I
had seen worn by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee: for the
Moors did not wear such though the Turks did. Of these
mustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough
to hang my hat upon them; but they were of length and
shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.

But all this is by--the-bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few
to observe me that it was no manner of consequence, so I say

172
no more to that part: in this kind of figure I went my new
journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along
the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my
boat to an anchor to get up upon the rocks; and, having no
boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way
to the same height that I was upon before; when looking
forward to the point of the rock which I was obliged to double
with my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see the sea
all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current,
any more there than in other places.

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to
spend some time in the observing of it, to see if nothing from
the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently
convinced how it was; namely, that the tide of ebb setting
from the west, and joining with the current of waters from
some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this
current; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly
from the west, or from the north, this current came nearer or
went farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till eve-
ning, I went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb
being made, I plainly saw the current again as before, only
that it ran farther 0E, being near half a league from the shore:
whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and hurried
me and my canoe along with it, which at another time it
would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I
might very easily bring my boat about the island again. But
when I began to think of putting it in practice I had such a

173
terror upon my Spirits at the remembrance of the danger I
had been in, that I could not think of it again with any pa-
tience; but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution,
which was more safe though more laborious; and this was,
that I would build, or rather make me another periagua, or
canoe, and so have one for one side of the island, and one
for the other.

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it,
two plantations in the island; one, my little fortification or
tent, with the wall about it under the rock, with the cave
behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into several
apartments or caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door yet beyond my
wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall
joined to the rock, was all filled up with large earthen pots,
of which I have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen
great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each,
where I laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn,
some in the ear cut ofl short from the straw, and the other
rubbed out with my hands.

As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind
them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-
ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which
duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever I

174
had occasion for more com I had more land adjoining as
fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a toler-
able plantafion there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as
I called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I kept the
hedge which circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside: I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but were
now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut,
that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make
the more agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always standing,
being a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that pur-
pose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing; and
under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins
of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and
a blanket laid on them, such as belonged toour sea-bedding,
which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me; and
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief
seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is
to say, my goats: and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of
pains to fence and enclose this ground, I was so uneasy to
see it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I
never left 0E, till with infinite labour I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one an-
other, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scarce room to put a hand through between them, which after-
wards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next

175
rainy season, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed
stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary
for my comfortable support; for I considered the keeping up
a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living
magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me, as long as
I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that
keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my per-
fecting my enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure
of keeping them together; which by this method indeed I so
effectually secured that, when these little stakes began to
grow, I had planted them so very thick I was forced to pull
some of them up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I princi-
pally depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which
I never failed to preserve very carefully as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were
not only agreeable, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and
refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half way between my other habita-
tion and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally
staid and lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently
to visit my boat, and I kept all things about or belonging
to her in very good order. Sometimes I went out in her to
divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore,
I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge

176
again by the currents, or winds, or any other accident. But
now I come to a new scene of my life.

   

, _ .T _ HAPPENED one day about

' - ' noon, going towards my boat,
I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's
flaked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen
in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had
seen an apparih'on. I listened, I looked raund me, I could
hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground
to look farther. I went up the shore, and down the shore, but
it was all one, I could see no other impression but that one.
I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to ob-
serve if it might not be my fancy, but there was no room for
that, for there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel,
and every part of a foot: how it came thither I knew not, nor
could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering
thoughts, like a man perfectly confused, and Out of myself,
I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the
ground I went on, but tenified to the last degree, looking

177
behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush
and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a
man. Nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes
an affn'ghted imagination represented things to me in; how
many wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my
thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever
after this, I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over
by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in
the rock, which I called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor
could I remember the next morning; for never frighted hare
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I
to this retreat.

I had no sleep that night; the farther I was from the oc-
casion of my fright the greater my apprehensions were; which
is something contrary to the nature of such things, and es-
pecially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear. But
I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even
though I was now a great way off it.

At last I concluded that it must be some more dangerous
creature; namely, that it must be some of the savages of the
main land over against me who had wandered out to sea in
their canoes, and, either driven by the currents or by con-
trary winds, had made the island, and had been on shore,
but were gone away again to sea, being as 10th, perhaps, to
have staid in this desolate island as I would have been to
have had them. '

178
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind I was
very thankful in my thought that I was so happy as not to
be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my
boat, by which they would have concluded that some in-
habitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched
farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imaginations
about their having found my boat, and that there were people
here; and that, if so, I should certainly have them come again
in great numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so
that they sh0uld not find me, yet they would find my en-
closure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my flock of tame
goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear bamshed_ all my religious hope; all that
former confidence in God which was founded upon such won-
derful experience as I had had of his goodness, now vanished;
serve by his power the prevision which he had made for me
by his goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness, that
would not sow any more com one year than would just serve
me till the next season, as if no accident could intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground.
And this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years' corn before-hand, so that
whatever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular effect of my cogi--
tations on this occasion I cannot omit; namely, one morning
early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my
danger from the appearance of savages, I found it discom-

179
posed me very much; upon which those words of the Scrip-
ture came into my thoughts, "Call upon me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.'

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions and re-
flections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might
be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the
print of my own foot when I came on shore from my boat.
This cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade my-
self it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot; and why might not I come that way from the boat
as well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I con-
sidered also that I could by no means tell for certain where
I had trod, and where I had not; and that, if at last this
was only the print of my own foot; I had played the part of
those fools, who strive to make stories of spectres and appari-
tions and then are themselves frighted at them more than any-
body else.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again; for
I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights,
so that I began to starve for provision; for I had little or
nothing within doors but some barley-cakes and water. Then
I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually
was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and indeed it
almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.

Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that this was
nothing but the print of one of my own feet (and so I might
be truly said to start at my own shadow), I began to go abroad
again, and went to my country-house to milk my flock; but to

180
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my
basket, and run for my life; it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I
had been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed I had.

However, as I went down thus two or three days, and
having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to
think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination;
but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I should go
down to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and
measure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude
of fitness, that I might be assured it was my own foot. But
when I came to the place first, it appeared evidently to me,
that when I laid up my boat I could not possibly be on shore
anywhere thereabouts. Secondly, when I came to measure
the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so large
by a great deal. Both these things filled my head with new
imaginations and gave me the vapours again to the highest
degree, so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and I
went home again, filled with the belief that some man or men
had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and
what course to take for my security I knew not.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night;
but in the morning I fell asleep, and having by the amusement
of my mind been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted,
I slept very soundly, and awaked much better composed than
I had ever been before. And now I began to think sedately;
and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that

181
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no
farther from the main land than as I had seen, was not so
entirely abandoned as I might imagine. That although there
were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot; yet that
there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who,
either with design, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross winds, might come to this place.

That I had lived here fifteen years now and had not met
with the least shadow or figure of any people before; and
that, if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable
they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they
had never thought fit to fix there upon any occasion to this
time.

That the most I could suggest any danger from was from
any such casual accidental landing of straggling people from
the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither,
were here against their wills; so they made no stay here but
went off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore lest they should not have the help of the tides
and day-light back again. And that therefore I had nothing
to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see
any savages land upon the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said,
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock.
Upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw
me a sewnd fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a
distance from my wall, just where I planted a double row of
trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention:

182
these trees having been planted so thick before there wanted
but a few piles to be driven between them, that they should
be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be finished.

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything
I could think of to make it strong; having in it seven holes
about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of
this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, continually
bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of
the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that
I got seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say, I planted
like my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held them
like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in two
minutes' time: this wall I was many a weary month in fin-
ishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my
wall, for a great way every way, as full with stakes or sticks
of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they
could well stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be-
tween them and my wall, that I might have room to see an
enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees,
if they attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove, and in five or
six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, grown so
monstrous thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly im-
passable; and no man of what kind soever would ever imagine
that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation.

183
As for the way I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left
no avenue) it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the
rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to
place another ladder upon that; so, when the two ladders
were, taken down, no man living could come down to me with-
out mischiefing himself; and if they had come down they
were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it will be seen at length, that

they were not altogether without just reason, though I fore-
saw nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested.

While this was doing I was not altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a present supply to me
upon every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, with-
out the expense of powder and shot, but also abated the
fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath
to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse
up over again.

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think but
of two ways to preserve them: one was to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened
to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again
with little trouble and time: and this, though it would require

I 184
a great deal of time and labour, I thought was the most
rational design.

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island, and I pitched upon one, which was as
private indeed as my heart could wish; for it was a little
damp piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick
woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before,
endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of
the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three
acres, so surrounded with woods that it was almost an en-
closure by nature; at least it did not want near so much labour
to make it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so
hard at.

IMMEDIATELY went to work
with this piece of ground,
and in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round
that my flock or herd, call it which you please, which
were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to

be, were well enough seemed in it. So, without any farther

 

 

185
delay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece;
and, when there, I continued to perfect the fence till I made
it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more
leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal.

All this labour I was at the expense of purely from my
apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot
which I had seen; for as yet I never saw any human creature
come near the island, and I had now lived two years under
these uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much less com-
fortable than it was before, as may well be imagined by any
who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear
of man.

But to go on: after I had thus seemed one part of my
little living stock, I went about the whole island searching for
another private place to make such another deposit; when
wandering more to the west point of the island than I had
ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat
upon the sea at a great distance. I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved out
of our ship; but I had it not about me; and this was so remote
that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
till my eyes were not able to look any longer. Whether it was
a boat or not I do not know; but as I descended from the hill
I could see no more of it, so I gave it over, only I resolved to
go no more without a perspective glass in my pocket.

When I was come down the hill, to the end of the island,
where indeed I had never been before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such
a strange thing in the island as I imagined; and, but that it

186
was a special Providence that I was cast upon the side of
the island where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes
from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out
at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over
to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, be-
ing all cannibals, they would kill and eat them: of which
hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the S.W. point of the island, I was perfectly
confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express
the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls,
hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particu-
larly I observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is
supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman
feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things that I
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a
long while; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror
of the degeneracy of human nature; which, though I had
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in
short, I,turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting,
when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach, and,
having vomited with an uncommon violence I was a little

187
relieved, but could not hear to stay in the place a moment;
so I got me up the hill again with all the speed I could, and
walked on towards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood
still awhile as amazed; and then, recovering myself, I looked
up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood
of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks that had cast my first
lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished from
such dreadful creatures as these; and, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so
many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks
for than to complain of; and this above all, that I had, even
in this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowl-
edge of himself, and the hope of his blessing, which was a
felicity more than suficiently equivalent to all the misery
which I had suffered or could suffer.

In this frame of thanlcfulness I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before; for I observed that
these wretches never came to this island in search of what
they could get; perhaps not seeking, nor wanting, Or not ex-
pecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up
in the covered woody part of it without finding anything to
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen
years and never saw the least footsteps of a human creature
there before; and might be here eighteen years more as en-
tirely concealed as I was now if I did not discover myself to
them, which I had no manner of occasion to do, it being my
only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was,

188
unless I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to.

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched
inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another
up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within
my own circle for almost two years after this: when I say my
own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, namely,
my castle, my country-seat, which I called my bower, and
my enclosure in the woods; nor did I look after this for any
other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion
which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that
I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself;
nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of never making any more attempts
to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should
meet with some of these creatures at sea, in which, if I had
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would
have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear
off my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the
same composed manner as before, only with this difference,
that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun,
lest any. of them being on the island should happen to hear
it; and it was therefore a very good providence to me, that I

had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, that I had

189
no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them;
and if I did catch any more of them after this it was with
traps and snares, as I had done before: so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I
never went out without it; and, which was more, as I had
saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out
with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin
belt. I likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I
had out of the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also;
so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I
went abroad, if you add to the former description of myself
the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging
at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I
seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former
calm sedate way of living; all these things tended to show
me more and more how far my condition was from being
miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other par-
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reflecting, how little repining
there would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if
people would rather compare their condition with those that
are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing
them with those which are better to assist their murmurings
and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so indeed I thought the frights I had
been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had
been in for my own preservation, had taken oil the edge of

19deg
my invention for my own conveniences; and I had dropt a
good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon; and
that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley into
malt, and then try to brew myself some beer: this was really
a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the
simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the want
of several things necessary to the making my beer, that it
would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to pre-
serve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already,
I could never compass; no, though I spent not many days,
but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose.
In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast
to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet,
had not all these things intervened, I mean the frights and
terrors I was in about the savages, I had undertaken it, and
perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything
over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my
head enough to begin it.

But my invention now ran quite another way; for night
and day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy
some of these monsters in their cruel bloody entertainment,
and if possible, save the victim they should bring hither to
destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances I
hatched, or rather brooded upon in my thoughts, for the
destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them, so
as to prevent their coming hither any more; but all was
abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect unless I
was to be there to do it myself; and what could one man do

191
among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty
of them together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows,
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could
with my gun?

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds of gim-
powder, which, when they kindled their fire, would conse-
quently take fire, and blow up all that was near it; but, as
in the first place I should be very loath to waste so much
powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity
~ of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going OE at any
certain time when it might surprise them; and, at best, that
it would do little more than just blow the fire about their
ears, and fright them, but not suficient to make them forsake
the place; so I laid it aside, and then proposed that I would
place myself in ambush, in some convenient place, with my
three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their
bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to
kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot: and then
falling in upon them with my three pistols and my sword,
I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill
them all: this fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and
I was so full of it that I often dreamt of it, and sometimes,
that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.

I went so far with it in my indignation, that I employed
myself several days to find out proper places to put myself
in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them; and I went fre-
quently to the place itself, which was now grown more famil-
iar to me; and especially while my mind was thus filled with

192
thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty
of them to the sword, as I may call it; but the horror I had
at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches
devouring one another, abated my malice.

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill,
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of
the boats coming, and might then, even before they would
be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into thickets
of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough to
conceal me entirely, and where I might sit and observe all
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads,
when they were so close together so that it would be next to
impossible that I should miss my shoot, or that I could fail
wounding three or four of them at the first shoot.

In this place then I resolved to fix my design, and accord-
ingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece.
The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and
four or five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets,
and the fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-
shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about
four bullets each; and in this posture, well provided with
ammunition for a-second and third charge, I prepared myself
for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and in my
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour
every morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my
castle, as I called it, about three miles or more, to see if I
could observe any boats upon the sea coming near the island,
or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard

193
'duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my
watch; but came always back without any discovery, there
having not in all that time been the least appearance, not
only on or near the shore, but not on the whole ocean, so
far as my eyes or glasses could reach every way.

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so out-
rageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked
savages, for an offence which I had not at all entered into a
discussion of in my thoughts, any further than my passions
were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural
custom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been
sufiered by Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, to
have no other guide than that of their own abominable and
vifiated passions; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps
had been for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive
such dreadful customs as nothing but nature entirely aban-
doned of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy,
could have run them into; but now, when, as I have said, I
began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had
made so long, and so far, every morning in vain; so my opinion
of the action itself began to alter, and I began, with cooler
and calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was going to
engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge
and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven
had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished, to
go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments
upon one another;'aiso, how far these people were ofienders

194
against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel
of that blood which they shed promiscuously one upon an-
other. I debated this very often with myself thus: How do I
know what God himself judges in this particular case? It is
certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not
against their own consciences reproving, or their light re-
proaching them. They do not know it to be an offence, and
then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost
all the sins we commit. They think it no more a crime to
kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor to
eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily,
that I was certainly in the wrong in it; tha'tihesepeople
were not murderers ' 6 sense that I had before condemned
them in my thoughts, 811M" thoseC fighrjstianswere
murderers, whdoftgnmto death the pnsongrstgkgw m ba_t-

tle,_or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole

Wmthout giving quarter, though
th ey ew own their arms and submitted.

In the next 131363,} occurred to me, that albeit the usage
they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet
it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no
injury: that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for
my immediate preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of their power,
and they had really no knowledge of me, and consequently
no design upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me
to fall upon them: that this would justify the conduct of the

Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in America, where

195
they destroyed millions of these people, who, however they
were idolaters and barbarians, and had several bloody and
barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very inno-
cent people; and that the roofing them out of the country is
spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestafion, even
by the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all other
Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man;
and such, as for which the very name of a Spaniard is reck-
oned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity,
or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were
particularly eminent for the product of a race of men, who
were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels
of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of a
generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a
kind of a full stop; and I began by little and little to be off
my design, and to conclude I had taken a wrong measure in
my resolutions to attack the savages; that it was not my busi-
ness to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me, and
this it was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that, if I
were discovered and attacked, then I knew my duty.

0n the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really
was the way, not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and
destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that
not only should be on shore at that time, but that should
ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to
tell their country-people what had happened, they would

196
come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their
fellows; and I should only bring upon myself a certain de-
struction, which at present I had no manner of occasion for.

Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in principles
nor in policy, I ought one way or other to concern myself in
this affair: that my business was by all possible means to con-
ceal myself from them, and not to leave the least signal to
them to guess by, that there were any living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape.

Religion joined in with this prudential resolution, and I
was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out of
my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the
destruction of innocent creatures, I mean innocent as to me;
as to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I
had nothing to do with them; they were nafional, and I ought
to leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor of
nations, and knows how by national punishments to make a
just retribution for national offences; and to bring public judg-
ments upon those who offend in a public manner, by such
ways as best please him.

7'1"" 0:," N THIS DISPOSITION 1 con-

tinued for near a year after
this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling
upon these wretches, that in all that time I never once went
up the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or
to know whether any of them had been on shore there or not;
that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances
against them, or be provoked, by any advantage which might
present itself, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went and
removed my boat, which I had on the other side the island,
and carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where
I ran it into a little cove which I found under some high
rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the sav-
ages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats,
upon any account whatsoever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither; namely, a mast and sail, which I had made

198for her, and a thing like an anchor, but indeed, which could
not be called either anchor or grappling: however, it was the
best I could make of its kind. All these I removed, that there
might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any ap-
pearance of any boat, or of any habitation upon the island.

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than
ever, and seldom went from my cell other than upon my con-
stant employment, namely, to milk my she-goats, and manage
my little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other
part of the island, was quite out of danger: for certain it is,
that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any thoughts of finding anything here, and
consequently never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt
not but they might have been several times on shore, after my
apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as be-
fore; and indeed I looked back with some horror upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been, if I had
chopped upon them, and been discovered when naked and
unarmed, except with my gun, and that loaded often only
with small shot. I walked everywhere peeping and peeping
about the island, to see what I could get. What a surprise
should I have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a
man's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages,
and found them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of their
mnning, no possibility of my escaping them!

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within
me, and distressed my mind so much, that I could not soon
recover it. I confess that these anxieties, these constant dan- '
gets I lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put

199
an end to all invention, and to all the conirivances that I had
laid for my future accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of
my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood
now, for fear the noise I should make should be heard; much
less would I fire a gun, for the same reason; and above all, I
was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke,
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray
me: and for this reason I removed that part of my business

which required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c.
into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been
some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere
natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and
where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it,
would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would any
man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see an
abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Provi-
dence), I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to
make charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe the reason
of my making this charcoal, which was thus:

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I
said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
bread, cooking my meat, the. so I contrived to burn some wood
here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became
chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved

200
the coal to carry home, and perform the other services which
fire was wanting for at home, without danger of smoke.

But this is by the bye. While I was cutting down some
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of
low brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow
place. I was curious to look into it, and, getting with difficulty
into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to
say, suficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps
another with me; but I must confess to you, I made more
haste out than I did in; when looking farther into the place,
which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of

, some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which
twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the cave's mouth
shining directly in, and making the reflection.

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began
to call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that
W afraid to see the d ' .WfiPQt fit to_1ixgitvzC/nty.years in
an island all alone, and that I durst to believe there was noth-
ing in this cave that was more frightful than myself: upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great firebrand, and
in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand. I had
not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much frighted
as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a
man in some pain; and it was followed by a broken noise, as
if of words half-expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I
stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise,
that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on
my head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have
lifted it off. But still, plucking up my spirits as well as I could,

201
and encouraging myself a little, with considering that the
power and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to
protect me; upon this I stepped forward again, and by the
light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I
saw lying on the ground a most monstrous frightful old he-
goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life,
and dying indeed of mere old age.

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he
essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I
thought with myself, he might even lie there; for he had
frighted me so, he would certainly fright any of the savages,
if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there, while
he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was but very small; that is
to say, it might be about twelve foot over, but in no manner
of shape, either round or square, no hands ever having been
employed in making it but those of mere nature. I observed
also, that there was a place at the farther side of it that went
in farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep upon
my hands and knees to go into it, and whither I went, I knew
not; so having no candle, I gave it over for some time, but
resolved to come again the next day, provided with candles
and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for.I made very good candles now
of goat's tallow ); and going into this low place, I was obliged
to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which,

202
by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, consider-
ing that I lmew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond
it. When I was got through the strait, I found the roof rose
higher up, I believe near twenty foot; but never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look
round the sides and roof of this vault or cave. The walls re-
flected an hundred thousand lights to me from my two can-
dles: what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other
precious stones, or gold, which I rather suppose it to be, I
knew not.

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto,
of its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the
floor was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel
upon it; so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature
to be seen; neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or
roof; the only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, how--
ever, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I was really
rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay,
to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about
to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my maga-
zine of powder, and all my spare arms, namely, two fowling-
pieces (for I had three in all) and three muskets (for of them
I had seven in all); so I kept at my castle only five, which
stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost
fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took oc-
casion to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of
the sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the water

203
had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder
on every side, which, caking and growing hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty
pound of very good powder in the centre of the cask; and
this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I car-
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pound
of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any
kind. I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which
are said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; for I persuaded myself while I was here,
if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or if they did, they would not venture to attack
me here.

The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the mouth
of the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I
found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him
in, and cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I in-
terred him there, to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this is-
land, and was so naturalized to the place, and to the manner
of living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down
and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements, which made the time
paSs more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before;
as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and

204
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain,
that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less
than six-and-twenty years: how long he might live afterwards
I know not; though I know they have a notion in the Brasils,
that they live a hundred years; perhaps poor Poll may be
alive there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe to this day; I
wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear him;
but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil. My
dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no
less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old
age; as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to
that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them
at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone,
and after some time continually driving them from me, and
letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into
the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame,
and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned,
and these were part of my family. Besides these, I always
kept two or three household kids about me, which I taught to
feed out of my hand; and I had also more parrots which
talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none
like my first; nor indeed, did I take the pains with any of
them that I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-
fowls, whose names I know not, which I caught upon the
shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes, which I had
planted before my castle wall, being now grown up to a good
thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and
bred there, which was very agreeable to me, so that, as I said

205
above, I began to be very well contented with the life I led,
if it might but have been secured from the dread of the

savages. V.

" ' '"Butit was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for

all people who shall meet with my story to make this just
observation from it, namely, How frequently, in the course of
our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is
oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are

".l fallen into. I could give many examples of this in the course of
1 my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more particularly
' remarkable than in the circumstances of my last two years

of solitary residence in this island.

    

December, as I said above, in
my twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice,
for winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of my
harvest, and required my being pretty much abroad in the

206
fields; when going out pretty early in the morning, even be-
fore it was thorough day-light, I was surprised with seeing
a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of
about two miles, towards the end of the island, where I had
observed some savages had been before; but not on the other
side; but to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stepped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be
surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the at>>
prehensions I had, that if these savages, in rambling over the
island, should find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my
works and improvements, they would immediately conclude
that there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they had found me out. In this extremity I went
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, hav-
ing made all things without look as wild and natural as I
could. '

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture
of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is
to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new forti-
fication, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to
the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
me out of the hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I
continued about two hours, but began to be mighty impatient
for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do
in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer;
so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there

207
was a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had
taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the
ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found
there was no less than nine naked savages sitting round a
small fire they had made; not to warm them, for they had
no need of that, the weather being extreme hot; but, as I
supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human
flesh, which they had brought with them, whether alive or
dead I could not know.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled
up upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed
to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again.
It is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me
into, especially seeing them come on my side the island, and
so near me too; but when I observed their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go
abroad with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they
were not on shore before; and having made this observation,
I went abroad about my harvest work with the more com-
posure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle
as we call it) all away. I should have observed, that for an
hour and more before they went ofl, they went to dancing,
and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my
glasses: I could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but

208
that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering
upon them; but whether they were men or women, that I
could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my
great sword by my side, without a scabbard; and with all
the speed I was able to make, I went away to the hill, where
I had discovered the first appearance of all. And as soon as
I got thither, which was not less than two hours (for I could
not go apace, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived
there had been three canoes more of savages on that place;
and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together,
making over for the main. \___ _.

This was a dreadful sight o.me, especially when going
down to the shore, I could serfe'e marks of horror which the
dismal work they had been about had left behind it, namely,
the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of'human bodies,
eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I began
11 o premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there let them be who or how many soever. /

It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they thus
made to this island were not very frequent; for it was above
fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there
again, that is to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or
signals of them in all that time; and I found they did not come
in the rainy season; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by reason of the constant apprehensions I was in of their com-
ing upon me by surprise.

209
However, I wore out a year and three months more, before
I saw any of the savages; but in the month of May, as near
as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I
had a very strange encounter with them, of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or six-
teen months' interval, was very great. In the day great troubles
overwhelmed my mind; in the night I dreamed often of killing
savages, and the reasons why I might justify the doing of it.
But, to waive all this for a while, it was the middle of May,
on the sixteenth day, I think, that it blew a very great storm
of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder,
and a very foul night it was. I know not what was the particu-
lar occasion of it, but as I was reading the Bible, and taken
up with serious thoughts about my present condition, I was
surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise of quite a different nature
from any I had met with before, for the notions this put into
my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the
greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, clapped up my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the
hill; that moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second
gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute I heard, and
by the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where
I was driven out with the current in my boat.

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in
distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other
ship in company, and fired these guns for signals of distress,
and to obtain help. I had this presence of mind at that minute,

210
as to think, that though I could not help them, it may be they
might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could
get at hand, and making a good sized pile, I set it on fire upon
the hill; the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though the
wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was
certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs
see it, and no doubt they did, for as soon as my fire blazed up,
I heard another gun, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till day broke,
and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw
something at a great distance at sea, full east of the island,
whether a sail, or a hull, I could not distinguish, no, not with
my glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather still
being hazy also: at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived
that it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a
ship at anchor, and being eager, you may be sure, to be satis-
fied, I took my gun in my hand and ran towards the south-
east side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly
carried away with the current, and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly
see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the
night upon these concealed rocks, which I found when I was
out in my boat, and which rocks, as they checked the violence
of the stream, and made a kind of counter stream, or eddy,
were the occasion of my recovering then from the most
desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in.

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruc-
tion; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out of

211
their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water,
had been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing
very hard at E. and E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I
must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought,
have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the
help of their boat; but the firing of their guns for help,
especially when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me
with many thoughts.

In the condition I was in, I could do no more than look
upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them, which had
still this good effect on my side, that it gave me more and more
cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and
comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and
that of two ships' companies, who were now cast away upon
this part of the world, not one life should be spared but
mine. I learnt here again to observe that it isv emare the
providence oPSGod castsmsinto __a_ny_ condition of life so low,
or any misery. so..great _but we may see something to Be
thankful for, and may see others worse than ourselves.

Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could
not so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved;
nothing could make it rational, so much as to wish or expect
that they did not all perish there, except the possibility only
of their being taken up by another ship in company; and
this was but mere possibility indeed; for I saw not the least
signal or appearance of any such thing.

I cannot explain by words, what a strange longing or han--
kering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking
out sometimes thus:-"0 that there had been but one or two,

212
nay, but one soul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to me,
that I might have had one companion, one fellow-creature,
to have spoken to me, and to have conversed with!" In all the
time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a
desire, after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a
regret at the want of it.

  

'HIS WAS NOT to be; either

--' their fate, or mine, or both,

forbade it; for, till the last year of my being in this island, I
never knew whether any were saved out of the ship or no;
and had only the aflliction, some days after, to see the corpse
of a drowned boy washed on shore, at the end of the island
which was next the shipwreck. He had on a seaman's waist-
coat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen
shirt; but nothing to direct me to guess what nation he was of.
He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a
tobacco-pipe. The last was of more value to me than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out
in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some-

 

213
thing on board that might be useful to me; and possibly there

. might be yet some living creature on board, whose life I might
not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own
to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart, that
I could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in
my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's
providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my
mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to my-
self if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity
of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a
bottle of mm (for I had still a great deal of that left), a
basket full of raisins, and thus loading myself with everything
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her,
and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went
home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag full
of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade,
another pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle
of goat's milk, and a cheese; all which, with great labour and
sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying to God to direct
my voyage, I put out; and, rowing or paddling the canoe
along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the island
on that side, namely, N.E. And now I was to launch out into
the ocean, and either to venture or not venture. I looked on
the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the
island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from

214
the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my
heart began to fail me; for I foresaw, that if I was driven into
either of these currents, I should be carried a vast way out to
sea, and perhaps out of reach, or sight, of the island again;
and that, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind
should rise, I should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise, and having hauled my boat into a little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a
little spot of rising ground, very pensive and anxious, be-
tween fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was mus-
ing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood
came on, upon which my going was for so many hours in-
practicable. Upon this it presently occurred to me, that I
should-go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and
observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay
when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another
way home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This
thought was no sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon
a little bill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways,
and from whence I had a clear view of the currents, or sets
of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my re-
turn. Here I found that as the current of the ebb set out close
by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood
set in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had
nothing to do but to keep to the north of the island in my
return, and I should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next mom-

215
ing to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself
for that night in the canoe, under the great watch-coat I men-
tioned, I launched out in the morning. I made first a little
out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the
current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great
rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the southern side current
had done before, and so as to take from me all government
of the boat; but, having a strong steerage with my paddle, I
went directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours, I
came up to it.

It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which by the
building was Spanish, stuck fast jambed in between two rocks;
all the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the
sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run
on with great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short off; but her
bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm.
When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who,
seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I called
him, jumped into the sea to come to me; and I took him into
the boat, and found him almost dead for hunger and thirst.
_ I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat it like a ravenous
wolf that had been starving for a fortnight in the snow. I then
gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I
would have let him, he would have burst himself.

After this I went on board. The first sight I met with was
two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is
indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a

216
storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually over her,' that
the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the
constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been
under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the
ship that had life, or any goods that I could see, but what
were spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the
hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see, but
they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests,
which I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I got
two of them into the boat, without examining what was in
them.

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore part
broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good voyage;
for, by. what I found in these two chests, I had room to sup-
pose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I
may guess by the course she steered, she must have been
bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south
part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havannah, in the
Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much .
difficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a
great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it;
as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them,
but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which
I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper
pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home

217
again; and the same evening, about an hour within night, I
reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last de-
gee.

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I re-
solved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, not to
carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all
my cargo on shore, and began to examine it. The cask of liquor
I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the
Brasils, and, in a word, not at all good. But when I came to
open the chests, I found several things I wanted: for example,
I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind,
and filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good: the bottles
held about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I
found two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so
fastened on top, that the salt water had not hurt them; and
two more of the same, which the water had spoiled. I faund
some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and
abOut a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs, and
coloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome, be-
ing exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face on in a hot dry
day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about
eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in
a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars of gold;
I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little
value; but by the circumstances it must have belonged to the
gunner's mate, though there was no powder in it, but about
two pounds of glazed powder in three small flasks, kept, I sup-

218
pose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the
whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of much use
to me, for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for
it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have
given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stock-
ings, which were things I greatly wanted, for I had not had a
pair on my feet for many years. I had, indeed, gotten two pair
of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two men whom I
found drowned in the wreck; and I found two pair more in
one of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they
were not like our English shoes, either for ease or service,
being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this
seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no
gold; I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other,
which seemed to belong to some oflicer.

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowedor paddled her
along the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and
made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found
everything safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and
for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad
so much: and if any time I did stir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well
satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go with-
out so many precautions, and such a load of arms and am-
munition as I always carried with me, if I went the other way.

One night, in the rainy season, in March, the four-and-

219,-.r-r._ ___

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES

[Wentieth year of my first setting foot in this land of solitari-
ness, I had the following dream; namely, that as I was going
out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the
shore two canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, and that
they brought with them another savage, whom they were go-
ing to kill, in order to eat him, when on a sudden the savage
that they were going to kill, made his escape, and ran for his
life: and then I thought in my sleep, that he came running into
my little grove, before my fortification, to hide himself; and
that I seeing him, and not perceiving that the others saught
him that way, showed myself to him, and encouraged him;
that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray to me to assist
him; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up,
and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant;
and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, "Now
I may venture to the main land, for this fellow will serve me as
\'apilot, and tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro-
visions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what
places to venture into, and what to escape." I awoke with this
thought, and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy
at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disappoint-
ment I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it was no more
than a dream, was really extravagant the other way, and threw
me into a very great dejection of spirits.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that my only
way to go about an attempt for an escape, was to try to get
a savage inmy possession; and, if possible, it should be one
of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring hither to kill.

220
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout, as often as possible, and indeed so often, fill I was
heartily fired of it. I was not at first more careful to shun the
sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, than
I was now eager to be upon them.

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or
three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves
to me, to do what I should direct them, and to prevent their
being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great
while that I pleased myself with this aEair; but nothing still
presented; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for
no savages came near me for a great while.

BOUT A YEAR AND A HALF
after I had entertained these
notions, and by long musing had, as it were, resolved
to put them into execution, I was surprised one mom-
ing early with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore
together, on my side of the island, and the people who be-
longed to them all landed. The number of them broke all my

 

221
measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always
came four, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what
to think of it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty
or thirty men single--handed, so I lay still in my castle, per-
plexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into all the
same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and
was just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise,
at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of
my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two
stages, as usual, standing so, however, that my head did not
appear above the hill; so that they could not perceive me by
any means. I here observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number, that they
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed; how they
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was: but they were all
dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and
figures, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my
perspective glass, two miserable wretches dragged from the
boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them im-
mediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club,
or wooden sword, for that was their way; and two or three
others were at work, cutting him open for their cookery, while
the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should
be ready for him. In that very moment this poor wretch see-
ing himself a little at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes
of life, and he started away from them, and ran with in-

222
credible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me, I
mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation was.

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge,)
when I perceived him to nm my way, and especially when, as
I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole body; and I ex-
pected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would take shelter in my grove: but I could not depend, by
any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, namely, that
the savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there.
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover
when I found that there were not above three men that fol-
lowed him; and still more was I encouraged, when I found
that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained
ground of them, so that if he could but hold out for half an
hour, I saw he would fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which
I mentioned often at the first part of my story, when I landed
my cargoes out of the ship: and this I knew he must necessarily
swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there; but
when the savage who was escaping, came thither, he made
nothing of it, though the tide was then up, but plunging in,
he swam through it in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts,
landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and swiftress.
When the three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two
of them could swim, but the third could not, and that he,
standing on the other side, looked at the others, but went
no further, and soon after went softly back again, which, as it
happened, was very well for him.

I observed that the two who swam were yet twice as long

223
swimming over the creek, as the fellow was that fled from
them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and in-
deed irresistibly, that now was my time to get me a servant,
and perhaps, a companion or assistant, and that I was called
plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I im-
mediately got down the ladders, fetched my two guns, for
they were both at the foot of the ladders, and getting up
again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed to-
wards the sea; and, having a very short cut, and all down
hill, clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and
the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking
back, was at first as much frighted at me, as at them: but
I beckoned with my hand to him to come back, and, in the
meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed;
then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the stock of my piece; I was loath to fire, because I
would not have the rest to hear, though at that distance it
would not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of
the smoke, too, they would not have known what to make of
it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who followed
him, stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced
apace towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived pres-
ently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at
me, so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I
did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen,
and killed (as he thought), yet was so frighted with the noise
and fire of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither
came forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather

.224
inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed again to him,
and made signs to him to come forward, which be easily
understood, and came a little way, then stopped again, and
then a little farther, and stopped again; and then he stood
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encourage-
ment that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of ac-
knowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer. my;

took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him all
I could. But I perceived the savage whom I knocked down
was not killed, but stimned with the blow, and began to come
to himself. So I pointed to him, showing him the savage, that
he was not dead; upon this he spoke some words to me, and
though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were
pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above five-and-
twenty years. But there was no time for such reflections now.
The savage who was knocked down, recovered himself so far
as to sit upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage
began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him; upon this
my savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to
lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side;

225
so I did. He no sooner had it than he ran to his enemy, and,
at one blow, cut oil his head so cleverly, no executioner in
Germany could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw
a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords.
However, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their
wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard,
that they will cut off heads and arms with them, and at one
blow too. When he had done this, he came laughing to me in
sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and laid it
down, with the head of the savage he had killed, just before

me.
He was astonished how I had killed the other Indian, so

far OE; and going to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at
him, turning him, first on one side, then on the other; looked
at the w0und the bullet had made, which was in the breast,
where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had
followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead.
Then he took up his bow and arrows, and came back, and I
beckoned for us to go away, making signs that more might
come after them. Upon this, he signed to me, that he should
bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest,
if they followed; so I made signs for him to do so; he fell to
work, and had them both buried in the sand in about a
quarter of an heur. I then called him away, and took him not
to my castle, but my cave, on the farther part of the island;
so I did not let my dream come to pass in that respect, namely,
that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him
bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water,

226
which he was in great distress for, by his running; and having
refreshed him, I made signs for him to go to sleep, pointing
to a place where I had laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and
a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself some-
times; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years
of age. He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and
surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his
face, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an
European in his countenance too, especially when he smiled.
His hair was long and black, not curled like wool, his forehead
very high and large, and a great vivacity and sparkling sharp-
ness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black, but
very tawny, and yet not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny,
as the Brasilians, and Virginians, and other natives of America
are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though not very easy to describe.
His face was round and plump, his nose small, not flat like the
Negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well
set, and white as ivory. After he had slumbered about half an
hour, he waked, and came out of the cave to me, for I had
been milking the goats in the enclosure just by. When he
espied me, he came nmning, and laid himself on the ground
again, with all the possible signs of an humble, thankful dis-
position, making many antic gestures to show it. At last he
lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, misc};
Wm his head, as_he had done before, and after

this, made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and

227
submission imaginable, to let me know how much he would
serve me as long as he lived. I understood him in many things,
and let him know I was well pleased with him; In a little
time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me;
and first, made him know his name should be Friday, which
was the day I saved his life. I likewise taught him to say,
"Master," and then let him know that was to be my name.
I also taught him to say, "Yes," and "No," and to know the
meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot,
and some bread, and let him see me drink some before him,
and sop my bread in it, which he quickly imitated, and made
signs that it was very good for him.

I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was
day, I took him away with me. As we went by the place where
he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot,
and showed me the marks he had made to find them again,
makingsigns tome .thatwe Should dig them BPAEQaLthem;
at this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of
it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he im-
mediately did, with great submission. I then led him to the
top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone, and pulling
out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
had been, but no appearance of them, or their canoes; so they
were quite gone.

I then took my man Friday with me, giving him the sword
in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I
found he could use very dexterously, making him carry one
gun for me, and I two'for myself, and away we marched to

228
the place where these creatures had been. When I came there,
my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within
me at the horror of the spectacle. Indeed, it was a dreadful
sight; the place was covered with human bones, the ground
dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there,
half eaten, mangled, and scorched, and, in short, all the tokens
of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a
victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and
the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of
other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me
understand, that they brought over four prisoners to feast
upon, that three of them were eaten, and that he, pointing to
himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great battle
between them and their next king, whose subjects it seems
he had been one of, and that they had taken a great number
of prisoners, all of which were carried to several places by
those that had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon
them, as was done here by these wretches.

I caused Friday to gather all the bones and flesh that re-
mained, and lay them together in a heap, and burn them to
ashg, Ifound that he had still a hankering stomach after the
flesh and was still apagnibal in his nature, but I displayed
suchabhgrreice at the very thoughts of it, that .he durst not
discover it; for I let him know that I would kill him if he
oHered itfv

When we had done this, we came back to our castle, where
I gave Friday first of all a pair of linen drawers, which I had
out of the poor gunner's chest I found in the wreck, and
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well; then I

229
made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as I was able; and I
gave him a cap, which I had made of a hare's skin; and thus
he was dressed, for the present, tolerably well; and mighty
well was he pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as
his master. He went awkwardly in these things at first; wear-
ing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of
the jerkin galled his shoulders, and the inside of his arms;
but he soon got used to them.

The next day after I came home to my hut with him, I
began to consider where I should lodge him: so I made a little
tent for him in the vacant place between the two fortifications,
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first; and
as there was an entrance there into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up
in the passage, a little within the entrance, and causing the
door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking
in my ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at me
in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much
noise in getting over, that it must needs awaken me, for my
first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, cover-
ing all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill, which
was again laid across with small sticks instead of laths, and
then thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw, which
was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left
to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door,
which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not
have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great noise. I took care to take all the weapons into my side

every night.

230
But I needed none of these precautions, for never was a
more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullenness, or designs; his very afiections
were tied to me, like those of a child to its father, and, I dare
say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving of my
own, upon any occasion whatever.

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my business
to teach him everything that was proper and useful, and
especially to make him speak, and understand me when I
spoke: and he was a very apt scholarkand he was so merry,
so diligentbagdsopleasgd when he could understand me, or

make? understand himith'a't it was very pleasant for me
to talk to him. And now my life began to be very easy and

FTER I two or
three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday off from his
horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's
stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh. So I took him

231
out with me one morning to the woods, and I saw a she-goat
lying down in the shade, and two young kids close by her.
I catched hold of Friday; "Hold," said I; "stand still;" and
made signs to him not to stir; immediately I presented my
piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor creature who
' had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy,
but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was
sensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked so
amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down. He did not
see the kid I had shot at, nor perceived I had killed it, but
ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded; and,
as I found, thought I was resolved to kill him; for he came
and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a
great many things I did not understand, but I could see that
his meaning was to pray to me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him
no harm; and, taking him up by the hand, laughed at him,
and pointing to the kid I had killed, beckoned to him to nm
and fetch it, which he did; and while he was looking to see
how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by-
and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree within
shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I
called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which was a
parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing
to the parrot and to my gun, and to the ground under the
parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot .and kill that bird; accordingly
I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot
fall. He stood like one frightened again, notwithstanding all I

232
had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, be-
cause he did not see me put anything into the gun; but thought
there must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction
in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any other thing,
near or far 0E; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would
have worshipped me and my gun; as for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after, but
would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him,
which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which
he did, but staid some time, for the parrot, not being quite
dead, was fluttered a good way off from the place where she
fell. However, he found her, took her up, and brought her
to me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun
before, I took this advantage to charge the "gun again, and
not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other
mark, but nothing offered at that time. So I brought home
the kid, and the same evening took the skin 0E, and cut it up
as well as I could; and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled
or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth.
After I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who
seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which
was strangest to him, was to see me eat salt with it. He made
a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat, and putting a
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would
spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water
after it. On the other hand, I took some meat in my mouth

233
without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of
salt, as fast as he had done at it, but it would not do.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the
kid; this I did by hanging it before the fire in a string, as I
had seen many people do in England, setting two poles up,
one on each side of the fire, and one across the top, and tying
the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually.

This Friday admired much; but when he came to taste the
flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him- WW
would never eat man' s flesh any morewhichLmas--vemglad

to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out,

and sifling it Hi the manner I used to do; and he soon under-
stood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread
of; for after that I let him see me make my bread, and bake it
too; and in a little time Friday was able to do all the work
for me as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider that having two mouths to feed in-
stead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do, so I marked
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked very
hard, but very cheerfully; and I told him that it was for corn
to make more bread, because he was now with me, and that I
might have enough for him and myself too. He appeared

234
very sensible of that part, and let me know that he would
work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and
of every place I had occasion to send him to, and talk a great
deal to me; so that, in short, I began to have some use for my
tongue again. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, un-
feigned honesty appeared to be more and more every day, and
I began really to love the creature; and I believe he loved me
as much as possible.

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country; and having learned him English so well
that he could answer me almost any questions, I asked him
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle. At which he smiled, and said, "Yes, yes; we always
fight the better:" that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight: and so we began the following discourse: "You always
fight the better!" said 1; "how came you to be taken prisoner,
then, Friday?"

mom. My nation beat much for all that.

MASTER. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came
you to be taken?

FRIDAY. They more than my nation in the place where me
was: they take one, two, three, and me. My nah'on over-beat
them in yonder place, where me no was; there my nation take
one, two, great thousand.

235
MASTER. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then?

FRIDAY. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go
in the canoe: my nation have no canoe that time.

MASTER. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them,
as these did?

may. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.

MASTER. Where do they carry them?

FRIDAY. Go to other place, where they think.

MASTER. Do they come hither?

FRIDAY. Yes, yes, they come hither: come other else place.

MASTER. Have you been here with them?

FRIDAY. Yes, I been here. (Points to the N .W. side of the
island, which it seems was their side. )

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages, who had used to come on shore on
the farther parts of the island, on the said man-eating occa-
sions that he had been now brought for: and some time after,
when I took courage to carry him to that side, he presently
knew the place, and told me he was there once when they
eat up twenty men, two women, and one child.

After I had had this discourse with him, I asked him how far
it was from our island to the shore; whether the canoes were
not often lost? He told me that there was no danger, no canoes
ever lost; but that, after a little way out to sea, there was a
current, and a wind always one way in the morning, the other
in the afternoon.

This I thought to be no more than the sets of the tide, as

236
going out or coming in'; but I afterwards understood it was
occasioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty
river Oronoque; in the mouth of which river, as I thought
afterwards, our island lay; and that this land, which I per-
ceived to the W. and N .W., was the great island Trinidad, on
the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the
sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he told me all
he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him
the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but
could get no other names than Caribs; from whence I easily
understood that these were the Caribbees, which our maps
place on that part of America which reaches from the mouth
of the river Oronoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me that up a great way beyond the moon, which
must be west from their country, there dwelt white, bearded
men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I men-
tioned before, and that they had killed "much mans," that
was his word. By all which I understood he meant the
Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over
whole countries, and were remembered by all the nations
from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island, and get among those white men? He told me yes, yes,
I might go in "two canoe." I could not understand what he
meantby "two canoe," till at last, with difficulty, I found he
meant that it must be a large boat, as big as two canoes.

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very
well; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one

237
time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape
from this place, and that this poor savage might be a means
to help me to do it.

I was now wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowl-
edge in Friday's mind; particularly I asked him one time who
made him. The poor creature did not understand me, but
thought I had asked him who was his father. But I took it
another way, and asked him who made the sea, the ground
he walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me it was one
old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old; much
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or
the stars. I asked him then, if this person had made all things,
why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence said, "All things said O
to him." I asked him if the people who die in his country
went away anywhere. He said, yes, they all went to Bena-
muckee. Then I asked him whether those they eat up went
thither too. He said, "Yes."

From these thiqgil beggataigsgusthimhthflmsdgdge
W1 told him that the great Maker of all things
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven: that he governs
the world by the same power and providence by which he
had made it: that he was omnipotent, could do everything
for us, give everything to us, take everything from us: and
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus
Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making
our prayers to God, 'and- his being able to hear us, even into

238
heaven. He told me one day, that if our God could hear us up
beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their
Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not
hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt,
to speak to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to
him. He said, no; they never went that were young men; none
went thither but the old men, whom he called their Oowoka-
kee, that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or
clergy; and that they went to say 0 (so he called saying
prayers), and then came back, and told them what Bena--
muckee said. By this I observed that there is priestcraft even
amongst the most blinded ignorant pagans in the world.

Sending him for something a great way off, I seriously
prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct this poor
savage, assisting by his Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant
creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ,
reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to speak so
to him from the word of God, as his conscience might be
convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he
came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him
upon the subject of the redemption of man, by the Saviour
of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from
heaven, namely, of repentance towards God, and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as I could,
why our blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of
angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how, for that reason,
the fallen angels had no share in the redemption, that he
came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the
like.

239
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in all
the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and
must acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same
principle will find, that, in laying things open to him, I really
informed and instructed myself in many things that I either
did not know or had not fully considered before, but which
occurred naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage: and I had more af-
fection in my inquiry after things upon this occasion than
ever I felt before; so that whether this poor wild wretch was
the better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful
that ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me, my
habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure, and
when I reflected, that, in this solitary life which I had been
confined to, I had not only been moved myself to look up to
heaven, and to seek to the hand that brought me thither,
but was now to be made an instrument, under Providence,
to save the life, and for aught I knew, the soul, of a poor
savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and
of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus,
"to know whom is life eternal."

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of
my time, and the conversation which employed the hours
between Friday and me was such as made the three years,
which we lived there together, perfectly and completely
happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be found
in a sublunary state. The savage was now a good Christian,
a much better than I, though I have reason to hope, and
bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and com-

240
forted restored penitents. We had here the word of God to
read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct, than if
we had been in England. I always applied myself to reading
the Scriptures, and to let him know, as well as I could, the
meaning of what I read.

 

. FTER FRIDAY AND I became

more intimately acquainted,

and that he could understand almost all I said to him,

and Speak fluently, though in broken English, to me, I

acquainted him with my history. I let him into the mystery

of gunpowder and bullets, and taught him how to shoot. I

gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with,

and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in

England we wear hangers in, and in the frog, instead of a
hanger, I gave him a hatchet.

I described to him the countries of Europe, and particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we wor-
shipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an account

241
of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him,
as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she had all
been gone long ago.

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I
escaped, and which was now fallen almost to pieces. Upon
seeing this boat, Friday stood musing some time, and said
nothing. I asked him what he studied upon; at last, says he,
"Me see such boat like come to place at my nation."

I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when
I had examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a
boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country
where he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither
by stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some European
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and the
boat might get loose, and drive ashore; but was so dull that
I never once thought of men making their escape from a
wreck thither, much less whence they might come, so I only
inquired after a description of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him when he added, with some
warmth, "We save the white mans from drown." Then I pres-
ently asked him if there were any white mans, as he called
them, in the boat: "Yes," he said, "the boat full of white mans."
I asked him, "How many?" He told me upon his fingers seven-
teen. I asked him "What became of them?" He told me, "They
live, they dwell at my nation."

This put new thoughts into my head again, for I presently
imagined, that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in sight of my island, and who, after the

242
ship was stuck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost,
had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon
that wild shore among savages.

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what was be
come of them; he assured me they still lived there, that they
had been there about four years, that the savages let them
alone, and gave them victuals to live. I asked him, how it
came to pass that they did not ldll them, and eat them. He
said, "No, they make brother with them," that is, as I under-

stood him, a truce; and then he added, "They no eat mans,
but when make the war fight," that is to say, they never eat
any men, but such as come to fight with them, and are taken
inbattle.

It was after this, some considerable time, that being on top
of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence I had,
in a clear day, discovered the main, or continent of America,
Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly
towards the main land, and in a kind of surprise, falls a jump-
ing and dancing, and calls out to me; I asked him what was
the matter. "0 joy," says he, "0 gladl There see my countryl
there my nation!" '

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appear in
his face, his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a
strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own coun-
try again; and this observation of mine put a great many
thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about
my new man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt,
but that if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he

9-43
would not only forget all his religion, but all his obligations
to me. - .

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for
which I was very sorry afterwards; however, as my jealousy
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more cir-
cumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before, in
which I was certainly in the wrong.

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, I was every day pumping
him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts,
which I suspected were in him; but I found everything he
said was honest, and so innocent, that I could find nothing
to nourish my suspicion, and, in spite of all my uneasiness,
he made me at last entirely his own again; nor did he in the
least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not
suspect him of deceit.

One day walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called
to him and said, "Friday, do not you wish yourself in your
own country, your own nation?" "Yes," he said; "I be much
glad to be at my own nation." "What would you do there?"
said I; "would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh again,
and be savage as you were before?" He looked full of con-
cern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no; Friday tell them to
live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat com-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk; no eat man again." "Why, then," said I to
him, "they will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then
said, "No, they no kill me; they willing love learn." He meant
by this they would be willing to learn; he added they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I

z44
asked if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and
told me he could not swim so far. I told him I would make a
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would go with
him. "I go," said I, "why they will eat me if I come there."
"No, no," said he, "me make them no eat you; me make they
much love you." He meant he would tell them how I had
killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make
them much love me.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and
see if I could possibly join with these bearded men, who, I
made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting
but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good company to-
gether, better than I could from an island, forty miles off
the shore, and alone without help. So, after some days I took
Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I
would give him a boat to go back to his own nation; and
accordingly carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of the water, I
brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.

I found he was very dexterous at managing it, and would
make it go almost as swift again as I could; so I said to him,
"Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?" He looked
very dull at my saying so, which, it seems, was because he
thought the boat was too small to go so far. I told him then I
had a bigger; so the very next day I went to the place where
the'first boat lay, which I had made, but which I could not
get into the water. He said that was big enough; but as I
had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-

245
twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me that such a boat would
do very well, and would carry "much enough vittle, drink,
bread ;" that was his way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design
of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we
would go and make one as big as that, and he should go
home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave
and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him. He asked
me again thus,--"Why you angry mad with Friday? What
me done?" I asked him what he meant: I told him I was not
angry with him at all. "No angry! no angry!" says he, repeat-
ing the words several times, "why send Friday home away to
my nation?" "Why," said I, "Friday, did you not say you
wished you were there?" "Yes, yes," says he, "wish we both
there; no wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he
would not think of going there without me. "You shall go
without me; leave me here to live by myself as I did before."
He looked confused at this, and running to one of the hatchets
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it
me. "What must I do with this?" said I to him. "You take
kill Friday," says he. "What must I kill you for?" said I again.
He rehzms very quick W?

'Take kill Friday, noisend Friday_away." As he sgoke, tears
stood PS131.; eyes, and I was so aflected, that I said I would
never send him away,if he was willing to stay with me.

I found that all the foundation of his desire to go to his
own country was laid in his ardent afiection to the people,

and his hopes of my doing them good: a thing, which as I

246
had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or
intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a'strong
inclination to attempting an escape, as above, founded on
the supposition gathered from the former discourse, namely,
that there were seventeen bearded men there; and therefore,
without any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find
out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or
canoe, for the voyage. After searching some time, Friday at
last pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew much better
than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to
this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except
that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between that
and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of
this tree out, to make it into a boat, but I showed him how
rather to cut it out with tools, which after I showed him how
to use he did it very handily, and in about a month's hard
labour we finished it, and made it very handsome, especially
when with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat.
After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get
her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers, into
the water; but when she was in, she would have carried
twenty men with ease.

It amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift
my man Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might venture
over in her. "Yes," he said, "me venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind." However, I had a farther design

247
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a
sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to the mast,
that was easy enough to get, so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which
there was plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to work
to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it; but as to the sail, that was my particular care. I
knew I had pieces of old sails, but as I had had them now
twenty-six years by me, and not being very careful to pre-
serve them, they were nearly all rotten. However, I found
two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with a great
deal of pains and awkward, tedious stitching, for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go
with a boom at the bottom, and a little short sprit at the top,
such as usually our ships' long boats sail with, and such as I
best knew how to manage, because it was such a one as I
used in the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary.

I was near two months in rigging and fitting out my mast
and sails, for I fitted them very complete, making a small
stay, and a sail, or foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn
to windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder
to the stern of her to steer with, andthough I was but a
bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the usefulness and even
necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so much pains
to do it, that at last I brought it to pass.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as
to what belonged to the navigafion of my boat; for though
he knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he lcnew nothing

243
what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and how the sail
gibbed, and filled this way or that way, as the course we
sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one
astonished and amazed. However, with ,a little use, I made
all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that as to the compass I could make him under-
stand very little of that; but there was not much occasion for
the compass in these parts.
. I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the ac-
count, my habitation being quite of another kind than in all
the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing
here with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as
at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first,
I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies
, of the care'of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had
of being effectually and speedily delivered; for I had an in-
vincible impression upon my thoughts, that my deliverance
was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this
place. However, I went on with all my work as usual.

The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I
kept more within doors than at other times; so I had stowed
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into

e creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my
rafts from the ship; and thus we waited for the months of
November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure.

- When the settled season began to come in, the first thing

249
I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being
the store for our voyage; and I intended in a week or a fort-
night's time to open the dock and launch out our boat. I was
busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called
to Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore, and see if he
could find a turtle or tortoise--a thing which we generally
got once a week for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh.
Friday had not been long gone, when he came running back,
and flew over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt
not the ground; and before I had time to speak to him, he
cried out to me, "0 master! 0 master! 0 sorrow! 0 bad!"
"What's the matter, Friday?" said I. "O yonder there," says
he, "one, two, three canoe! one, two, three!" By this way of
speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I found
there were but three. "Well, Friday," said I, "do not be fright-
ened;" so I heartened him up as well as I could. However, I
saw the poor fellow was most terribly-scared,-for nothing ran
in his head but that they were come to look for him, and
would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow
trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I com-
forted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him.
"But," said I, "Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can
you fight, Friday?" "Me shoot," says be; "but there come
many great number." "No matter for that," said I again, "our
guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked him
whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me,
and stand by me, and do just as I bade him. He said, "Me die
when you bid die, master." So I gave him a good dram of rum;

250
and when he had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-
pieces, and load them with swan-shot, as big as small pistol-
bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two
slugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded
with a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.

When I had thus prepared myself I took my perspective
glass, and went up to the side of the hill to see what I could
discover, and I found quickly by my glass that there were
twenty-one savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and
that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant ban-
quet upon these three human bodies; but nothing more than
as I had observed as usual with them.

They were landed, not where they had done when Friday
made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore
was low, and where a thick wood came close almost down to
the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
these wretches came about, so filled me with indignation,
that I came down to Friday, and told him I was resolved to
go down to them and kill them all, and asked him if he would
stand by me. He had now gotten over his fright, and his
spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him,
he was very cheerful, and told me as before, "He would die
when I bid die."

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms which
I had charged, as before, between us. I gave Friday one pistol
to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and
I took one pistol and the other three myself, and in this pos-
ture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my

251
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and
bullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind
me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bade him;
and, in the meantime, not to speak a word. In this posture I
fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might
come within a shot of them before I should be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.

I entered the wood with all possible wariness and silence
(Friday following close at my heels), and marched till I
came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to
them, only that one comer of the wood lay between me and
them. Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great
tree, which was just at the comer of the wood, I bade him
go to the tee, and bring me word if he could see there plainly
what they were doing. He did so, and came immediately
back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there;
that they were all about the fire, eafing the flesh of one of ,
their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand,
a little from them, whom, he said, they would kill next, and
which fired the very soul within me. He told me it was not
one of their own nation, but one of the bearded men whom
he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I
was filled with horror at the very naming the white, bearded
man, and going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and
feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that he was an
European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about

252
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which,
by going a little way about, I saw I might come at undis-
covered, and that then I should be within half a shot of them.
So I withheld my passion, and, going back about twenty
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little rising
ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the distance
of about eighty yards.

    

HAD now not a moment to
, lose, for nineteen of the dread-
ful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled to-
gether, and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor
Christian, and bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire,
and they were stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I
turned to Friday: "Now, Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee."
Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," said I, "do exactly
as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the
muskets and the fowling--piece upon the ground, and Friday

253
did the like by his; and with the other musket I took my aim
at the savages, bidding him do the like: then asking him if he
was ready, he said, "Yes." "Then fire at them," said I, and
the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much the better than I, that on the
side he shot he killed two of them and wounded three more;
and, on my side, I killed one and wounded two. They were
in a dreadful consternation; and all of them who were not
hurt jumped up upon their feet immediately, but did not
know which way to run or which way to look, for they knew
not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes
close upon me, that, as I bid him, he might observe what I
did; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the
piece and took up the fowling--piece, and Friday did the like:
he sees me cock and present; he did the same again. "Are
you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," said he. "Let fly, then,"
said I; and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches,
and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaded with
what I call swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we found only
two drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran about
yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody and
wounded most of them, and three more fell quickly after,
but not quite dead.

"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged pieces
and taking up the musket, which was yet loaded, "follow me,"
which he did with a deal of courage; upon which I rushed
out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud
as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as fast as

254
I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, I made directly
towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the
beach or shore, between the place where they sat and the sea.
The two butchers, who were just going to work with him,
had left him at the surprise of our first fire and fled, in a
terrible fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe,
and three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to
Friday, and bade him step forwards and fire at them. He
understood me immediately, and, running about forty yards
to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he had
killed them all, for I saw them all fall on a heap in the boat,
though I saw two of them up again quickly. However, he
killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay
in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.

While Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut
the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands
and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him, in'the Portuguese
tongue, what he was. He answered in Latin, "Christianus;"
but was so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak.
I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him, making
signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a
piece of bread, which he eat. Then I asked him what country-
man he was, and he said, "Espag'niole;" and, being a little
recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly
make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. I
said, in as good Spanish as I could, "We will talk afterwards,
but we must fight now; if you have any strength left, take
the pistol and sword and lay about you." He took them very
thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but,

255
as if they put new vigour into him, he flew upon his mur-
derers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an
instant, for they were so surprised and frightened, that they
could make no resistance, nor attempt to escape.

Ikept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being will-
ing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Span--
iard my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade
him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch
the arms which lay there that had been discharged, which
he quickly did; and then giving him my musket, I sat down
to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when
they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there hap-
pened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of
the savages, who made at him with one of their great wooden
swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him before,
if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was very bold,
though weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had
cut him two great wounds on his head; but the savage, being
a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him
down, and was wringing my sword out of his hand, when
the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitted the sword,
drew the pistol from his girdle, and shot him dead on the
spot.

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursuedlthe flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and
with that he dispatched those three who were wounded at
first and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the
fowling-pieces, With which he pursued two of the savages,

256
and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run, they
both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,
and killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for
him; and though he was wounded, yet had plunged into the
sea, and swam with all his might off to those who were left
in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with one wounded,
we know not whether he died or no, were all that escaped
our hands of one-and-twenty.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of
gun-shot; and though Friday made two or three shots at them,
I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain
have had me take one of their canoes and pursue them, and
indeed I was very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying
the news home to their people, they should come back, per-
haps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour
us by mere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea;
and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I was sur-
prised to find another poor creature lie there alive, bound
hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and
almost dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was, for
he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat; he
was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long,
that he had little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, that bound
him, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand
or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems,
still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When
Friday came, I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his

257
deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him give the
poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being de-
livered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when
Friday came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears to have seen how Friday
kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his own face and head, and then
sung and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell
me what was the matter; but when he came a little to himself,
he said that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me, to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor sav-
age, at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered
from death: nor indeed can I describe half the extravagance
of his afiection after this, for he went into the boat and out of
the boat a great many times. When he went in to him, he
would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to his bosom half an hour together, to nourish it;
then he took his arms and ancles, which were numbed and
stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his
hands; and I perceiving what the case was, gave him some
rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a
deal of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight;
and it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard
within two hours after, and before they could be gotten a

258
quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all night,
and that from the north-west, which was against them, that
I could not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever
reached to their own Coast.

But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some
time; but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased
to the highest extreme. Then I asked him if he had given his
father any bread. He shook his head, and said, "None: ugly
dog eat all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread, out of a
little pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for
himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins,
so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He had no
sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out
of the boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitched. He
ran at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of his foot
that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was out
of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called and
hallooed too after him, it was all one: away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came near I found his pace
was slacker, because he had something in his hand.

When he came to me, I found he had been quite home for
an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water,
and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread. The
' bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father;
however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it.

259
.The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits
I had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was any water left; he said, "Yes," and I bade him giveit to
the ,poor Spaniard, who was as. much in want of it as his
father, and I sent one of the cakes that Friday brought to the
Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that,
upon Friday's coming up to him with the water, he sat up
and drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went up
to him and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness
that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not-
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he
could nOt stand upon his feet. He tried to do it two or three
times, but was really not able, his ancles were so swelled and
'so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to
rub his ancles, and bathe them with mm, as he had done
his father's.

" I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two min-
utes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his
head about to see for his father; and at last he missed him,
at which he started up, and without speaking a word, flew
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when he came,
he found he had only laid himself down to ease his limbs.
So Friday came back to me presently, and I then told him to

260
help the Spaniard to the boat; so he took him upon his back,
and carried him beside his father in the boat, and stepping
out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the
shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and
leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe.
As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he
went. He told me, "Go fetch more boat." So away he went,
like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him; and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got
to it by land: so he wafted me over, and then went to help
our new guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were
neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not
what to do.

At last, we made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on,
and Friday and I carried them up both together upon it be-
tween us. But when we got them to the outside of our wall,
or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it
was impossible to get them over; and I was resolved not to
break it down. So I set to work again; and Friday and I, in
about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered
with old sails, and above with boughs of trees, being in the
same space without our outward fence, and between that and
the grove of young wood which I had planted; and here we
made them two beds of such things as I had, namely, of good
rice straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another
to cover them on each hed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very
rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection which I fre-

261
quently made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole
country was my own mere property, so that I had an un-
doubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were per-
fectly subjected; I was the absolute lord and law.giver: they
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down their
lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. It was remark-
able, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three
diiferent religions: my man Friday was a Protestant; his
father wasa pagan and a cannibal; and the Spaniard was a
Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience to all my
subjects.

As soon as I had seemed my two weak, rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I
began to think of making some provision for them; and the
first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat,
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed. Then I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them a very good dish of flesh and broth, and we
all enjoyed it and eat heartily.

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday
to take one of the canoes and go and fetch our muskets and
other fire-arms from the place of battle; and the next day I
ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages,
which lay open to the sun, and would presently be offensive;
and I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast: all of which he punctually performed.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my
two new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire of his father

262
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe,
and whether we might expect a return of them with a power
too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that
night they went OE, but must be drowned, or driven south to
those other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured
as they were to be drowned, if they were cast away; but as
to what they would do, if they came on shore, he said, he
knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise
and the fire, that he believed they would tell their people
they were all killed by thunder and lightning, and not by
the hand of man; and that the two which appeared (namely
Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits and furies come down
to destroy them, and not with weapons. And this old savage
was right; for though they escaped the sea, they gave such
dreadful accounts in their own country (as I heard after-
wards), that they never ventured from that part to my island
again.

But I was under continual apprehensions for some time,
and kept upon my guard, I and all my army; for, as we were
now four of us, I would have ventured upon a hundred of
them, in the open field.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the
fear of them coming wore OE, and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration, being
likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend
upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would

go.
263
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a
serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portu-
guese, who having been cast away, and made their escape
to that side, lived there at peace indeed with the savages,
but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for
life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to
the Havannah, being directed to leave their loading there,
which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what
European goods they could meet with there; that they had
five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of
another wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when
first their ship was lost; and that these escaped through in-
finite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on
the cannibal wast, where they expected to be devoured
every moment.

He told me they had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for they had neither powder nor ball, the
washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a
little, which they used at their first landing to provide them-
selves some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there,
and if they had formed no design of making an escape. He
said they had many consultations about it, but having neither
vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind,
their counsels always ended in tears and despair. I asked
him how he thought they would receive a proposal from me,

264
which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they
were all here, it might not be done.

He told me they were all under the greatest distress im-
aginable, and if I would undertake their relief, they would
live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and the Spaniard
over to them to treat. But when he had gotten all things in
readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection,
which had so much prudence in it on the one hand, and so
much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliver-
ance of his comrades for at least half-a-year. The case was
thus:--He had been with us now about a month, during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had provided,
with the assistance of Providence, for my support; and he
saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up,
which, as it was more than sufficient for myself, so it was
not sufficient, at least without good husbandry, for my family,
now it was increased to the number of four; but much less
would it be sufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he
said, fourteen, still alive, should come over; and, least of all,
would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build
one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America.
So he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let
him and the two others dig and cultivate more land, as much
as I could spare seed to sow; and that we should wait another
harvest, then we might have a supply of corn for his coun-
trymen, when they should come; for want might be a tempta-

. 265
tion to them to disagree, or not think themselves delivered,
otherwise than out of one difficulty into another.

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good,
that I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal,
as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell to digging,
all'fbur of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed time, we had gotten as much land cured,
and trimmed up, as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley
on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed
we had to spare.

Having now society enough, and our number being suffi-
cient to put us out of fear of savages, if they had come,
unless their number had been very great, we went freely all
over the island, wherever we found occasion; and as we had
our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible,
at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. To this
purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for
our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting them
down; and then I caused the Spaniard to oversee and direct
their work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains I
had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them
to do the like, till they had made about a dozen large planks
of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious labour
it took up, any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of
tame goats as much as I could; and to this purpose I made
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with

266 .
Friday the next day, for we took our turns; and, by this means,
we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest;
for, whenever we shot the dam we saved the kids, and added
them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing the
grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be
hung up in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant,
where raisins are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty
barrels; and these with our bread, was a great part of our
food.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island; but, how-
ever, it was enough to answer our end, for, from our twenty-
two bushels of barley, we brought in and thrashed out above
two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion
of the rice, which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the fourteen Spaniards had been on shore
with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would
very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us
to any part of the world, that is to say, of America. When we
had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell
to work to make more wicker-work, namely, great baskets in
which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I
expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main,
to see what he could do with those he had left behind him
there. I gave him strict charge not to bring any man with
him who would not first swear, in the presence of himself
and the old savage, that he would in no way injure, fight with,

267
or attack the person he should find in the island, who was so
kind as to send for them, in order to their deliverance; but
that they would stand by and defend him against all such
attempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under
and subjected to his command: and that this should be put
in writing, and signed with their hands.

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage
went away in one of the canoes which they came in, when
they were brought as prisoners to be devoured by the sav-
ages. I gave each of them a musket, and about eight charges
of powder and ball, charging them to be very careful of both,
and not to use either of them, but upon very urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread and of dried
grapes, suflicient for themselves for many days, and suflicient
for all their countrymen for about eight days; and wishing
them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them about
a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I
should know them again, when they came back, at a dis-
tance before they came on shore.

They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that the
moon was at the full, by my account, in the month of October,
as near as I could tell.

It was no less than eight days I waited for them, when a
strange and unforeseen occurrence intervened, of which, the
like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast
asleep in my but one morning, when my man Friday came
running in to me, and called aloud, "Master, master, they

268
are come, they are come!" I jumped up, and, regardless of
danger, went out, as soon as I could get my clothes on,
through my little grove; I went without my arms, which it
is not my custom to do; but I was surprised, when, turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat, at about a league and
a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-
mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair
to bring them in. Also, I observed, that they did not come
from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southern-
most end of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bade
him lie close, for these were not the people we looked for,
and that we did not know yet whether they were friends or
enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and, having taken
the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used
to do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my
view plainer, without being discovered. I had scarce set my
foot on the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying
at anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from me,
S.S.E., but not above a league and a half from the shore. It
appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat an Eng-
lish long boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of
seeing a ship, and one which I had reason to believe was
manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends,
was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret
doubts hanging about me, I cannot tell from whence they
came, bidding me to be on my guard. I began to consider
what business an English ship could have here; since it was

269
not the way to or from any part of the world where the
English had any trafiic; and I knew there had been no storm
to drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they were
English really, it was probable they were here upon no good
design, and that I had better continue as I was than fall into
the hands of thieves and murderers.

I had not kept myself long in this posture, when I saw the
boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to
thrust in at, for the convenience of landing: however, as
they did not come quite far enough, they did not see the
little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but run their
boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very happy for me; for, otherwise, they would
have landed just, as I may say, at my door, and would soon
have beaten me out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plun-
dered me of all I had.

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were
Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought
were Dutch, but it did not prove so. There were, in all, eleven
men, whereof three I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped
on shore, they took these three out of the boat as prisoners.
One of the three I could perceive using the most passionate
gestures of entreaty, afiliction, and despair; the other two
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned in-
deed, but not so much as the first.

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what
the meaning of it could be. Friday called out to me, in Eng-
lish, as well as he could, "0 master, you see English mans eat

27o
prisoners as well as savage mans." "Why," said I, "do you
think they are going to eat them, then?" "Yes," says Friday,
"they will eat them." "No, no," said I, "Friday, I am afraid
they will murder them, indeed, but you may be sure they
will not eat them."

All this while I had no thoughts of what the matter really
was, but expected every moment the three prisoners would
be killed; and once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm,
with a great cutlass or sword, to strike one of the poor men,
and I expected to see him fall every moment. I wished heartily
now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him;
or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within
shot of them, that I might have rescued the three men, for
they had no fire-arms that I saw.

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three
men by the insolent seamen, I saw that the fellows ran scatter-
ing about the land, as if they wanted to see the country. I
observed, also, that the three other men had liberty to go
where they pleased, but that they sat down all three upon
the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.

2714' 'Ve'av <<se-- T WAS just at the top of high

water when these people came
on shore, and while partly they stood parleying with the
prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled
about to see what kind of place they were in, they had care--
lessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed
considerably away, leaving the boat aground. They had left
two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drank
a little too much brandy, fell asleep. However, one of them
wakening sooner than the other, and finding the boat too
fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest, who were
straggling about, upon which they all soon came to the boat,
but it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being
very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft, oozy
sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true
seamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to
forethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about
the country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to an-
other (ealling them off from the boat), "Why, let her alone,

272Jack, can't yel She'll float next tide." By which I was fully
confirmed what countrymen they were.

All this while I kept myself close, not once daring to stir
out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation
near the top of the hill. I knew it would be no less than ten
hours before the boat muld be afloat again, and by that time
it would be dark, and I might be more at liberty to see their
motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any.

In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another
kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also to
load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling--pieces, and
I gave him three muskets. My figure indeed was very fierce;
I had my formidable goat-sldn coat on, with the great cap I
have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my
belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said before, not tohave made any
attempt until it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the
heat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling
into the woods, and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep.
The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition
to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as
I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition. Immediately I marched with
my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-fike
figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could,

273
and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them,
in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?"

They started up at the noise, but were ten times more con-
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure I made.
They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them
just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English:--
"Gentlemen," said I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you do not expect it." "He
must be sent directly from heaven, then," said one of them
very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time,
"for our condition is past the help of man." "All help is from
heaven, sir," said I, "but can you put a stranger in the way how
to help you, for you seem to be in some great distress? I saw
you when you landed; and when you seemed to make applica-
tion to the brutes that came with you, I saw one lift up his
sword to kill you."

The poor man, with tears nmning down his face, and trem-
bling, looking like one astonished, returned, "Am I talking
to God or man? Is it a real man, or an angel?" "Be in no fear
about that, sir," said I, "if God had sent an angel to relieve
you, he would have come better clothed, and armed after
another manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your fears,
I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you, you
see. I have one servant only: we have arms and ammunition,
tell us freely, can we serve you? What is your case?"

"Our case, sir," said he, "is too long to tell you, while our
murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I was commander of
that ship, my men have mutinied against me, they have been
hardly prevailed upon not to murder me, and, at last, have

274
set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex-
pected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and
know not yet what to think of it."

"Where are those brutes, your enemies?" said I, "do you
know where they are gone?" "There they are, sir," said he,
pointing to a thicket of trees, "my heart trembles for fear
they have seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, they
will murder us all."

'Have they any fire-arms?" said I. He answered, "They had
only two pieces, and one which they left in the boat." "Well,
then," said I, "leave the rest to me. I see they are asleep. It
is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them
prisoners?" He told me there were two desperate villains
among them, that was scarce safe to show any mercy to, but
if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return
to their duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he
could not, at that distance, describe them; but he would obey
my orders in anything I would direct. "Well," said I, "let us
retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we
will resolve farther." So they willingly went back with me, till
the woods covered us from them. "Look you, sir," said I, "if
I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing to make two
conditions with me?" He anticipated my proposals, by tell-
ing me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be
wholly directed and commanded by me in everything; and
if the ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me,
in what part of the world soever I would send him, and the
two others said the same.

275
'Well," said I, "my conditions are but two; first, that while
you stay on this island with me, you will not pretend to any
authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will,
upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice
to me or mine, upon this island; and, in the meantime, be
governed by my orders. Secondly, that if the ship is, or may
be, recovered, you will carry me and my man to England
passage free." He gave me all the assurances that the inven-
tion and faith of man could devise, that he would comply with
these most reasonable demands, and, besides, would owe his
life to me, and acknowledge it, upon all occasions, as long as
he lived.

"Well, then," said I, "here are three muskets for you, with
powder and ball. Tell me next what you think is proper to
be done." He showed all the testimony of his gratitude that
he was able; but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told
him I thought it was hard venturing anything, but the best
method I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as
they lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly
upon God's providence to direct the shot.

He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he
could help it, but that those two were incorrigible villains,
and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and
if they escaped we should be undone still, for they would go
on board and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy
us all. "Well, then," said I, "necessity legitimates my advice;
for it is the only way to save our lives." However, seeing him

276
still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go
themselves, and manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him if either of them were the men who, he had said,
were the heads of the mutiny. He said, "No." "Well, then,"
said I, "you may let them escape; and Providence seems to
have awakened them on purpose to save themselves." "Now,"
said I, "if the rest escape you, it is your fault."

, Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in
his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with
him, each man a piece in his hand. The two men who were
with him, going first, made some noise, at which one of the
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing them com-
ing, cried out to the rest; but it was too late then, for the
moment he cried out, the two men fired, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at
the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot,
and the other very much wounded; but, not being dead, he
started up upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the
other; but the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too
late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his
villainy, and, with that word, knocked him down with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more. There were
three more in the company, and one of them was also slightly
wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw their
danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for
mercy. The captain told them he would spare their lives, if
they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence of

277
the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to
be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in
carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They
gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be
desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him to keep
them bound, hand and foot, while they were upon the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the captain's
mate, to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away
the oars and sail, which they did; and, by the bye, three
straggling men, that were parted from the rest, came back
again upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their captain,
who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they sub-
mitted to be bound also.

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire
into one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him
my whole history, which he heard with an attention even to
amazement, and particularly at the wonderful manner of my
being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed,
as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him
deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon himself,
and how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose
to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not
speak a word more.

After this communication was at an end, I carried him and
his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, namely, at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as I had, and showed them all

278
the contrivances I had made during my long inhabiting this
place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amaz~
ing; but, above all, the captain admired my fortification, and
how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of
trees, which, having been now planted near twenty years,
and the trees growing much faster than in England, was be-
come a little wood, and so thick it was impassable in any
part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little
winding passage into it. This I told him was my castle and
my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most
princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would show him that too another time; but at present our
business was to mnsider how to recover the ship. He agreed
with me as to that; but told me he was perfectly at a loss
what measures to take, for that there were still six-and-twenty
hands on board, who, having entered into a'cursed conspir-
acy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,
would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced they should
be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England,
or to any of the English colonies, and that therefore there
would be no attacking them with so small a number as we
were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found
it was a very rational conclusion; and it occurred to me, that,
in a little while, the ship's crew, wondering what had become
of their comrades, and of the boat, would certamly come on
shore, in their other boat, to see for them, and that then,

279
perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us:
this, he allowed, was rational.

Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might
not carry her off: and taking everything out of her, leave her
so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out of her,
and whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy, and another of mm, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of
powder, and a great lump of sugar, in a piece of canvas; the
sugar was five or six pounds: all which was very welcome to
me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had been
without many years.

When we had carried all these things on shore, we knocked
a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough
to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.

Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be
capable to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, I did not much question to make
her fit again to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and
call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first,
by main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high
that the tide would not float her OR at high-water mark; and,
besides, had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should do, we
heard the ship fire a gun; and saw her make a waft with her
ancient, as a signal for the boat to come on board; but no

280
boat stirred, and they fired several times, making other sig-
nals for the boat.

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless,
and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the
help of my glasses) hoist another boat 0E, and row towards
the shore; and we found, as they approached, that there were
no less than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms with
them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had
a full view of them as they came. The captain knew the per-
sons and characters of. all the men in the boat, of whom he
said that there were three very honest fellows, who, he was
sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frightened: but that as for the boatswain, who,
it seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the rest,
they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were,
no doubt, made desperate in their new enterprise.

We had, upon the first appearance of the boats' coming
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and
had indeed secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom
the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday,
and one of the. three delivered men, to my cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods. They
left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised
them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their
liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their es-
cape, they should be put to death without mercy. They prom-
ised faitbquy to bear their confinement with patience.

281
- The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were
kept pinioned indeed, because the captain did not like to trust
them, but the other two were taken in to my service, upon
their captain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly en-
gaging to live and die with us.

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay,
they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore,
hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for
I was afraid they would rather have left the boat and anchor,
some distance from the shore, with some hands in her to
guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat.

Being on shore, they ran all to the other boat; and it was
easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her
stripped, and a great hole in the bottom. After this, they set
up a great shout; but it was all to no purpose: then they
came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms,
which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring,
but it was all one; those in the cave we were sure cauld not
hear, and those in our keeping, though they heard it well
enough, yet durst give no answer to them.

, They were so surprised at this, as they told us afterwards,
that they resolved to go all on board again to their ship, and
let them know there that the men were all murdered, and
the long boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched
their boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and
set sail, giving their comrades up for lost, and so he should
still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have re-

282
covered, but he was quickly as much frightened the other
way.

They had not been long put oil with the boat, but we
perceived them all coming on shore again; and they left three
men in the boat, and the rest went up into the country to
look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us,
for now we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let
the boat escape, because they would then row away to the
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh, and
set sail, and so our hope of recovering the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the
issue of things might present. The seven men came on shore,
and the three who remained in the boat put her OR to a good
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor, to wait for
them, so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the
boat. '

Those that came on shore kept close together, marching
towards the top of the little hill, under which my habitation
lay, and we could see them plainly, though they cauld not
perceive us. And when they were come to the brow of the
hill, where they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods which lay towards the north-east part, and where the
island lay lowest, they shouted till they were weary, and
then they sat down to consider of it. Had they gone to sleep
there, as the other party did, they had done for us; but they
were too full of apprehension of danger to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this

283
consultation of theirs, namely, that perhaps they would all
fire a volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear,
and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture
when their pieces were all discharged, and they would cer-
tainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.
I liked the proposal, provided it was done while we were
near enough to come up to them before they could load their
pieces again.

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time,
very irresolute what course to take; at length I told them there
would be nothing to be done, in my opinion, till night: and
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might
use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on
shore.

We waited a great while, and were very uneasy; when, we
saw them all start up, and march towards the sea. It seems
they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the dan-
ger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on their
intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I im-
agined that they had given over their search, and were for
going back again; and the captain was ready to sink when
I told him my thoughts, but I presently thought of a sh'atagem
to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to
a tittle.

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate, to go over the
little creek westward, towards the place where Friday was
rescued, and at about half a mile distance, I bade them hal-

284
100 as loud as they could, and as soon as they heard the
seamen answer them, they should return it again, and then,
keeping out of sight, take a round, and then wheel about again
to me by such ways as I directed.

They were just going into the boat, when Friday and the
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answer-
ing, run along the shore westward, towards the voice they
heard, when they were stopped by the creek, the water being
up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to come
and set them over, as, indeed, I expected. '

When they had set themselves over, I observed that they
took one of the three men out of her, and left only two in the
boat, having fastened her to a stump of a little tree on the
shore.

This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Fri-
day and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest
with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we sur-
prised the two men before they were aware, one of them
lying on the shore between sleeping and waking, and, going
to start up, the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him
and knocked him down, and then called to him in the boat
to yield or he was a dead man.

There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one of the three
men who were not so beauty in the mutiny as the rest of the
crew, and, therefore, was easily persuaded not only to yield,
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.

In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so well

285
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them,
by hallooing and answering, from one wood to another, till
they not only heartily tired them, but left them where they
were sure they could not reach back before it was dark: and
indeed they were heartily fired themselves also by the time
they came back to us.

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before
they came back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost
of them long before they came quite up, calling to those he-
hind to come along, and could hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come
any faster, which was very welcome news to us.

At length they came up to the boat, but it is impossible to
express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground
in the creek, and their two men gone; we could hear them
telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits in it, and
they should be carried away and devoured.

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by
their names, but got no answer. After some time, we could
see them by the little light there was run about like men in
despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down in
the boat to rest themselves, then come on shore again, and
walk about, and so the same thing over again.

My men would have fallen upon them in the dark, but I
was willing to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could,
being unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men, know-
ing the others were well armed. I resolved to wait and make

286
sure of them, and drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered
Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and knees,
and get as near them as they possibly could before they
offered to fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader, and had now shown
himself the most dispirited of all the rest, walked towards
them with two more of their crew. The captain was so eager
at having the principal rogue so much in his power, that he
could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to be
sure of him, for he only heard his tongue before; but when
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on
their feet, let fly at them.

The boatswain was killed on the spot, the next was shot
through the body, and fell just by him, though he did not
die till an hour or two after, and the third ran for it.

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men, namely, myself,
generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and
his two men; and the three prisoners of war, whom we had
trusted with arms.

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they could
not see our number; and I made the man they had left in the
boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if
he could bring them to parley, which fell out just as we
desired. So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them,
"Tom Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered immediately,
"Who's that, Robinson?" for it seems he knew his voice. The
other answered, "Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw

287
down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this mo.
mentl"

"Who must we yield to?--where are they?" says Tom Smith
again. "Here they are," says be. "Here is our captain, and
fifty men with him, have been hunting you this two hours. The
boatswain is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner;
if you do not yield, you are all lost."

"Will they give us quarter, then," says Tom Smith, "and
we will yield." "I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield," says
Robinson. So he asked the captain, and the captain himself
then called out, "You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay
down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall all have
your lives, all but Will Atkins."

    

 

--- r ,
>> . ' v PON THIS Will Atkins cried

" " ._--------==--- out, "For God's sake, captain,
give me quarter] What have I done? They have all been as
bad as I!" which was not true, for it seems this Will Atkins
was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they

first mutinied. H0wever, the captain told him he must lay

 

 

288
down his arms at discretion, and trust to the govemor's mercy;
by which he meant me, for they called me governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged their _
lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and
two more, who bound them all; and then my great army of
fifty men, which, particularly with those three, were in all
but eight, came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of sight, for
reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seiz-
ing the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to
parley with them he expostulated with them upon the villainy
of their practices with him, and how certame it must bring
them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows.

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that, he told them that the governor was an
Englishman, and that he might hang them all there if he
pleased; but, as he had given them quarter, he supposed he
would send them to England, except Atldns, whom he was
commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death,
for that he would be hanged in the morning. Though this
was all a fiction of his own, yet it had the desired effect;
Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede
with the governor for his life, and all the rest begged of him,
for God's sake, not to be sent to England.

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship. So

289
I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see what
kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to me.
When I called, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and to say to the captain, "Captain,
the. commander calls for you;" and presently the captain re-
plied, "Tell his excellency I am just a-eoming." So they all
believed the commander was just by, with his fifty men.

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project
for seizing the ship, which pleased him, and resolved to put
it in execution the next morning.

But in order to execute it with more art, and to be sure of
success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he
should go and take Atkins and two more of the worse of them,
and send them bound to the cave where the others lay. So
Friday, and the two men who came on shore with the captain,
conveyed them to the cave as to a prison. The other I ordered
to my bower, where they were pinioned, and left secure
enough.

.To these, in the morning, I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, 'and
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or no, to
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the
injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and
that though the governor had given them quarter for their
lives, as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to
England, they would all be hanged in chains; but that if
they would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship,
he would have the govemor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be

290
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with deep imprecations,
that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that
they should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all
over the world; that they would owe him for a father to them
as long as they lived. "Well," says the captain, "I must go and
tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an account of
the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed they
would be faithful. However, that we might be very secure, I
told him he should go back again, and choose out five of
them, and tell them that they should see he did not want
men, but that he would take out those five to be his assistants,
and that the governor would keep the other two, and the
three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as
hostages for the fidelity of those five; and if they proved un-
faithful in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged
' in chains alive upon the shore.

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor
was in earnest. However, they had no way left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as
much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their
duty. Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:
--First, the captain, his mate, and passenger. Sewnd, then,
the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their
characters from the captain, I had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms. Third, the other two, whom I had
kept in my bower, pinioned, these were now released. Fourth,
these five, released at last; so that there were twelve in all,

291
besides five we kept in the cave, as hostages for the fidelity
of the others.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with those'
hands on board the ship; for as for me and my man Friday,
I did not think it proper for us to stir, having seven men
left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep
them asunder, and supply them with victuals.

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but
Friday went twice a day to them, to supply them with nec-
essaries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a cer-
tain distance, where Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's
pleasure they should not stir anywhere, but by my direction;
that if they did, they should be fetched to the castle and
be' laid in irons; so that we never suEered them to see me as
governor, so now I appeared as another person, and spoke of
the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all
occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made
his passenger, captain of one, with four other men: he him-
self, with his mate, and five more, went in the other. And
they contrived their business very well; for they came up to
the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within call
of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them he
had brought OR the men and the boat, but that it was a long
time before they had found them, and the like; holding them

292
in chat till they came to the ship's side; when the captain
and the mate, entering first with their arms, immediately
knocked down the second mate and the carpenter with the
butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded
by their men. They secured all the rest that were upon the
main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches to
keep them down who were below, when the other boat, and
their men entering the forechains, secured the forecastle of
the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room,

making three men they found there prisoners. When this was
done, and all safe upon the deck, the captain ordered the
mate with three men to break into the round-house, where
the new rebel captain lay; and be, having taken the alarm,
and gotten up, now stood with two men and a boy, having
fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate, with a crow,
split open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-ball,
which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men,
but killed nobody.

' The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-
house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new
captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth,
and came out again behind one of his ears, so that he never
spoke a word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was
taken eEectually, without any more lives lost. As soon as the
ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be
fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me, to give me
notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I was glad to

293
hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till two o'clock
inthe morning.

Having heard the signal plainly, I laid me down, and being
very much fatigued, I fell sound asleep, when shortly I was
awoke by the noise of a gun; and, starting up, I heard a man
call me by the name of "Governor," and presently I knew
the captain's voice, when climbing up to the top of the hill,
there he stood, and pointing to the ship, be embraced me in
his arms. "My dear friend and deliverer," says he, "there's
your ship; for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that
belongs to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode,
about half a mile off the shore, for they had weighed her
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek, and the tide being up, they had
brought the pinnace in near the place where I first landed
my rafts, and so landed just at my door.

Wfiady to sink down with surprise, for I saw
my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all things
easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I
pleased to go. He perceived my situation, and immediately
pulls a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial,
which he had brought on purpose for me. After I drank it,
I sat down upon the ground, and it was a good while before
I could speak to him.

After some time, I came to myself, and then I embraced
him in my turn, as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together.
I told him, I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a

294
chain of wonders; and such things as these were the testi-
monies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing
the world, and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite power
could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send
help to the miserable whenever he pleased; nor did I forget
to return thanks to God for all his mercies.

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship aflorded,
and such as the wretches, who had been so long his masters,
had not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to his
men, and told them to bring the things ashore that were for
governor: and it was a splendid present. First, he had brought
me a case of bottles full of cordial waters, six large bottles of
Madeira wine, two pounds of excellent tobacw, twelve good
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag
of peas, and about a hundredweight of biscuit. He brought
me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and
two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things. But,
besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful to
me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck-
cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own,
which had been worn very little; but the clothes felt very
awkward and uneasy upon me at first. .

After all these things were brought into my little apart-
ment, we began to consult what was to be done with the
prisoners we had, and whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to
be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree, and the cap-

295
tain said he knew that they were such rogues, that there was
no obliging them; and if he did carry them away, it must be
in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice, at the
first English colony he could come at. Upon this, I told him I
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it
their own request that he shouldleflethem upon the island,
of w c the captain said he should be very glad. I accord-
ingly sent for them, and entered seriously into discourse with
them upon their circumstances. One of them answered in the
name of the rest, that they had nothing to say but this, that
when they were taken, the captain promised them their lives,
and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew
not what mercy to show them; for, as for myself, I had resolved
to quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage
with the captain to go to England; and as for the captain,
he would not carry them to England, but as prisoners in irons,
to be tried for mutiny and running away with ship; the
consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the
gallows: so that I could not tell which was best for them, unless
they had a mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired
that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it; I had some
inclination to give them their lives, if they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it; and said they would
rather venture to stay there, than to be carried to England to
be hanged.

I then told them, I would let them into the story of my
living there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them. Accordingly I gave them the whole history of the place,
and of my coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the

295
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes,
and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I
told them the story of the Spaniards that were to be expected,
for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them
in common with themselves.

I left them five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and three
swords. I had about a barrel and a half of powder, which I
left them. I gave them a description of the way I managed
the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to make
both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of
my own story; and I told them I would prevail with the cap-
tain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some
garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad
of; also I gave them the bag of peas which the captain had
brought me, and bade them to be sure to sow and increase
them.

Having done this, I left them the next day, and went on
board the ship. The next morning two of the five men came
swimming to the' ship's side, and making a most lamentable
complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the
ship, for God's sake, for they should be murdered.

The captain pretended to have no power without me; but,
after some dificulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were shortly after
soundly whipped, after which they proved very honest and
quiet fellows.

Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men, with
which the captain, at my intercession, sent their chests and

9'97
clothes, which they took, and were very thankful for. I also
encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my way to
send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.

When I quitted this island, I carried on board, for relics,
the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one
of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the money I had had
laid by me so long useless.

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, by the
ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it
twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days; being de-
livered from the second captivity the same day of the month
that I made my escape from among the Moors at Sallee.

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England, the
11th of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years
absent.

 

 

   

EN I CAME to England, I

was as perfect a stranger as
if I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful
steward, whom I left in trust with my money, was alive, but

298
had had great misfortunes in the world, was become a widow
the second time, and was in very low circumstances. I made
her easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give
her no trouble: but, on the contrary, in gratitude to her former
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as much as my little
stock would anrd, which at that time would indeed allow
me to do but little for her; but I assured her I would never
forget her former kindness to me; nor did I forget her when
I had sufficient to help her at a future time.

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father was
dead, and my mother, and all the family extinct, except two
sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers; and, as
I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no
provision made for me, so that, in a word, I found nothing to
relieve or assist me, and the little money I had would not do
much for me, as to settling in the world. .

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had
so' happily delivered, having given a very handsome
account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the
lives of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them
and some other merchants concerned, and all together made
me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a
present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.

But, after making several reflections upon the circumstances
of my life, and how little way this would go towards settling
me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I could
get any information of the state of my plantation in the

299
Brasils, and of what was become of my partner, who, I sup-
posed, had for some years now given me over for dead.

With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived
in April following; my man Friday accompanying me very
honestly in all these ramblings, and pr0ving a most faithful
servant upon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found
out by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old
friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea,
off the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left
off the sea, having put his son into the ship, and who still
used the Brasil trade. The old man did not know me, and I
scarcely knew him; but he soon recollected me when I told
him who I was.

After some passionate expressions of our old acquaintance,
I inquired after my plantation and my partner. The old man
told me he had not been in the Brasils for about nine years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came away my
partner was living, but that the trustees, whom I had joined
with him to take cognizance of my part, were both dead; that,
however, he believed that I should have a very good account
of the improvement of the plantation, for that, in the general
belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had
giVen in the account of the produce of my part of the planta-
tion to the procurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case
I never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds
to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the
benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to
the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me,
to claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only that the

300
improvement, or annual production, being, as he said, dis-
tributed to charitable uses, he thought could not be restored.

I was a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and
inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the
trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when they knew
that I had made my will, and made him, the Portuguese cap-
tain, my universal heir, &c. He told me that was true, but as
there was no proof of my being dead, he could not act as
executor, until some certain account should come of my death;
and that, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a
thing so remote; that it was true, he had registered my will,
and put in his claim, and could he have given any account of
my being dead or alive, he w0uld have acted by procuration,
and taken possession of my ingenio (the sugar-house), and
given his son, who was now in the Brasils, orders to do it.

The old man then asked me if he should put me in a method
to make my claim to the plantation. I told him I thought to
go over to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased; but
that if I did not there were ways enough to secure my right,
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use; and as
there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go to the
Brasils, he made me enter my name in a public register, with
his afidavit, afl'irming, upon oath, that I was alive, and that
I was the same person who took up the land for planting the
said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by a
notary, and a procuration aflixed, he directed me to send it,
with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance
at the place, and then proposed my staying with him till an
account came of the return.

301
Never anything was more honourable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I' re-
ceived a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the
merchants for whose account I went to sea; and as the Brasil
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my let-
ters brought my goods, and the eflects were safe in the Tagus

before the letters came to my hands. fiyihese, it appeared I
wwmuflmwddwfiaboua

pgu'ndsfl sterlingin mopegan and had an.estate,asJ-might well
call it, in the Brasils, ofaboveaihousand/pounds--ayew'as
safe as any landed estate in England, in a Mwmilwvasin a

condition which I could scarce_ly_ understand, or how to. com-
.pose myself for its enjoymgt,__

The first thing I did was to recompense my original bene--
factor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable
to me in my distress, lcind to me in the beginning, and honest
to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent me. I told
him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes all
things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him. So I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw a
procuration, empowering him to be my receiver of the annual
profits of my plantation, and appointing my partner to ac-
count to him, and make the returns by the usual fleets to him,
in my name, adding a clause in the end, being a grant of one
hundred moidores a year during his life, out of the effects;
and fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life: and
thus I requitted my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put

 

302
into my hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head
now than I had in my silent state of life on the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted.

As I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satis-
faction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to
think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first
benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor. So the first thing I did I got a mer-
chant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not
only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her and
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I
lived, have a farther supply. At the same time, I sent my two
sisters in the country, each of them a hundred pounds, they
being, though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances; one having been married, and left 'a widow, and the
other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be.
But, among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were naturalized to the
place, but that I really did not know with whom to leave my
effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England with
them, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some
acquaintance, or find some relations that would be faithful to
me, and accordingly I prepared to go for England with all my
wealth. Having settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned
all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next difliculty

303
was which way to go to England. I had been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to
England by sea at that time; and though I could give no rea-
son for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once but two or three times.

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might
be one of my reasons; but let no man strike the strong im-
pulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two
ships, each of which I had engaged to go in, but again with-
drew my agreement, miscarried, namely, one was taken by
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near
Torbay, and all the people drowned, except three; so that in
either of those vessels I had been made miserable, and in
which most, it was hard to say.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot,
to whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly
not to go by sea; but either to go by land to the Groyne, and
cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais
and Dover; or go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed against my
going by sea at all except from Calais to Dover, that I re-
solved to travel all the way by land, which, as I was not in
haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the
pleasanter way; and to make it more so, my old captain
brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lis-
bon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked
up two more, who were English, and merchants also, and two

304
young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only, so
that we were in all six of us and five servants; the two mer-
chants, and the two Portuguese, contenfing themselves with
one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me,
I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, be-
sides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be
capable of supplying the place of a servant upon the road.

In this manner we set out from Lisbon; and our company
being all very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop,
whereof they did me the honour to call me captain, as well
because I was the oldest man as because I had two servants,
and indeed was the originator of the whole journey.

Four French gentlemen, who had been stopped on the
French side of the passes, as we were now on the Spanish, had
found out a guide, who had brought them over the mountains
by such ways, that they were not much incommoded with the
snow; and, where they met with snow in any quantity, they
said it was frozen hard enough to hear them and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us that he would undertake
to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow,
provided we were armed sufficiently to protect us from wild
beasts; for, he said, upon these snow regions it was common
for wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, while the ground was
covered with snow. We told him we were well enough pre-
pared for such creatures as they were, if he would ensure us
from a kind of two-legged wolves, from which we were told
most danger was to be apprehended, especially on the French
side of the mountains.

305He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to go. So we readily agreed to follow him, as did
also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French,
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were
obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna, with our guide,
on the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when,
instead of going forward, he came directly back with us above
twenty miles; on the same road by which we came from
Madrid, when, having passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow was to be seen;
but, on a sudden, turning to the left, he approached the moun-
tains by another way; and though, it is true, the hills and the
precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, and
meanders, and led us by such winding ways that we insensibly
past the height of the mountains without being much encum-
bered with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascoigne, all
green and flourishing, though indeed they were at a great
distance, and we had some rough way to pass yet.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
so fast one whole day and night, that we could not travel;
but he bade us be easy, we should soon be past it all. We
found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to
come more north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on.'WAL, .
T WAS about two hours be-
fore night, when our guide, be-
ing something before us, and not just in sight, out nrshed
three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hol-
low way, adjoining to a thick wood. Two of the wolves flew
upon the guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he had
been devoured, indeed, before we could have helped him. One
of them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the
man with that violence, that he had not time, or not presence
of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out
to us most lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade
him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday
came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the other,
"0 master! 0 master!" but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up
to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the wolf that attacked him
through the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday:
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in his country,
had no fear upon him, but went up close to him, and shot him

 

307
as above; whereas, any of us would have fired at a farther
distance, and might, perhaps, have either missed the wolf, or

shot the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I;

and indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal
howling of wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the
mountains.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up he was helping him off from his horse, for the man
was both hurt and frightened, and indeed the last more than
the first.

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide
told us, if there were any more wolves in the country, we
should find them there; and this was a small plain, surrounded
with woods on every side, and a long, narrow defile, or lane,
which we were to pass, to get through the wood, and then
we should come to a village where we were to lodge.

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the
first wood; and a little after sunset we came into the plain. We
met with nothing in the first wood, except that, in a little
plain, within the wood, which was not above two furlongs
over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one
after another, as if they had been in chase of some prey they
had in view. They took no notice of us, and were gone, and
out of our sight in a few moments.

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that
we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had little more

308
than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves into readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the wood on our left.

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it the worse on our side; but the noise increasing,
we could easily perceive that it was the bowling of those
ravenous creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two or
three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and
one in Our front, and we knew not what course to take; but
the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us, in
hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred
of them. It happened very much to our advantage, that, at the
entrance into the wood there lay some large timber trees, cut
down, and I drew my little troop in among these trees, and
placing ourselves in a line, behind one long tree, I advised
them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us, for a breast-
work, to stand in a triangle or three fronts, enclosing our
horses in the centre. We did so; and it was. well we did, for
never was a more furious charge than the creatures made
upon us in this place: they came on us with a growling kind
of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, as if they were
only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems,
was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind
us, which was the prey they aimed at. I ordered our men to
fire as before, every other man, and they took their aim so
sure, that they killed several wolves at the first volley; but
there was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came
on like devils, those behind pushing on those before. When we
had fired the second volley of our fusils, we thought they
stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but

309
it was but a moment, for others came forward again, so we
fired two volleys of our pistols, and, I believe, in these four
firings, we killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed
twice as many; yet they came on again.

I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so I called my
servant, not Friday, but my other man, and, giving him a
horn of powder, I bid him lay a train all along the piece of
timber, and let it be a large train. He did so, and had but
just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and
some were got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol
close to the powder, set it on fire. Those that were upon the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or
rather jumped in among us, with the force and fright of the
fire. We despatched these in an instant, and the rest were so
frightened with the light, that they drew back a little.

Upon which I ordered out last pistols to be fired off in one
volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this the wolves
turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty
lame ones, whose dreadful crying and howling scared the
rest, so that they all fled, and left us.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advantage than I can.
I travelled from Thoulouse to Paris, and, without any con-
siderable stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the
14th of January, after having a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had, in a
little time, all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the
bills of exchange which I had brought with me having been

310
currently paid. My principal guide and privy counsellor was
my good old widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had
sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too great, to
employ for me.

I began to think of leaving my effects with this woman, and
setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasils. But now another
scruple came in my way, and that was religion; for as I had
entertained some doubts about the Roman religion, even while
I was abroad, especially in my state of solitude, so I knew
there was no going to the Brasils for me, much less going to
settle there, unless I resolved to embrace the Catholic religion,
without any reserve; except, on the other hand, I resolved to
be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for religion, and
die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at home, and, if I
could find means, to dispose of my plantation.

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who,
in return, gave me notice that he could easily dispose of it
there; but that, if I thought fit to give him leave to oEer it in
my name to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees,
who lived in the Brasils, and must fully understand the value
of it, who lived just upon the spot, and whom I knew to be
very rich, so that he believed they would be fond of buying it,
he did not doubt that I should make four or five thousand
pieces of eight the more for it.

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to olfer it to them,
and he did so; and in about eight months more, the ships
being then returned, he sent me an account that they had
accepted the offer, and had remitted thirty-three thousand

311
pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay
for it. -' - .

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the-form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent
me bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred
pieces of eight for the estate, reserving the payment of one
hundred moidores a year to him, the old man, during his life,
and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I
had promised them, and which the plantation was to make
good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part
of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Providence's
checker-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom
be able to show, the like of. Beginning foolishly, but closing
much more happily than I had ever any reason even to hope
for.

Anyone would think that, in this state of complicated good
fortune, I was past running any more hazards; but I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many relations,
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brasils, yet I could not
keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be
upon the wing again, especially I wuld not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island.

My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it,
and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she
prevented my running abroad; during which time I took my
two nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my
care. The eldest, having something of his own, I bred up as a
gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to his

312
estate after my decease; the other I put out to the captain of a
ship, and, after five years, finding him a sensible, bold, en-
terprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent
him to sea. And this young fellow afterwards drew me in, old
as I was, to farther adventures myself.

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here. For, first of
all, I married, and had three children, two sons and one
daughter. But my wife dying, and my nephew coming home,
with good success, from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to
go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and I engaged to
go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies. In this
voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my suc-
cessors, the Spaniards; had the whole story of their coming to
and adventures in the island, after my departure. All these
things, with some very surprising incidents, in some new ad-
ventures of my own, for ten years more, I may, perhaps, give
a farther account of hereafter.
