PUBLISHERS' NOTE.

To descent upon the merits of a hook that has won the approbation of
critics in every civilized country, and has achieved an almost unequalled
popularity, so that its very name has become a familiar household word,
would, indeed, be a work of supererogation. It is sufficient to say of it,
that the lapse of a century and a half since its first publication has in
no degree impaired the reputation of " Robinson Crusoe." It is a book,
if not " for all time," at least for so long a period as the English language
shall endure; indeed, it may he aver-red that it has taken such firm
root in the literature of the world, and has so widely shed its leaves
of knowledge, morality, and entertainment, as to defy eradication.

It is a great glory to England to have given birth to a cluster of
men whose works have found a world-wide acceptance, and which have
at the same time exerted a salutary influence on the intellectual and
moral development of mankind only inferior to the teachings of Scripture
itself. Amongst these illustrious men--in association with Shakspeare,
Bacon, Milton; Bunyan, and Newton--De Foe is entitled to take rank as
the author of the most entertaining and truth-like fiction that has yet
been, or perhaps ever will be, produced. "Robinson Crusoe" stands
alone as the book of books in its power to fascinate, interest, and elevate
the youthful mind, Moreover, it is not too much to claim for its author
the merit of having greatly assisted in promoting the growth of that
spirit, at once manly, truthful, self-relying, and humane which so

" bADVERTISEMEJT.

pro-eminently distinguishes the English character, and by the exercise
of which our people have become foremost in the noble race of a
healthful civilization, and in spreading its benefits over a very large
portion of the world's surface.

That such a. work, abounding in scenes and situations admirably
adapted for pictorial treatment, should have engaged the willing services
of various excellent artists, is not to be wondered at. It has been a
fertile theme for the exercise of their talent and skill, not only in this
canntry, but abroad, especially in France. It would be invidious here
to attempt to disparage these several attempts, some of which, especially
the designs made, to a limited extent, by Stothard, and the clever French
woodcuts of Grendville, deserve much commendation; but it has long
been acknowledged that the task had not been on the whole satisfactorily
achemplished: and that a series of Illustrations, which should combine
the various elements of poetical feeling, delineation of character, accuracy
of costume and scenery, and artistic effect, was still a desidcrat-um.

Impressed with this conviction, the proprietors of the present Edition,
in the hope of successfully meeting the requirement, resolved to avail
themselves of the services of Mr. J. D. Wmsox, the successful illustrator-
of " The M m-im's Progress"--a cognate work as to popularity; and
this distinguished artist having taken up the subject can amore, Messrs.
DALZIEL, the eminent engmvexs on wood, were entrusted with the
delicate and difficult task of cutting his des'gns. How successfully
this undertaking has been accomplished the present Volume will show,
and it is confidently offered to the public as one that will, at all events,
do credit to English art and typography.CONTENTS.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

_*--

WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a
good family, though not of that country, my father being a
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull: he got a good
. _; estate by merchandise, and leaving oil" his trade, lived after-
--\"k wards a York; fiom whence he had married my mot-her,
whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country,
and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual
corruption of words in England, we are now called--nay we call our-
selves, and write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions always
called me.

I had two older brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an
English regiment on foot in Flanders, formerly commended by the famous
Colonel Loekhart, and was killed at the bottle near Dunkirk against the
Spaniards" What became of my second brother I never knew, any more
than my {other or mother knew what became of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my
head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts: my father,
who was very ancient, had given me o oompetent share of learning, as
far as house-education and a country free-school generally go, and designed
me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to
sea: and my inclination to this led me so etromlv against the will,

my, the commands of my father; and against all the entreaties and
l x
persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life
of misery which was to befol me

My father, a wise and grave mun, gave me serious and excellent
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called mo one
morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon tins subject: he asked me what
reasons, more than a mere wum'lering inclination, I had for leaving my
father's house and my native country, where I might be well introduced>
and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry,
with a life of ease and pleasure, He told me it was men of desperate
fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who
went abroad upon xulvcntures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common mod; and these
things were all either too far above me, or too far below me; that
mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station
of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state
in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not expo-red to the
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufi'erings of the mechanic part
of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of the
happiness of this state by this one thing, viz. that this was the state
of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented
the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and Wished they
had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and
the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard
of 'felicily, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; but
that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay,
they were not subjected to so many distempers, and uneasiness, either
of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and
extrm'aganecs on one hand, or by hard luhour, want of necessaries, and
mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon
themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind

of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmuids of a middle

fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable
diversions, and all desirable pleum'es, were the blessings attending the
middle station of life; that thin way men want silently and smoothly
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the
labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for
daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the

soul of peace, and the body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of
3
envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in
easy circumstances, sliding gently through the World, and sensibly tasting
the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy,
and learning by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most niTectionatc
manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into
miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my
bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me;
and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be
my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me
against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that
as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at
home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my mis-
fortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go away; and to close
all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the
Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting
him to run into the army, where he was killed; and though he said
he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to
me, that if I did take this foolish step God would not bless me and
I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his
counsel,,when there might be none to assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly pro-
phetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself;
I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed; and that when he spoke
of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved
that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he
could say no more to me

I was sincerely allected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could
be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more,
but to settle at home according to my father's desire But alas! a few
days wore it all off ; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further
importnnitfies, in a. few weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from

him. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my
4031:6va Mo'rulm nnvum Inn mlsmucu

resolution prompted, but I took my mother at a time when I thought
her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should never settle
to anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my hither
had better give me his consent than force me to go without. it; that I was
now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade,
0\' clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve
out my time, hut I should certainly run away frum my master before

my time was out, and go to-sea; and if she would speak to my father
5
to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like
it, I Would go no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to
recover the time that I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she knew it
would he to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject ;
that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to any-
thing so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think
of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such
kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me;
and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me;
but. I might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for
her part, she would not have so muclrhand in my destruotion; and I
should never haveit to say that my mother was willing when my
father was not , '

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard
afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father,
after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a. sigh: "That
hoy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad,
he will he the nzost miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give
no consent to it." -

It was not till almost a your after this that I broke loose, though, in
the mean time, I continued obstinately (leaf to all proposals'oi' settling
to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother
about their being so positively determined against what they knew my
inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, wheie I went
casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;
but, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail
to London in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them
with the common allurcment of seafaring men, that it should cost me
nothing for my passage, 1 consulted neither father nor mother any more,
nor so much as sent- them word of it ; but leaving them to hear of it
as they might, without asking God's blessing or my father's, without
any-consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour
God knows, on the 1st of September, 1651, I went. on board a ship
bound for London. Never any ymxng adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,
begun sooner, or oontinued longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner
out of the Number, than the wind began to How and the sea to rise

in a most frightful manner; and, as I had new.) been at sen before, I
5
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I began
now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was
overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's
house, and abandoning my duty. All the good counsels of my parents,
my father's tears and my mother's entresties, came now fresh into my
mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of
hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the contempt of
advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea. went very high,
though nothing like whet I have seen many times since; no, nor what
I saw a. few days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was
but a. young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. I
expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time
the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the
sea, we should never rise more: in this agony of mind, I made many
vows and resolutions, that if it would please God .to spare my life in
this one voyage, if over 1 got once my foot upon dry land again, I would
go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while
I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such
miseries as these any more. Now I sew plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably
he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at
sea, or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like u true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm
lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated,
and the sea calmer, and I began to be a. little inured to it: however,
I was very grove for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but
towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear,
and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a
smooth sea, the sun shining upon it. the sight was, as I thought, the
most delightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but
very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough
and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
so little 8. time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue,

my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me: "Well, Bob,"
7
says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do you do after it? I
warrant you were frighted, wcr'n't you, last night, when it blew but a
capful of wind?"--_" A capful d'yOu call it?" said I; " 'twas a terrible
storm."--"A storm, you fool you," replies he; " do you call that a
storm? why, it was nothing at all; give us but it good ship and sea-
rocxn, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but
you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of
punch, and we'll forget all that; d'ye see what charming weather 'tis
now?" To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way
of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was made half-drunk with
it; and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance,
all my reflections upon my post conduct, all my resolutions for the
future. In .a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface
and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of
my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed
up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires
returned, I entirely forgot the vow; and promises that I made in my
distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I
shook them ofl', and reused myself from them as it were from a distemper,
and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the
return of those fits--for so I called them; and I had in live or six
days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow
that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to
have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally
it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not
take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst
and most hardened wreteh among us would confess both the danger
and the mercy of.

The sixth day of our being at see. we came into Yarmouth Roads;
the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had made
but little" way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz., at south
west, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships
from Newcastle came into the same roads, as the common harbour where
the ships might wuit for a wind for the river.

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have tided it up

the river, but that the Wind blew too fresh, and, utter we had lain four or
a
five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good as
a harbour, the anchomge good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men
were uncunccrned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent-
thc time in rest and mirth, after the manner afithe sea; but the eighth day,
in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike

our top-masts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship might
ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our
ship mde forecastie in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice
our anchor had come home ; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-
anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered

out to the better and.
9 o
By this time it. blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I begun to see
terror and amazement in the feces even of the seamen themselves. The
master, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he
went in and out. of his cabin. by me, I could hear him softly to himself say,
several times, "Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost; we shall be
all undone l" and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying
still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my
temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself mainst: I thought the bittemess of
death had been past; and that this would be nothing. like the first; but
when the master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin.
and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea ran
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; when I
could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us ; two ships that
rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden;
and our men cried out, that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of
us was foundered. .Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were
run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that not with u mast
standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the
see; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away
with only their spritsnil out before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and bontswain begged the master of our ship
to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do;
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship would
founder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the
main-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to
cut that away also, and make a clear deck.

And one must judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was
but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little,
But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that
time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account: of my former
convictions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions 1' had
wickedly taken at lixst, than T was at death itself ! and these, added to the
terror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that 1 can by no Words
describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with
such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a

worse, "'e hnd a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the
10
sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder.
IL was my advantage in one respect- that I did not know what they meant
byfmmder, till I inquired However the storm was so violent, that I saw,
what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some othets more
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when

the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see,
cried out we had sprung a leak ; another said, there was four feet water in
the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my

heait, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the side of
n
my bed where I set, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and
told me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to
pump as another; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing some light
oolliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip, and run
away to the sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal
of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had
broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his
own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot,
let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before
I came to myself -

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent
that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a
little, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into
any port; so the master continued fixing guns for help; and a light ship,
who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's
side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives
to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it,
and then veered it out a great length, which they, after much labour
and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under oiir stern, and
got all into their boat It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were
in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her
drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our
master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would
make it good to their master: so partly rowing, and partly driving, our
boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far
as Winter-ton Ness.

We were not much more than a. quarter of an hour out of our ship till
we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant
by a ship thundering in the sea I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes
to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment
that they rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in,
my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, portly with
horror of mind, and. the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition--the men yet labouring at. the oar to
bring the boat near the shore--we could see (when, our boat mounting the
waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along
the strand, to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow
way towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till, being past

we got in, and. though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore,
and walked afterwards on foot to Vermont-h, where, as unfortunate men: we
were used with great liummiily, as well by the magistrates of the town, who
assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships,

Tlull, as we thought lit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone hack in Hull) and have gone
home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Snviour'a parable,
luul even killed the felted calf for me; for hearing the ship 1' went away in
was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any
assurances that l was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could
resist ; and though I' had several times loud calls-from my reason, and my
more composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power to do it I know
not what to call this, nor Willi urge that it is a-secret overruling decree,
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destination, even
though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open.
Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was
impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm masonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and mains:
two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the
master's son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to me
after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or tlnee days, for we
were. separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw
me, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and
shaking his head, lie-asked me how I did, and telling his father who 1 wns,
and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go further
abroad: his father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned (one.
"Young man," says he, " you ought never to go to see any more; you ought
to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring
mun." " Why sir," said I, " will you go to set). no more?" "That is another
case," said he ; "it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you see. what- a taste Heaven has given you of what
you are to expect. if you persist>> Perhaps this has all hefallen us on your
Dereount, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," omitinues he, " what- are
you; and on what. account did you go to sea?" Upon that I told him some

of my story ; at the end of which he burst out into'a strange kind of passion:
14CXINOY. "Benn-1:5 A lllfl'mxnl mom ma nsnan'a LUBE".

" What had I done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come
into my ship '2 I would not set- my foot in the same ship with thee again
for a thousand pounds." This indeed was, as I said, an cxcuision of his
spirits, which wem yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther
than he could have authority to go. Howevex; he afterwards talked very
gravely Ln me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt Provi--
dance to my ruin, balling me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against
me. " And, young man," said he, " depend upon it, if you do not go back,
wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappoint-
ments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."
15
We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no
more; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some money in
my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the
mud, had many struggles with myself, what course of life I should take,
and whether I should go home or go to see.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my
thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I should he laughed at
among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and
mother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often
observed, how hicongruous.snd irrational the common temper of mankind
is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such
cases, viz, that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent;
not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools,
but are ashamed of the returning. which only can make them be esteemed
wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what
measures to take, and what course of life to lead An irresistible reluc-
tance continued to going home; and as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of
the distress I had been in were ofi' ; and as that abated, the little motion I
had in my desires to return wore ofl' with it, till at last I quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That- evil influence which carried me first away from my father's house,--

which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my
fortune ; and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make
me deaf to all good advice, and to tho entreaties and oven the commands of
my father -,--I say, the some influence, whatever it was, presented the most
unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel
bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly called it, a
voyage to Guinem

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship
myself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked a little
harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should have learnt the duty
and office of a foremost man, and in time m'ght have qualified myself for
a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master: But as it was always my fate to
choose for the'worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket and
good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the' habit of a
gentlemen; and so I neither had any business in the ship, nor learned

to do any.
16
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,
which does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows
as I then was -, the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them
very early ; but it was not so with me. I first get acquainted with the
master of a. ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having
had very good success there, was resolved to go again. This captain taking
a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time,
hearing me say I had a. mind to see the world, told me if I would go the
voyage with him I should be at no expense; I should be his messmote and
his companion; and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all
the advantage of it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet
with some encourmement.

I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this
captain, who was an honest, plain~deeling man, I went the voyage with him,
and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested honesty
of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about
PS40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. Those MO
I had mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations whom
I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my father, or at least my
mother, to contribute so much as that to my first adventurer '

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my
adventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the
captain; under whom also I got a-competent knowledge of the mathematics
and the rules of navigation, loomed how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some things that
were necdful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight to
instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a. word, this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces
of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return,
almost PS300; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have
since so completed my ruin.

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; particularly, that I
was continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive
heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the coast, from the
latitude of fifteen degrees north even to the line itself,

I was now set up for 3. Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great mis-
fortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the some voyage again,

mud I embarked in the some vessel with one who was his mate in the
17 n
former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This was the
unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite
PS100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had .6200 left, which I had lodged
with my friend's widqw. who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible

misfortunes: the first \vmz this--our ship making her course towards the

Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the African shore, was

surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sauce, who gave

chase to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much
18
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry to get clear , but find.
ing the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in in few
hours, we prepared to fight; our ship 11szng twelve guns, and the rogue
eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing
to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he
intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in
a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our
lire, and pouring in also his small shot: from near two hundred men which
he had on board, However, we had not a. man touched, all our men
keeping close, I-[e prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves.
But laying us on board the next; time upon our other quarter, he entered

sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the
sails and rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-
chests, and such like, and cleared out deck of them twice. However, to cut
short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three
of our men killed, and eight Wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were
carried ull prisoners into Sullee, a port belonging to the Moore

~ 19
this surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked back upon my
father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable and have none
to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that
I could not be worse ; for now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and
l was undone without redemption; but, nine! this was but a taste of the
misery l' was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was
in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again, believ-
ing that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or
Portugal ninu-of-wsr; and that then I should he set at liberty. But this
hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to see, he left me on
shore to look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house ; and when he come home again from his cruise, he ordered
me to lie in the. cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take
to ell'ect it. but found no way that had the least probability in it ; nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational : for I had nobody to com-
znunicate it to that would embark with me--no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchmxm, there but myself; so that for two years, though I
often pleased myself with the imaginution, yet I never had the least encourag-
ing prospect of putting it in practice.

After about two yours, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put
the old thought of making some. attempt for my liberty again in my head
My patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,
which, as I heard, was for want of money, he used, constantly, once or twice
u week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnucc,
and go out into the read a-fishing; and, as he always took me and young
Maresco with him to row the heat, we made him very merry, and I proved
very dexterous in catching fish ; insoniuoh that sometimes he would send me
with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth--the M oresco, as they called
him---to catch a dish of fish for him.

Tl. happened one time, that going a-fishing in o colin morning, a fog rose
so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we lost sight
of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, We laboured all day,
and all the next night; and when the morning came, we found we had
pulled off to sea instuul orpulling in for the shore; and that we were at
least two leagues from the shore. However, we get well in gain, though with

a great deal of labour and some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty
fresh in the, morning ; but. we were all very hungry.

But our patron, Warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care
of himself for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our
English ship that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any
more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter
of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or
cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that; of a harge, with a place
to stand behind it. Lo steer, and haul home the main--sheet; and room
before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what
we call a. shoulder--of-mntmn sail; and the boom gibed over the top of the
cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in is room for him to lie,
with a slave or two, and a. table to out on, with some small lockers to put
in some bottles of such liquor as he thonght- fir. to drink; and his bread

rice. and cofl'ee
22
We went frequently out with his boat a-fishing; and as I was most
dcxterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish.
with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for whom
he had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the bout
over-night a larger store of provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me
to get ready three [misses with powder and shot, which were on board his
ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning
with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and everything
to accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on board
alone, and told me his guests ha.rl put off going, from some business that
fell out, and ordered me, with the men and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his
house; and commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it
home to his house ; all which I prepared to do.

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,
for now T found I was likely to have a little ship at my command;
and my master being gone, l.prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing
business, but for a. voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much
as consider, whither I should steely--anywhere to get out of that place
was my desire. _ _

My first. oontrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor,
to get something for our subsistence on board ; for I told him we must
not presume to eat of our patron's breed. He said that was true; so
he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh
water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood,
which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English
prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as
if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a great
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above half a. hundred-
weight, with a. parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, u sew, and a hammer.

-.all of which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax to
make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently
came into also: his name was Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely;
so 'I called to him :--"Moely," said I, " our patron's guns are on board
the boat; can you not get a. little powder and shot? It may be we

.may kill some atlcomies (a. fowl like our cnrlews) for ourselves. for I
22
know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship." "Yes," says he, "I'll
bring some;" and accordingly he brought a. great leather pouch, which
held a. pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with
shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into
the boat. At the same time, I had found some powder of my master's
in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the
case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another;
and thus furnished with everything uocdful, we. sailed out of the port to
fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we
were, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile' out of
the pelt before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The
wind blew fmm the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire, for had
it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain,
and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were,
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place
where I was, and leave the rest'to fate. .

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for when I had
fish on my hook, I would not pull them up, that he might not see them,
1 said to the Moor, "This will not do; our master will not be thus
served; we must stand thither off." He, thinking no harm, agreed, and.
being in the head of the boat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm,
I run the boat out near a league farther, and then brought her to;
as if I would fish ; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward
to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for something
behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm under his waist, and
tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he
swam like a cork, and called to me, be god to be taken in, told me
he would go all over the world with me. He swam so strong after the
boat, that he would have reaehed me very quickly, there being but little
wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the
fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had done him no
hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none: "But," said
I, "you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the sea is calm;
make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm; but
if you come near the bout, I'll shoot you through the head, for I am
resolved to have my liberty : " so he turned himself about, and swum for
the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was

an excellent swimmer.
23
I could have been content. to have taken this Moor with me. and
have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him When
he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to
him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you a. great man;
but if you will not. stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear
by Mahomet and his father's heard, "I must thmw you into the sea
too." The boy smiled in my lime, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not distrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the
world with me.

While. I was in View of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out
directly to son with the bout, rather stretching to windward, that they
might think me gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed any one
that had heen in their wits must have been supposed to do): for who
would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the truly
Barbarian coast, where whole nations of Xegroes were sure to surround
us with their ounces, and destroy Iisg'where we could not go on shore.
but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
of human kind.

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course,
and steered directly south and by cost, bending my course a little lowurds
the east, that I might keep in with the shore: and huving u fair, fresh
gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sen, I made such sail that. I believe
by the next day at three- o'cleck in the afternoon, when I first made
the land, I could not be lrss than one hundred and fifty miles south
of Sallee: quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's rlznuinions, or indeed
of any other king tliercnbouts, for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dreadful
apprehensions I hail of falling into their hands, that I would not. stop,
or go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing i'air till I
had sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to
the southward, ] concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase
of me, they nlso would now give over; so I ventured to make to the
coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I know
not. what, nor where; neither whet latitude, what country, what nation.
or what river. I neither saw, nor desired to see nny people; the principal
thing I want-2d was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it- was dark, and discover Lhe

country; but us soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
24xcm' sin-EARN 'm m: nunru.

noises of the barking, roaring. and howling of wild creatures, of we knew
not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged of me not to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said 1, " then
1 won't; but. it may be that. we may see men by day, who will he 'as
had to us as those lions."---"Then we .givc them the shoot gun," suys
Xury, laughing, "make them run way." Such English Xury spoke by
conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad to see the. boy so
cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out. of our patron's ease of bottles)
to cheer him up. After all, any's advice was good, and 1 tool; it: we
dropped our little anchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept
none; l'ur in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew
not what to call them) of many sorts. come down to l(he sea-shone, and
run into the Water, "wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure
of cooling themselves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings,
that I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were
both more frighted when we heard one. of these mighty creatures come

25 z
swimming towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear
him by his blowing to he a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury
said it was a. lion, and it might be so for ought I know; but poor Xury
cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away: " No," says I, " Xury; we
can slip our cable, with the buoy to it, and go 011'. to see; they cannot
follow us far." I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature
(whatever it was) within two oara' length, which something surprised me ;
however, I immediately stepped to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun,
fired at him; upon which he immediately turned about, and swam towards
the shore again.

.But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries
and howliugs, that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as
higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing I
have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before: this
convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night on
that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another question
too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as had as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and tigers; at least
we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where
to get to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore
with one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring
some to me. I asked him why he would go? why I should not go,
and he stay in the boat>>? The boy answered with so much all'ection,
as made me love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come, they
eat me, you go wey."~---"<Well, Xury," said I, " we will bot-h go, and if
the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us."
So I gave Xury a piece of rush bread to out, and a. dram out of our
patron's case of bottles which I mentioned before; and we hauled the
boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper, and so waded on
shore; carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of
canoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place
about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by--and--by I saw him
come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage,
or firighted with some wild beast, and I run forwards towards him to
help him; but when 1 came nearer to him, I saw something hanging

' 2G 'on nosmson chosen.

over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like :1 here, but
difl'erent in colour, and longer legs: however, we were very glad of it, and
it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to
tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water,
for a little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh
when the tide was out, which flowed but a. little way up; so we filled our
jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way,
having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country.

 

TR! "001" '10 A BORING X'K AR aux

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that
the islands of the Canaries and the Cape de Verd Islands also, lay not far
ofi' from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an observation to
know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing, or at least
remembering, what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to see towards them; otherwise I might now
easily have found some of these island: But my hope was, that if I stood
along this coast till I came to that part where the English traded, I should
find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would
relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that

country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the
' 27
Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes
having abandoned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moors; and the
Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barronness; and,
indeed, both l'orsaking it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions,
leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour there; so that the
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, lzwo or
three thousand men at a time: and, indeed, for near r. hundred miles to-
gether upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by
day. and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the (11 y-Linic, I thought 1' saw the l'ico of 'l'eneritfe,
being the high top of the Mountain Toneri'l'e in the Canaries; and had a
great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but. having tried
twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high
for my little vessel ; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left
this place; and once in particular, being early in the morning, we came to
an anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high ; and the tide
beginning to flow, we lay still to go further in. Xury, whose eyes were more
about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we
had best go farther off the shore; "for." says he, "look, yonder lies a
dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked where
he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great
lion that lay (In the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill
that hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," says I, " you shall go on
shore and kill him." Xury looked frighted, and said, " Me kill! he eat me
at one mouth ;" one mouthful he meant. However, l said no more to the
boy. but. bade him lie still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost
musket. bore. and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two
slugs; and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and
the third {for we had three pieces) 1 loaded with five smaller bullets. I
took the best aim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head
but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose that the slugs hit
his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up, growling at
first, but finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got up upon
three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little
surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up the

second pieac immediately, and though he began to move off, fired again, and
28
shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but
little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would
have me let him go on shore. "Well, go," said I : so the he)' jumped into
the water, und taking a. little gun in one hand, sworn to shore with the
other hand, and coming close to the creature. put the muzzle of the piece to
his our, and shot him in the head again, which despamhed him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good
for nothing to us. However, Xur)r said he would have some ol' him; so he
comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet " For what, Xury?"
said i. " Me out off his head," said he However, Xury could not cut
off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a
monstrous great one.

I bethough't myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him might, one
way or other, he of some value to us ; and l resolved to take off his skin if
I could. So X'ur)r and I went to work with him; but Xur)r was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us
both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and spreading
it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days' time,
and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve
days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began. to abate very
much, and going no oftoner to the shore than we were obliged to for fresh
water. My design in this was, to make the River Gambia or Senegal, that
is to soy, anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet
with some European ship ; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had
to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there among the. Negroes. T
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of
Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands;
and, in a Word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either
that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.

When I hadpursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have
said, I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in two or three
places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us ;
we could. also perceive they were quite black, and naked. I was once
inclined to have gone on shore to thorn ; but Xur)r was my better coun-
sellor, and said to me, "No go, no go." However, I hauled in nearer the

shore that I might talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by
29
me a good way: I observed they had no weapons in their hands, except
one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a. lance, and that
they could throw them a. great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance,
but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and particularly made
signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay
by, and two of them run up into the country, and in less than half an hour
come back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn,
such as is the produce of their country; but we neither knew what the one
or the other was: however, we were willing to accept it. but how to come
at- it was our next dispute, for I would not venture on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us: but they took a safe way {or us all,
for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a.
great way off till we fetched it on board, and then came close'to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them
amends; but an opportunity olTered that very instant to oblige them won-
derfully: for while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty creatures,
one pursuing the other (as we took it} with great fury from the mountains
towards the see; whether it was the male piusuing the female, or whether
they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because,
in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night ;
and, in the second place. we found the people terribly frighted, especially
the women. The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them,
but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water,
they .did not offer to fell upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves
into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their diversion: at
last one of them begun to come nearer our boat than at first I expected;
but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible expo,
dition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon us he came fairly
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the hood: immediately
he sank down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down,
as if he wan; struggling for life, and so indeed he was: he immediately made
to the shore; but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the
strangling or the water, he died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at
the noise and fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to die for
fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; Lut when they saw the

30
creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to
come to the shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for the
creature I found him by his blood staining the water: and by the help
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they
dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted,
and fine to an admirable degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with
admiration; to think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the
gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from whence
they came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I found
quickly the Negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so I was
willing to have them take it as a favour from me; which, when I made
signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful for.
Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they hud no knife,
yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and
much more readily, than we could have done with a knife. They ofi'ered
me some of the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that I would give it
them ; but made signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and
brought me a great deal more of their provisions, which, though I did not
understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them for some water,
and held out one of _my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme--
diately to some of their friends, and there come two women, and brought a
great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I supposed, in the sun; this they
set down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled
them all three The women were as naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water;
and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a
great length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues before
me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point.
At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side, to seaward: then I concluded, as it was
most certain indeed, that this was the Cape do Vcrd, and those the islands
called, from thence, Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great
distance, and I could not well tell what 1 had best to do; for if I should be
taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one or other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin, and
31
sat down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,
" Master, master, a ship with a sail !" and the foolish boy was frighted out
of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent to
pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their reach. I jumped
out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but that; it was a
Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for
Negroes. But, when I observed the course she steered, I was soon con-
vinced they were bound some other way, and (lid not design to come any
nearer to the shore: upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could,
resolving to speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in
their way, but that they would be gone by before I could make. any signal
to them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they,
it seems, saw, by the help of their glasses, that it was some European boat,
which they supposed must; belong to some ship that was lost; so they
shortened sail. to let me come up. l'was eneonmged with this, and as I
had my patron's ancient on board, I made a. wafi of it, to them, for a signal
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they
very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in about three houis time
I came up with them. ,

They asked me what I was, in Pm-t'uguese, and in Spanish, and in
French, but I understood none of them; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who
was on board, called to me: and I answered him, and told him I was an
Englishman. that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at
Sallee; they then bade me come on board. and very kindly took me in.
and all my goods.

It. was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I was
thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless
condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to the captain
of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously told me
he would take nothing"r from me, but that all I had should he delivered
safe to me, when I came to the Biuzils. "For," says he, "I have saved
your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be saved mfself ; and
it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition.
Besides," said he, " when I carry you to the Brazils, so great; a way from
your own country, if I should take from you when you have, you will be
starved there, and then I only take away that. life I have givul No, no,"ukuwu ls Tm vI- m' A Pum'uxmaa: VlA'sEL.

says he: " Suignor Inglese" (Mr. Englishman), " I will carry you thither in
charity, and those things will help to buy your subsistence there, and your
passage home again."

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the. performance
to 0. Little; for he aordercd the seamen, that none should touch anything
that I had: then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me.
back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even to my three
earthen jars.

As to my bout, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me
he would buy it of me for his ship's use 3 and asked me what I would have
for it? [told him, he had been so generous to me in Lively-thing, that I '

' could not. offer to make any price of the boat, but. lcl'L it entirely to him:
33 9
upon which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty
pieces of eight for it at Brazil , and when it come there, if any one offered
.to give more, he would make it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of
eight more for my ho)r Xury, which I was loath to take; not that I was
unwilling to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor
boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
ofl'ered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set him
free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon this, and Xury saying he
was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Bruzils, and I arrived in the Bay de
Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty--two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of
life; and what to do next with myself I was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough
remember: he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty
ducms for the leopard's skin, and fort)r for the lion's skin, which I had in
my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered
to me; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of me, such as the case
of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of becs'-wax--l'or I had
made candles of the rest : in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty
pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock, I went on shore
in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the house of a
good, honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio, as they call it (that is,
a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of planting and making
of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich
suddenly, I resolv,ed if I could get a licence to settle there, I would turn
plantei among them; resolving, in the mean time, to find out some way to
get my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this
purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization, I purchased as much
land that was uneined as my money would leael1,and formed a plan for
my plantation and settlement; such a. one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English parents,
whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. I call

him my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went
34
on very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than anything else, for about two years. However,
we began to increase, and our land begun to come into order; so that the
third your we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come. But we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my boy Xury. .

But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great wonder.
I had no remedy but to go on : I had got into an employment quite remote
to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which
I forsook my father's house, and broke through all his good advice. Nay, I
was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which
my father advised me to before, and which, if I resolved to go on with, I
might as well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the
world, as I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I could have done
this as well in England, among my friends, as hove gone five thousand
miles oil' to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such
a distance as never to hear fiom any part of the world that had the least
knowledge of me

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost
regret I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour;
no work to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I
lived just like a man cast aw; y upon some desolate island, that had nobody
there but himself. But how just has it been--and how should all men
reflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others that
are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced
of their former felicity by their experience--I say, how just has it been, that
the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should
be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then
led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all probability, been exceeding
prosperous and rich.

I wus, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the
plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up
at son, went back--for the ship remained there, in providing his hiding, and
preparing for his voyage, nearly three months ; when, telling him what little
stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere
advice z--"Seignor Inglese," says he (for so he always called me), " if you

will give me letters, and a proouration in form to me, with orders to the
35
person who has your money in London, to send your efl'ects to Lisbon, to
such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my return;
but, since human afi'airs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would
have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say.
is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so that, if.it come
safe, you may order the rest the same way; and, if it miscarry, you may
have the other half to have recourse to for your supply." -

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not
but be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly
prepared letters to the gentlewornan with whom I had left my money, and
a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired

I'wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my adventures
--my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese captain at sea,
the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now in, with all
other necessary directions for my supply; and when this honest captain
came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants there,
to send over, not the order only, but a full account of my story to a
.merchant at London, who represented it effectually to her; whereupon she
not only delivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portugal
captain a Very handsome present for his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred poundsjn English goods,
such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,
and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without
my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of them), he had
taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes made, for I was
surprised with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid out
the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to
purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and
would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I
would have him accept, being of my own produce ,

Neither was this all ; for my goods being all English manufacture, such
as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that I
might say, I had more than four times the value of my first cargo, and wasl

now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour--I mean in the advancement of
36
my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and an
European servant also~I mean another besides that which the captain
brought me from Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our
greatest adversity, so was it with me I went on the next year with great
success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own
ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours;
and these fill-y rolls, being each of above a hundred-weight, were well cured,
and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon : and now increasing
in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and under-
takings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best
heads in business Had I continued in the station I was new in, 1 had
room for all the happy things to have yet befolleu me, for which my father
so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and of which he had so
sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of ; but other things
attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries;
and particularly, to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon
myself, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish
inclination of wandering abroad, and pulsuing that inclination, in oontradic
tion to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain puisuit of
those prospects, and those measures of life, which nature and Providence
concurred to present me with, and to make. my duty.

As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I
could not be content now, but I nuist go and leave the happy view I had of
being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash
and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing
admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the. deepest gulf of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with
life, and a slate of health in the world

To come, then, by the just degrees, to the particulars of this part of my
story :--You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the
Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation,
1 had not only learned the language, but had contracted acquaintance and
friendship among my .i'ellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at
St. Salvador, which was our port ; and that, in my discourses among them.
I had frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast of

Guinea; the manner of trading with the Xegroes there, and how easy it was
37
to purchase upon the coast for triflcs--such as beads, toys, knives, scissors,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like--not only gold dust, Guinea. grains,
elephants' toot-h, &c, but eroea, for the service of the Brazils, in great
numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,
but especially to that part which related to the buying Negroes, which was
a. trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but. as far as it w. , had
been carried on by ossiontos, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock; so that few Negroes were
bought, and those excessively door.

'It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my
acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much
upon what I had disooursed with them of the last night, and they came to
make a secret proposal to me ; and, after enjoining mo secrecy, they told me
that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all
plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as
servants ; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they
could not publicly sell thh Negroes when they came home, so they desired
to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide
them among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was,
whether I would go their supercnrgo in the ship, to manage the trading part
upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should have my
equal share of the Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it been made to any
one that had not had a settlement and a. plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a. good
stock upon it; but for me, that was thus entered and established, and had
nothing to do but to go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and
to have sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and who in that
time, and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth
three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too--for me to
think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever man in
such circumstances could be guilty oPS

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the
offer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my

heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
38tan: rum m A lawman. 'm mums.

and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscan'iecl This
they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so; and
I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and oil'ects in case of my
death, making the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my
universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in
my will; one-half of the produce being to himself, and the other to be
shipped in England,

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to keep
up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to have looked into
my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have done
and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous
an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving circumstance,

and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards,
so
to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to
myself.

But. I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy
rather than my reason: and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the
cargo furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my partners in the
voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the lst of September, 1659, being
the same day eight years that I went from my father and mother at Hull, in
order to act- the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interests,

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men-besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had on
board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade
with the Negroes, such as heads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifles, espe-
cially little looking--glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets and the like

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the north--
ward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast
when We came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it
seems, was the manner of course in those days. We had very good weather,
only excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we come to the
height of Cape St. Augustine; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we
lost sight. of land, and steered us if we were bound for the isle Fernando de
Noronhu, holding our course NE. by N., and leaving those isles on the east.
In this course We passed the line in about twelve days' time, and were, by
our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes Northern latitude,
when it violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge.
It began from the south-cast, came about to the north--west, and then settled
in the north-oust ; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before
it, let it carry us whither cvcr fate and the fury of the winds directed ; and,
during these twelve days, I need not say that T expected every day to be
swallowed up ; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives.

In this distress We had, besides the terror of the. storm, one of our men
die of the calenlnre, and one man and the boy \vushed overboard. About
the twelfth day, the weather ahating a little, the master made an observation
as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven degrees north
latitude, but that he was twenty--two degrees of longitude difi'erence west.
from Cape St. Augustine; so that he found he was upon the coast of
Guiana, or the north part. of Brazil, beyond the river Annmons, towards that
ol' the river Oroonoquc, commonly called the Great llirer; and began to

consult with me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and
very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the coast of Brazil.

1' was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the sea-
coast of America. with him, we concluded there was no inhabited country
for us to have recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Caribbee
Islands, emd therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes; which, by
keeping all at sea, to avoid the indmft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, We
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about. fifteen (lays' sail; whereas we
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa. without some
assistance both to our ship and to omselves.

With this design we changed our amuse, and steered away NM". by "7.,
in order to reach some of our English islands, \vhei'e I hoped for relief. But
our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of twelve
degrees eighteen minutes, a. second storm came upon us, which carried us

away with the some impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the way
u. G
of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as to the sea, we
were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to
our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early
in the morning cried out, "land !" and we had no sooner run out of the
cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were,
than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so
stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the
sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We
knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven----
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited. As the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at first, we could
not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without breaking
into pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately
about. In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man, accordingly, preparingr for another world;
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this. That which was our
present comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our
expectation, the ship (lid not break yet, and that the master said the Wind
began to abate.

Now, though we thought that the Wind did a little abate, yet the ship
having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting oil', we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do
but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our
stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the
ship's rudder, and in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or
was driven off to see; so there was no hope from her. We had another
boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing.
However, there was no time to debate, for we fancied the ship would break
in pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest of the men, got her slung over the ship's side; and
getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in

number, to God's mercy and the wild son; for though the storm was abated
4-2
considerably, yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore, and might be
well called den wild zero, as the Dutch call the sea in a. storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly, that
the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should be
inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could
we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew
that when the boat came nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a
thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our
souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards
the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well
as we could towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we
knew not. The only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation, was, if we might find some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some
river, where by great chance we might have run our host in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was nothing
like this appeared; but as we made. nearer and nearer the shore, the land
looked more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a. half, as we
reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astcrn of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup dc grace. In a word, it took us with such
o. fury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as well from the
boat as from one another. gave us not time to say, "0 God ! " for we were
all swallowed up in a. moment

Nothm can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I sunk
into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or
rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself,
went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the
water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left,
that, seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon my
feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before
another wave should return and take me up again ; but I soon found it was
impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great
hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to
contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon

the water, if I could; and so, by swimming, to preserve my breathing and
43
pilot myself t011- aids the shore, if possible, 1111-" greatest concern now being,
that- the sea as ibx1ould (zany me 11 great way towznds the slime when it

breath, and assisted myself to swim still [in-wm'd with all my 111ight. I was
ready to burst. with holding my breath, when as I felt myself raising up, so.
to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the
surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I
could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, govt: me breath and new
courage. I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long but
1 held it out; and, finding the water had spent: ilself and began to return, 1
struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with
my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover breath and till the waters
went. from me, and then took to my heels and ran, with what strength 1
had, further towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the
fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again; and twice more 1
was lifted up by the waves and carried {on 1111'le as before, the shore
being very flat.

The last. time of these. two had well-nigh been fatal to 1111:, for the. sea

God that. my life was saved, in a case wherein there was, some minutes
before, scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to
the life, what- flu: custasies and transports ol' the soul are, when it is so
saved, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at
the custom, when a inalcfuctor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied
up, and just going to he turned off, and has a. replievo brought to him--l
say, I do not. wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood
that very moment; they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the
animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him.

For sudden joys, like grids, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole bring,
us I may say, wrapt. up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a
thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe ; reflecting upon all
my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul
saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were
not fellows.

I cast. my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the
sea being so big, I could hairdl)r see it, it lay so for oli'; and considered,
Lord! how was it possible I could get- on shore?

I had a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor
anything either to eat or drink 00 comfort me; neither did I see any

Night coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what ivould
be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night
they always come abroad for their prey.

 

53350); 01-18 "110 A m '10 SEW

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time, was to get up
into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I
should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life; I walked about a fax-long

from the shore. to see if I could find any fi'csh water to drink, which I did,
47
to my great joy; and having drank, and puLu little tobacco in my mouth-
to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured Io
plane myself so that if I should sleep I might not full. And having cut me
a. short stick, like a trunoheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and
having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and found myself more
mi'reshed with it than, I think, I ever was on such an occasion.

When I wuked it was broad day, the weatl'ier clear, and the-storm
abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before. But that which
surprised me most was, that theship was lifted off in the night from the
sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost
as far as the rock which I at; first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the wave dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from
the shore where l was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished
myself on board, that at least I might save some necessary things for
my Use. _

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me
again, and the first thing 1 found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and
the sea had tassed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right
hand. I walked as for as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but
found a. neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about
half a mile broad ; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present sub.
sistomna.

.-'l little. after noon, I found the see very calm, and the tide ebbed so far
out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. And here I
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that. if we had
kept on board, we had been all safe----Lhat is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to he left entirely destitute of all
comfort and company as I now was, This forced tears to my eyes again ;
but us there was little relief in that, I resolved. if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled oil" my clothes, for the weather was but to extremity. and
took the water. But when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still
greater to know how to get on board 3 for, as she lay aground, and high out
of the water, there was nuihing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam
round her twice, and the second time I spied :1 small piece of rope, which
I wondered I did not see at first, hung,r down by the fore-chains so low, as

that with great difficulty i got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got
' 45
up into the fumeastlo of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged,
and had a great deal of water in her hold; but that she lay so on the side
of abank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon
the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By this means all hm
quarter was free. and all that was in that'part was dry; for you may be

 

cum]: mm [m m wane): I"! in roman:

sure my lil'St work was to search, and to see what was spoiled and what
was free. And, fil'SL, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry and
untouched by Llie water, and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the
breed-romn, and filled my pockets with biscuit, and out it as I went about
other things, for I had no time (o lose. I also found some rum in the great

cabin, of which I took a large drum, and which I had, indeed, need enough
49 H
of to spirit me for what- waa before me. Now I wanted nothing but a
boat to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would he very
necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for wh. t was not to be had; and
this extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and
two or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship :
I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them over-
board as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that
they might not drive away. "Then this was done, I went down the ship's
side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together at both ends,
as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces
of plank upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it very well,
but that it was not able to bear any greatnveight, the pieces being too light.
So I went to work, and with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-mast into
three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and
pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me
to go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another
occasion. '-

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weighty. My
next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon
it from the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering this. I first
laid all the plank or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, 1 first got three of the seamen's chests, which I
had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft ; the
first of these I filled with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of' dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little
remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls which
we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed There had been
some barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappointment, I found
afterwards that the rats had eaten or Spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found
several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial
waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack. These 1 stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for
them. While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very
calm; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which
I had left on the shore, upon the sand, swim away As for my brooches,
which were only linen, and opemknee'd, I swam on board in them and my

stockings. However, this set me on rummaging for clothes, of which I
60
found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had
other things which my eye was more upon--as, first, tools to work with
on shore. And it was after long searching that I found out the carpenter's
cheat, which was, indeed, a. very useful prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship-load of gold would have been at that time. I got it down to my

  

causal: um xzfl'o 'nlx mlchsru.

raft, whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew in
general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two
very good fowling-pieces in the grout. cabin, and two pistols. These I
secured first, with some powder-horns and a, small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I knew there were _tln-ee barrels of powder in the ship, but,

knew not Where our gunner had stowed them; but with much seam}: I
51
lb'und them, two of then: dry and good, the third had taken water. Those
two I got to my 11xft,with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty
well fwighted, and began to think how 1 should get to shore with them,
having neither sail, oar. nor rudder; and the least cap-full of wind would
have overset all my navigation.

I hurl three encouragements: lat, a. smooth, calm sea ; 2ndly, the tide
rising, and set-ting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little wind there was blew
me towards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars
belonging to the boat--and, besides the tools which were in the chest, I
found two saws, an axe, and a hammer: with this cargo I put to sea. For
a mile, or thereahouts, my mft went very well, only that I found it drive
a little distant from the place where ,1 had landed before: by which I

my
a.
perceived that there was some indmft of the water, and consequently, I
hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might make use of as a
port to get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it- wue There appeared before me a little opening oi
the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided
my raft, as well as I could,'m keep in the middle of the stream.

 

caveats In" ls "mum ups".

But here I had like to have suffered a. second shipwreck, which, if I had,
I think, verily, would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the
coast, my ran. ran aground at one end of it upon a. shoal, and not being
aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cango had
slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I

did my utmost, by setting my back gains"; the chests, to keep them in their
53
places, but could not thrust oh" the raft with all my strength; neither durst
I stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with all my
might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising
of the water brought me a. little more upon a level; and, a little after, the
water still risig, my raft floated again, and I thrust her or? with the oar I
had into the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself
in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current
of tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to
' shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river: hoping, in,
time, to see some ship at son, and therefore resolved to place myself as near
the coast as I could.

At length I spied a. little cove on the right shore of the creek, to
which, with great pain and diflioulty, I guided my raft, and at last got
so near, that, reaching ground with my our, 1 could thrust her directly
in. But here 1 had like to have dipped all my cargo into the see again;
for that shore lying pretty steep--that is to say, sloping--there was no
place to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would
lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger
my cargo again. All that l could do, was to wait till the tide was at
the highest, keeping the raft with my car like an anchor, to hold the
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which 1 expected
the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I found water
enough--for my raft drew about a. foot of water--l thrust her on upon
that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking
my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side, near one end,
and one on the other side, near the other end; and thus I lay till the
water ehbed away, and left. my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek 9. proper place
for my habitation. and where to stow my goods to secure them from
whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the
continent or on an island; whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether
in danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hill not above a mile
from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
.ovcrtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward
I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn
of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of
that hill, where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got to the

top. I saw my fate, to my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island
M
environed every way with the see: no land to be seen except some rocks,
which lay a great way off; and two small islands, less than this, which
lay about three leagues to the west

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good reason to bclicve, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom,
however, I saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds; neither when I killed them could I tell. what was fit for
food, and what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which
I saw sitting upon a. true on the side of a great wood. I believe it
was the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world.
I had no sooner fired, than from all parts of the wood there arose an
innumerable number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming
and crying, eind ever)r one according to his usual note, but not one of
them of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took
it to be a. kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it. but it bad
no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh was onion, and fit for
nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to
work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that
day. What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to
rest, for l was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some
wild beast might devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was
really no need for those fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the
chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of
but for that night's lodging. As for food, 1 yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I laid seen two or three creatures, like hares,
run out of the wood where I shot the fowl.

I. now began to consider that I might yet get a. great many things
out of the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some
of the rigging and soils, and such other things as might come to land;
and I resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible.
And as I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break
her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I had got
everything out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a council---
that is to say, in my thoughts--whether I should take back the raft;
but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as before, when the
tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from

65
my but, having nothing on but a chequered shirt, 0. pair of linen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.

1 got on bourd the ship as before. and prepared a second raft; and,
having had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor
loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful
to me; as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I found two or three bags full
of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a. dozen or two of hatchcts, and,
above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured,
together with several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two
or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven musketa,
another fowling-piccc, with some small quantity of powder more; a large
bagl'ul of small shot, and a. great roll of sheet-lead; but this last was so
heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find,
and a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with this I
loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very
great comfort.

I was under some apprehension, during my absence from the land,
that- at least my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I
came buck, I found no sign of any visitor; only there sat a. creature
like it wild cat, upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards
it, ran away it little distance, and then stood still. She sat vcrycom-
posed and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a
mind to be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but, as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did
she offer to stir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though,
by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great: however,
I spared her a. bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it,
.ond looked (as if pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more : so she marched off.

Having got my second cargo on shore,----tho'ugh I was fain to
open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were
too heavy, being large casks,--I went to work to make me a. little
tent, with the sail, and some poles which I cut for that purpose: and
into this tent I brought everything that. I know would spoil either with
rain or sun; and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle
round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man

or beast.
56or nosmson (meson I .

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some
boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading
one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head,
and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept
very quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, to fetch all those
things from the ship, and to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I
believe, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship sat
upright in that posture, I thought I ought. to get everything out of her that
I could: so every day at low water I went on board, and brought away
something or other; but particularly the third time I went, I brought away
as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine
I could get, with a piece of spare .41nvas, which was to mend the soils upon
occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away
all the sails first and last; only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and
bring as much at a time as I could, for they were no more useful to be sails,
but as more canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all, after I had

made five or six such voyages as these, and- thought 1 hell nothing more to
57 1
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with ;--I say, after all
this, I found a great hogsheurl of breed, three large runlets of rum, or
spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour: this was surprising
to me, because I had given over expecting any more provisions, except
wnat was spoiled by the water. T soon emptied the hogshead of the bread,
and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the soils, which I out out;
and, in a. word, I got all this safe on shore also.

The next day 1 made another voyage, and now, having plundered the
ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables.
Cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables
and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could get ; and having cut
down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything Ilcould, to
make a large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods, and came away.
But my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy,
and so overladen, that, after I had entered the little cove where I had
landed the rest of my goods, not being' able to guide it so handily as I did
the other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for
myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the share; but as to my cargo,
it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would
have been of great use to me: however, when the tide was out, I got most
of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite
labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a. work which fatigued
me very much After this, I went every day on board, and brought away
what I could get,

I had been new thirteen (lays on shore, and had been eleven times on
hoard the ship, in which time I had brought, away all that one pair of
hands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily,
had the calm 'weathcr held, I should have brought away the whole ship,
piece by piece But preparing the twelfth thin to go on board, I found the
Wind began to rise: however, at low water I went on board, and though I
thought I had rummaged the cabin so ell'octnolly, that nothing more could
be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I
found two or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with seine ten or 0.
dozen of good knives and forks: in another I found about thirty-six pounds
value in money--some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight,
some gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: " 0 drug z " said I, aloud,

"whet art thou good for? Thou art not worth to rue--no, not the taking

/

off the ground: one of those knives is worth all this heap: I have no
manner of use for thee--e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom,
as a. creature whose life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away; and, wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I
began to think of making another raft ; but while I was preparing this, I

found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a. quarter of an
59
hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that
it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind oil' shore; and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I
might not be able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly, I let myself
down into the water, and swam across the channel which lay between the
ship and the. sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the
weight of the things 1 had about me, and partly the roughness of the
water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water
it blew a storm.

But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth
about me, very secure. It blew very hard all night, and in the morning,
when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be seen! I was a little
surprised, but recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection, that I had
lost no time, nor "abated any diligence, to get everything out of her that
could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I
was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out
of her, except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed,
divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small
use to me

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against
either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the
island; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and
what kind of dwelling to make--whether I should make me a cave
in the earth, or a tent upon the earth; and,- in short, I resolved upon
both; the manner and description of which, it may not be improper to
give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement,
because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed
it would not be wholesome, and more particularly because there was
no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more healthy and more
convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would
be proper for me: let, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned;
2ndly, shelter from the heat V" the sun; 3rdly, security from ravenous
creatures, whether man or beast; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God
sent any ship in sight, 1 might not lose any advantage for my deliver-

ance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet
60
In search of a. place proper for this. I found a little plain on the
side of a rising hill, whose l'ront towards this little plain was steep as
a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.
01: the side of the rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way

 

causal rxsns sugar. :10le m "I: mm

in, like the entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really any
cave, or way into the rock at all.

On the flat of the green, just. before this hollow place, I resolved to
pitch my tent. This plain was not above a. hundred yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like 0. green before my door; and, at the end of it.
descended irregularly every way down into the 10w ground by the seal-side.

It was on the NATW. side of the hill; so that it was sheltered from the
a]
heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereohouts, which,
in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent I drew a holiicirclo before the hollow place,
which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter, from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into
the ground'till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two
rows did not stand above six inches from one another. _

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid
them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows
of stokes, up to the' top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against
them, about two feet and e half high, like a spur to a post ; and this fence
was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it. This
cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the
woods, bring them to the place, mid drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a. door, but by a short
ladder to go over the top 3 which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after
me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, us I thought, from all
the world, and consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I
could not have done; though, as it apneared afterwards, there was no need
of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my riches,
all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the account
above; and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me. from the rains, that
in one part of the year are very violent there, I made double, onc smaller
tent within, and one larger tent above it ; and covered the uppermost with
a large torpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on
shore, but in a. hammock, which was indeed a. very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would
spoil by the wet ; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the
entrance. which till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as I
said, by a. short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and
bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, I

bald them up within my fence, in the nature of 9 terrace, so that it raised
620P ROBINSON 030502.

the ground within abouto foot and a half; and thus I made me a. cave, just
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour and many days before all these things were
brought to perfection ; and. therefore, I must go back to some other things
which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after
I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that
a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a. sudden flash of lightning
happened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the eli'ect
of it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning, as T was with 8.
thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning itself--0 my
powder! My very heart sank within me when I thought that at one blast,
all my powder might be destroyed ; on which, not my defence only, but the
providing my food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so
anxious about my own danger, though, had the powder took fire, 1 should
never have known who had hurt me,

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over,
I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself to
make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a, little and a
little in a. parcel, in the-hope that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once -, and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to
make one part fire another. I finished. this work in about a. fortnight ; and
I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred and forty pounds
weight, was divided in not less than a. hundred parcels. .As to the barrel
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that; so I placed
it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen; and the rest I
hid up and down in holes among lhe rocks, so that no wet might come to it.
marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least
every day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill
anything fit for food ; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with what
the island produced The first time I went out, I presently discovered that
there were goats in the island, which was a grout satisfaction to me; but
then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy,
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most difficult thing in the
world to come at them; but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but,
I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened ; for after I had found
their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they

saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run
83
away, as in a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and 1
was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded,
that by the position of their optics, their sight- was so direct-ed downward,
that they did not readily see objects that were above them ; so afterwards,
I took this method--41 always climbed the rocks first, to get above them,
and then had frequently it fair mark.

The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat, which
had a little kid by her, which she gave. suck-to, which grieved me heartily ',
for, when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her, till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I curried the old one with me, upon
my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon which, I
laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, uud carried it over my
pale, in hopes to have bred it up lame; but it would not eat; so I was
forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great
while, for I ate sparingly, and savedmy provisions, my bread especially, as
much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to
provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and what. 1 did for that,
and also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I shell
give a full account of in its place ; but I must now give some little account
of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed,
were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for, as I was not cast away
upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a. violent storm, quite
out of the course of our intended voyage, end a great way, viz. some
hundreds of leagues, out. of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I
had great reason to consider it as a. determination of l-lem'en, that in this
desolate place, and in' this desolate manner, I should end my life The tears
would run pleutii'ully down my face. when I made these reflections; and
sometimes I would cxpostulute with myself why Providence should thus
completely ruin His creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable;
so without help, abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such in life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts,
and to reprove me ; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my
hand by the sen-side, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present
condition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way,

thus : " Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true ; but, prey remember,
64mums WALK-B DY rm: KIA-SIDE in onset mum-low

Whei'e are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you in the boat!
Where are the ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost? Why were
you singled out? Is it better to be here or there ?" And then I pointed to
the see. All evils are to he considered with the good that, is in them, and
with what worse attends them,

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my subsist,-
ence, and what would have been my case if it had not. happened (which was
a. hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the place Where she
first struck, and was driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all
these things out other ; what would have been my case, if I had been forced to
have lived in the condition in which I at first came on shore, without neces-
saries of life, or necessaries to supply and procure them? "Particularly,"

65 K
said I aloud (though to myself), " what should I have done without a gun,
without ammunition, Without any tools to make anything, or to work with,
without clothes, bedding. a. tent, or any manner of covering?" and that now
I had all those to sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
myself in such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition
was spent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without. any want,
as long as I lived ; for I considered from the beginning, how I would
provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time that was to
come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even after
my health and strength should decay.

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being
destroyed at one blast--I mean my powder being blown up by lightning;
and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened and
thundered, us I observed just now.

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a. seenc of silent
life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my account,
the 30th of September. when, in the manner as above said, I first sol. foot
upon this horrid island; when the sun, being to us in its autumnal equinox,
was almost. just over my head: for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be
in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line,

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for Want of books, and
pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath (lays; but to prevent this,
I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters, and making it into
n grout cross, 1 set up on the shore where I first landed, " I came on shore
here on the 30th of September. 1659."

Upon the sides of this square post. 1' out every day a, notch with. my
knife, and every seventh notch was as long again us the rest, and every first
day of the month, as long again as that long one; and thus I kept my
calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next place, We are to observe thul- among the many things which
I brought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above. mentioned,
I made'to it, 1 got several things of less value, but not at all less useful to
me, which I omitted setting down before ; as, in particular, pens, ink, and
paper, several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gnuner's, and carpenter's
keeping, three (1" four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,

perspectives, charts, and books of nafigation; all which I huddled together,
66
whether I might want them or no: also, I found three very good Bibles.
which came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also; and, among them, two or
three Popish prayer-hooks, and several other books, all which I carefully
seemed. And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a dog, and two
cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say something in its
place; for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped
out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went
on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years ;
I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could

 

011an am VP A you.

make up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not
do. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded
them to the utmost; and I shall show>>r that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I could not make
any ink by any means that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding
all that I had amassed together; and of these, ink was one; as also a spade,
pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread:
as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was

near a whole your before I had entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded
o7
my habitation The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well
lift, were a. long time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by
far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and
bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the
ground; for which purpose, I got a. heavy piece of Wood at first, but at last
bethought myself of one of the iron crows ; which, howevcr, though I found
it, made driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But
what need I have been concerned at the tedionsness of anything I had to
do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other employment.
if that had been over, at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the
island to seek for food7 which I did, more or less, every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances
I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not so
much to leave them to any that were to come alter inc--for I was likely to
have but few heirs--as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my mind: and as my reason began now to master my
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set
the good gainst the evil, that. 1 might have something to distinguish my
case from worse; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and creditor,
the comforts I enjoyed gainst the miseries I suffered, thus :--

sary things as will either supply my
wants or enable me to supply myself,

even as long as I live.

Upon the Whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there was scarce
any condition in the world so miserable but there was something negative or
something positive to be thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction,
from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world:
that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from, and to
set, in the description of good and evil, on the credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given
over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship--I say, giving over
these things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to
make things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation. which was a, tent under the side
of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; but I might
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of well up against it of turfs,
about two foot thick on the outside; and after some time (I think it was a
year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched
or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get, to keep
out the min; which 1 found at some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and
into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that
at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so
they took up all my place ; I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself
to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy
rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when I
found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, 1 Worked sideways, to the right
hand, into the rock ; and then, turning to the right again, worked quite out,

and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification
69 -
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back way to my tent
and to my storehouse, but gave me room to store my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I
found I most wanted, particularly a. chair and a table 3 for without these I
was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not
write or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure without a table: so
I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that. as reason is the sub-
stance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring everything
by reason, and by making the most rational judgment. of things, every man
may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool
in my life ; and yet, in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I found,
at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had
had tools. However, 1 made abundance of things, even without tools ; and
some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I
wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge
before me, and how it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it
to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree ; but this I he
no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time
and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board : but my time or
labour was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the first
place 3 and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on
my rail; from the ship. But when I had wrought out some boards as above,
I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on ;
and, in a word, to separate everything at large into their places, that 1 might
come easily at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang
my guns and all things that would hang up: so that, had my cave been
to be seen, it looked like a general migazine of all necessary things ; and I
had everything so ready, at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to
see all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of all necea
sa-ries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's
employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only
hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind ; and. my

journal would have been full of many dull things; for example, I must
70causal: won out 1'0 an to}: A BAH.

have said thus: "Sept. 30th.--After I had got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having first
vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which had got into my
stonmch, and recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore wringing my
hands and heating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying
out, 'I was undone, undone: ' till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down
on the ground to repose, but din-st not sleep, for fear of being devoured."

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got all
that I could out; of her, yet I could not fox-bent getting up to the top of ii
little mountain, and looked out to sea, in hopes of seeing a. ship; then fancy,
at a vast distance, I spied a. sail, please myself with the hopes of it,und then
after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and
weep like a. child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things in some measure. and having settled

my household stufi' and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
71
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal; of which I shall
here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars 0ch
again) as long as it lasted ; for having no more ink, I was forced to leave
it oil'.

THE JOURNAL.

September 30, 1659--1, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the oiling, come on shore on this
dismal, unfortunate island, which I called " The Island of Despair-N all
the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circum-
stances I was brought to; viz. I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon,
nor place to fly to; and, in despair of any relief, saw nothing but death
before rue--either that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by
savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the approach of night I
slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly, though it rained
all night. '

October L--In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had floated
with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer the island;
which, as it was some comfiu-t, on one hand--for, seeing her set upright,
and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might gel- on board,
and get some food mul necessaries out of her for my relief--so, on the other
hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined. if
we had all stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they
would not have been all drowned, as they Were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the
ship, to have curried us to some other part of the world. I spent greet port
of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at length, seeing the
ship almost dry, I went upon the send as near as i could, and then swam on
board. This day also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.

From the 1st of October to the 24th--All these days entirely spent in
many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought on
shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain also in the days, though
with some intervals of fair weather ; but it seems this was the rainy season.

Oct. 20.--I overset my unit, and all the goods I had got upon it ; but,
being in shoal writer, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many
of them when the tide was out.

Oct. 25.----It ruined all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;

during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
72
than before, and was no more to be seen, except the Wreck of her. and that
only at. low water. I spent this day in covering and securing the goods
which I had saved, that the ruin might not spoil them.

Oct. 2G.---l walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place to
fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night, I fixed upon 0. proper
place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment; which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to 30th, I Worked very hard in carrying nil my goods to
my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained exceedingly hard.

The 3lst, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to
see for some food, and discover the country; when I killed it she-gout, and
her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it would
not feed.

November 1,--I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the first
night; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing my
hammock upon.

.Nov. 2.-----l set- up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber
which made my rafts, and with them formed it fence round me, a. little
within the place I had marked out for my fortification.

Nov. 3--1 went, out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, which
were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a table

Nov. 4.----This morning I began to order my times of Work, of going out
with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain ; then
employed myself to work till about eleven o'clock 3 then eat what I had to
live on; and from twelve till two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
:xcessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The working
part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a. very sorry workman, though time and necessity made
me a. complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any
one else

Nov. 5.----This day, Went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed 9.
wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for noting ; every creature
that I killed I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming back by the
see-shore, I saw many sorts of sen--fowls, which I did not understand -, but
was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals, which, while

78 1,
I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and
escaped me for that time.

Nov. (ii--After my morning walk, 1 went to work with my table again,
and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned
to mend it.

Nov. "xi--Now it began to he settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th,
10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday), I took wholly up to
make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but
never to please me ; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces several
times.

Note--I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark
for them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. l3.-----This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and cooled
the with: but it; was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which frightened me dreadfully, for {our of my powder. As soon as it was
over, I resolved to separate my stock- of powder into as many little parcels
as possible, that it might not he in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16.~--These three days T. spent in making little square
chests, or boxes, which might hold about a. pound, or two pounds at most,
of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure
and remote from one another us possible. On one of these three days, I
killed a. large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.

Nov. l7.--This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to
make room for my further conveniency.

Note--Three things l wanted exceedingly for this work; viz. a pickaxe,
a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket-,- so I dosisted from my work, and
began to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As
for the pickexe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough,
though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel, or spade ; this was so
absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it ;
but what kind of one to make I knew not.

No>>. 18--The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that
wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call the iron-tree, for its ex-
ceeding hardness. 01' this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I
cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was
exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having no
other way, made me a. long while upon this machine, for I worked it

effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade ; the handle
74
exactly shaped like cum in England, only that the board pert having no
iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long; however, it
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but
never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long in making.

I was still deficient, for 1 Wanted a basket, or a wheelbarrow. A basket
I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker-warehot least, none yet found out; and as to a wheel-
barrow, l fancied I could make all but the wheel ; but that I had no notion
of -, neither did I know how to go about it; besides I had no possible way
to make the iron gndgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in ;
so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth which I dug out of
the cave, lmade me a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar
in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not so difficult to me as the
making the shovel; and yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I
made in vain to make a. wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days--I
mean always excepting my morning well: with my gun, which I seldom
failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home something fit to eat.

Nov. 23.---'.\ly other work having now stood still, because of my making
:hese tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day, as.
my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in Widening
and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods cominodiously.

Note--During all this time, I worked to make this room or cove
specious enough to accommodate me as a. warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen,
a (lining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the tent; except
that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I could
not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters,1enning against the
rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.

December l0.--l begun now to think my cave or vault finished, when on
a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and one side; so much that, in short, it frighted me,--
and not without reason, (on, for il' I had been under it, I had never wanted
a grove-digger. I had now a great deal of work to do over again, for I had
the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more importance, I had
the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come
down.

Dec. ll.----This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two

shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across
75
over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more posts up
with boards, in about a. week more I had the roof secured, and the. posts,
standing in rows, served rue for partitions to part off the house

Dec. 17.--From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up
nails on the posts, to hang everything up that could he hung up ; and new
I began to he in some order within doors.

Den. 20.--Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish
my house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my
\rictuals upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ; also, I made
me another table.

Dec. 2ah--Much rain all night and all duy. No stirring out

Dec. 25.----R3.ln all day.

Dec. 26. --No rain, and the earth much cooler than before and plensauter.

Dec. '77. --Killed 21 young goat, and lurned another so thut I caught it
and led it home 111 a string , when I had it at home, I bound and splintered
up its leg, which was broke.

N.B.--I book such care of it that it lived, and the leg grow well and as
strong as ever ; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon
the little green at my door, and would not. go away. This was the first
time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures. that
I might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.

Dec. :28, 29 30 31. --G1eut heats, and no breeze, so that there was no
stirring abroad, except in the e\-' ening. for food; this time I spent in putting
all my things' in order within doors.

Jan-nary 1 --V ery hot still. but I went abroad early and late with my
gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going further
into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I found there
were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at. ; how-
ever, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them (low 11.

Jan. 2--Accordingly, the next clay I went out with my dog, and set
him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the
dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.

c'er. 3.---I began my fence, or wall; \1-hich,heing still jealous of my
being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.

N B--This well being described before, I purposely omit what was said

being a halflcirele, from one place in the rock to another place, about eight
yards from it, the door of the cave being in the. centre behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days,
nay, sometimes weeks together; but T thoughtl should never be perfectly
secure. till this wall was finished; and it is source credible What inex-
pressible labour everything was done with, especially the bringing piles out-
of the woods, and driving them into the ground; for I made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double--knead, with a turf
wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not perceive anything like (L habitation;
and it: wns very well 1 did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very
remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day

when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks
77
of something or other to my advantage ; particularly, I found a kind of wild
pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a. tree, but rather as house--
pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured
to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew
away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing
to give them; however, I frequently found their nests, and get their young
ones, which were very good meat. And new, in the managing my house-
hold afl'airs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I thought at
first it was impossible for me to make; as, indeed, with some of them it
was; for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small
runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could never arrive at the capacity
of making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it; I could
neither put in the heads, or join the stoves so true to one another as to make
them hold water; so I gave that also over. In the next place, I was at a
great loss fer candles; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was
generitll)r by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the
lump of bees-wax with which I made candles in my African adventure;
but I had none of that now; the onl)r remedy I had was, that when I had
killed a. goat I saved the follow, and with a little dish made of clay, which
I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a
lamp ; and this gave me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle.
In the middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my things, I
found at little bag, which, we I hinted before, had been filled with corn for
the feeding of poultry--not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when
the ship came from Lisbon. The little remainder of corn that had been in
the bug was isll devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but
husks and dust; and being willing to have the bg for some other use
(I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning,
or some such use), I shook the husks of com out of it on one side of
my fortification, under the rock:

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw
this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereahouts, I
saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground, which
I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and
perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or
twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, ol' the same kind as

our European--nay, as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my
thoughts on this <<mansion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious l'oun~
dation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my head, nor had
entertained any sense of anything that had befallcu me, otherwise than as
chance, or, as we lightly say, what. pleases (Srod, Without so much as in--
quiring into the end of Providence in these things, or His order in governing
events for the world. But after 1 saw barley grow there, in a. climate
which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I know not how
it came there, it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God had
miraculously caused Hi3 grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and
that in was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable

place.
79
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I
began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon
my account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it,
still, all along by the side of the. rock, some other straggling stalks, which
proved to be stalks of rice, and which 1 knew, because I had seen it grow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my
support, but, not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all over
that part of the island where I had been before, peering in every comer, and
under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any. At last it.
occurred to my thoughts, that I shook u. hug of chickens' most out- in that
place; and then the wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my
religious tlrarrkl'ulness to God's providence began to abate, too, upon the
dismvering that all this was nothing but what was common; though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence,
as if it. had been miraculous ; for it was really the work of Providence to
me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should
remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been
dropped from heaven; as also, that 1 should throw it out in that particular
place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately ;
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at that time, it had been burnt
up and destroyed,

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their season,
which was about the end of June ; and, laying up every corn, I resolved to
sow them all again, hoping, in time, to have some quantity, sullirzient to
supply me with bread But it was not till the fourth year that I could
allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly,
as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost all. that I sowed the first
season, by not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just: before the dry
season, so that it. never come up at all, at least not as it would have done;
of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice,
which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to the same
purpose--to make rrre bread, or- rather food; for I found ways to cool: it
without baking. though I did that also after some time.

But to return to my Journal :--

I worked excessive hard those three or four- months, to get my wall
done -, and the 14th of April, I closed it up, cont-firing to go into it, not. by

80 -
a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the
outside of my habitation

April 16,--l finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top,
and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside. This was a
complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could
come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next duy after this wall was finished. I had almost had all my
labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus :----.-'ls I
was busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave,
l was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for,
all on a. sudden, 1 found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of
my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts
I hurl set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily
scared; but thought nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking
that the top of my cave Wits fallen in, as some of it had done before: and
for four I should he buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not
thinking myself snfe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces
of the hill, which I expected might roll down upon me. 1 had no sooner
stepped dowu upon the firm ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible
earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight
minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth ; and a
great piece of the top of a rock which stood about half u mile from me
next the sen fell down, with such a. terrible noise as I never heard in all
my life. I perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it;
and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so much twinned with the thing itself, having never felt the like,
nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupitied;
and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed
at see; but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and
rousing me from the stupifieil condition I was in, filled me with horror; and
Ithought of nothing then but. the hill falling upon my tent and all my
household goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul
within me a. second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I began
to take coinage 3 and yet I had not heart enough to go over my well again,
for fear of being buried alive, but set still upon the ground greatly east

down and diseonsolate, not knowing what to (10' All this while, I had not
81 M
the least serious religious thought; nothing but the common "Lord have
mercy upon mo ! " and when it was over, that wont away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it
would min. Soon after that, the wind arose by little and little, so that in
less than half an hour it blow o most dreadful hurricane, the sea. was all on
a. sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was covered with
the breach of the water; the. trons were torn up by the roots ; and a. terrible
storm it was. This held about three hours, and then begun to abate; und
in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All this
while T. sat upon the ground, very much terrified and dejected; when on a
sudden it came inLo my thoughts, that these winds und rain hcing tho con-
sequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and
I might venture into my cave again. With this thought, my spiiits began
to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat- down
in my tout. But the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down with it; and T was forced to go into my cave, though very much
afraid and imeasy, for four it should fall on my head. This violent rain
forced me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification,
like a sink, to let the water go out, which would. else have flooded my cave
After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks
of the earthquake follow, I began to he more composed. And now, to support
my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and
took a. small sup of rum ; which, however, I did then and always very spaih
ingly, knowing I could have no more when that. was gone It continued
raining all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I could not
stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think of what I
had host do; concluding, that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would he no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building a.
little hut in an open place, which I might. surround with a wall, as I had
done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men; for 1 con-
cluded if I stayed who're I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive.

With these thoughts. I resolved to remove my tent from the place where
ii. stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill ;. and which,
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent; and I
spent. the two next (lays, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving

, where and how to remove my habitat-ion. The fear of being swallowed up

alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet. the apprehension of
82m can "Luxu ll. mum: Hum; ms lac":

lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it; but still, when I
looked about, and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove.
In the mean time, it occurred to me that it. would require a vast deal of time
for me to do this, and that; I must be contented to venture where I was, till
I had formed a. camp for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it.
So with this resolution T composed myself for a time, and resolved that. I
would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables,
8m in a. circle, as before, and set my tent up in it, when it. was finished;
but that I would venture to stay when: I was till it was finished, and fit to
move. This was the 21512

April 22.--The next morning I began to consider of means to put this
83
resolve into execution; but I was at a. great loss about. my tools. I had
thrcc large axes, and abundance of hotchcts (for we carried the. hatchets for
traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a grind-
stone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much
thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a. grand point of politics,
or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length, I contrived a
wheel with a, string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty.

Note--T had never seen any such thing in England, or at least not to
take notice how it was done, though since I have observed it is very
common there; besides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy.
This machine cost. me a. full week's work to bring it to perfection.

April 28, 29,--Thcsc two whole. days I took up in grinding my tools,
my machine for turning my griudstone performing very well

April 80,--Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now
I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuitcakc a. day, which
made my heart very heavy.

May 1.--~In the morning, looking towards Lhe sea-side, the tide being
low, 1 saw something lic on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked
like a. cask; when i came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three
pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane ; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which
was driven on shore, and soon found it was it barrel of gunpowder; but it
had taken water, and the powder was eaked as hard as a stone: however, I
rolled it firrthcr on shore for the present, and went on upon the stands, as
near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.

When I came. down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. The
forecast-1c, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet,
and the stern, which was broke in picccs and parted from the rest by the
force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it werc,
up, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that side
next her stern, that: w hnreas there was a. great place of water before, so that
I could not conic within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming,
I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised
with this at first, but soon concluded it must he done by the earthquake;

and as by this violence the ship was more broke open than formerly, so
84
many things come daily on shore, which the sea. had loosened, and which
the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my
habitation, and l busied myself mightily, that day especially, in searching,
whether I could make any way into the ship ; but. I found nothing was to
be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with
sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to
pull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that everything.
I could get from her would be of some use or other to me.

May 3.--1'began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through,
which I thought. held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and
when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from
the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give
over for that time.

Mag] 'hr--I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst. eat of, till
I was Weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a young
dolphin. I had niadc inc 3 long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks ;
yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I
dried in the sun, and ate them dn.

May 5.--Workcd on the wreck; out another beam asunder, and brought
three great fir planks oii' from the. decks, which I tied together, and made to
float. on shore when the tide of flood came on.

May 6.--Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her, and
other pieces of iron-work. Worked very hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thoughts of givm it over.

May 7.--'Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but
found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut;
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold
lay so open that I could see into it; but it was almost full of water
and sand.

May 8.--Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the
dock, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. i left the iron crow
in the wreck for next day.

May 9,--Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body
of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crew, but.
could not break them up. I felt- also a roll of English lead, and could stir-

it. but it was too heavy to remove.
86
May 10--14.-- Vent every day to the wreck; and got a great many
pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundredweight
of iron.

May 15,--1 carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a. piece oil'
the roll of lead, by placing the edge 'of one huwliet, and driving it with the
other; but as it lay about a foot and a. half in the water, 1 could not make
any blow to drive the hatchet. '

May 16.--It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared mom
broken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods, to get
pigeons for food, Unit the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day.

May 17.--~I Saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great
distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were, and
found it wns a, piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.

May 2h--Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with
hard labour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first
blowing tide several cusks floated out, and two of the soamen's chests ; but
the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces
of timber, and a. hogshead, which had some Brazil pork init; but the salt
water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the
15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which i always
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up,
that T might- be ready when it was ehbed out; and by this time I had got
timber and plank and iron-work enough to have built a good boot, if I
had known how; and also I got, at several times and in several pieces,
nexu- one hunrhedweighl. of the sheet-lead. ,

J2me 16.--Going down to the sea-side, I found a. large tortoise, or turtle.
This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not
any defect- of the place, or soiwcity; for bad I happened to be on the other
side of the island, I might have haul hundreds of them every day, as I found
after-words; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

J mw 17.----I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threesome eggs;
and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and pleasant that
ever I tested in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I
landed in this horrid place.

J1me 18.--Ruinerl all day, and I stayed within. - I thought, at this time,
the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly; which I knew was not usual
in that latitude.

June ISL--Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.

somush: name 10 an In.

June 20.--No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.

J um 2].--Very ill; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions 01
my sad condition--to be sick, and no help. Frayed to God, for the first
time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why, my
thoughts being all confused.

June '22.----A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of sickness.

June 23.---Very had again; cold and shivering, and thou a violent
neadnche.

J1me 24,--Much better.

me 25.--An ugue very violent: the fit held me goven hours ; cold fit,
and hot, with faint sweats after it.

.lzme 26.----Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but

found myself very weak. However, l killed a she-goat, and with much
87
difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and are. I would fain have
stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.

J1me: '27.---The ague again so violent that I lay arbed all day, and
neither ate nor drunk. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had
not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. Frayed to
God again, but was light--headed; and when I was not, I Was so ignorant
that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, " lord, look upon me!
Lord, pity me E Lord, have mercy upon me 5 " I suppose I did nothing else
for two or three hours; till, the fit wearing ofi', I fell asleep, and did not
wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed,
but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no water in my habita-
tion, 1 was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In this
second sleep, I had this terrible dream :----I thought that I was sitting on the
ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after
the earthquake, and that. 1 saw a man descend from a great- blaek cloud, in
n bright. flame of fire, and light. upon the ground. He was all over as bright
as a flame, so that I could but just hear to look towards him ; his counte-
nance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe.
When he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,
just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my
apprehension, as if it; had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner
landed upon the earth. but. he moved forward towards me, with a long spear
or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground,
at some distance, he spoke to me--or I heard a voice so terrible that it is
impossible to express the terror of it. All that I can say I understood, was
this z--"Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now
thou shalt. die ; "--at which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that was
in his hand to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be
able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision. I mean, that
even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors Nor is it any
more possible to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when
I awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge What I had received by the good
instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for
eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation with none
but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. 1 do

not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought that so much as
as
tended either to looking upwards towards God, or'inwards towards a reflec~
tion upon my own ways ; but a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of
good, or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all
that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common
sailors can be supposed to be; not having the least sense, either of the fear
of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to God, in deliverance.

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more
easily believed, when I shell add, that through all the variety of miseries
that had to this day hefallen me, I never had so much as one thought of it
being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin. M y
rebellious behaviour against my father--or my present sins, which were
great--or so much as u punishment for the general course of my wicked
life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa,
I never had so much as one thought of what would become of me, or one
wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures
as cruel savages. But I wus merely thoughtless of a. God or 3 Providence,
acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of
common sense only, and, indeed, hardly that. When I was delivered and
taken up at sea by the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, us well as charitably, I had not the least thankfnlness in
my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of
drowning, on this island, I was us for from remorse, or looking on it as a
judgment. I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and
born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship's crew
drowned. and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have
come. up to true thankfulness ; but it ended where it b%an, in a mere com-
mon flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least
reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved
me, and had singled me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed,
or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful unto me liven just
the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are
got sefc ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of
punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over; and all the rest of my life
was like it Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made

sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the
so a
reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as
soon as I saw but a prospect of living. and that I should not starve and
perish for hunger, all the sense of my all'liotion wore ofi' ; and I began to be
very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and
supply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a
judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were
thoughts which very seldom entered my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had, at first,
some little influence upon me, and bman to afi'ect me with seriousness, or
long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as eve
that part of the thought was removed, all the impression that was raised
from it were off also, as I have noted already. Even the earthquake, though
nothing could he more terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing
to the invisible power which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was
the first fright over, but the impro; 'on it had made went off also. I had no
more sense of God, or His judgments--much less of the present affliction of
my circumstances being from His hand--than if I had. been in the most
prosperous condition of life. But now, when I began to be sick, and a
leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place itself before me ; when
my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature
was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so
long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in
which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice
of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so
vindictive a. manner. These reflections oppressed me for the second or
third day of my distemper; and in the violence. as well of the. lever as of
the dreadful reproiwlics of my conscience, extorted some words from me
like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended
with desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of more fright. and
distress My thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon my mind.
and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours into
my head with the mere apprehension; and in these hurries ol' my soul, I
knew not. what. my tongue might express. But it was rather exclamation,

the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a. good while.
In this interval. the good advice of my father came to my mind, and

presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story,

But to return to my J ournul :'

J1me 28.---I[aving been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had,
and the fit being entirely oil', I got up ; and though the fright and terror of
my dream was very great, yet I considered that the lit of the ague would
return again the next day, and now was my time to get something to refresh
and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did, I filled
a large square. case--bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bed; and to take off the chill or oguish disposition of the water, I put
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I
got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat
very little. I walked about, but was very weak, and withal very sad and
heax-juhearted under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return
of my distemper the. next day. At night, I made my supper of three of the
turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and "eat, as we call it, in the shell,
and this was the first hit of moot I had ever asked God's blessing to, that I
could remember, in my whole life. After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but
found myself so weak, that I could hardly carry a. gun, for I never went out
without that; so I went but a little way, and set down upon the ground,
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As 1 set here. some such thoughts as these occurred to me 2--Whot
is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much? Whenoc is it pro~
duced? And what am I, and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal? "hence are we? Sure we are all made. by some secret pchr,
who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky, And who is that? Then it
followed most naturally, it is God that has made all. IVcll, but then, it
came on strangely, if God has made all these things, He guides and governs
them all, and all things that concern them ; for the power that could make
all things must certainly have power to guide and direct them, If so, nothing
can happen in the great circuit of His works, either without His knowledge
or appointment.

And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am
here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without
His appointment, He has appointed all this to befal me, Nothing occurred
to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that God had
appointed all this to befal me; that I was brought into this miserable
circumstance by His direction, He having the sole power, not of me only,

but of everything that happened in the world. Immediately it followed,--
92
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to he thus used? My
conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had blusphemcd,
and methought it spoke to me like a voice--" Wretch! dost time ask what
thou hast done? Look back upon a. dreadful mis3pent life, and ask thyself
whet thou hast not done? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago do
stroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the
fight when the ship was taken by the Sztllee inun-of-werz devoured by the
wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned here, when all the crew
perished but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I clone?" I was struck
dumb with these reflect-ions, as one astonished, and had not a word to say,
--no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to
my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but
my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I
set down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now,
as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much.
it occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians take no physio but their
tobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in
one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was green, and
not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest- I found 1). euro
both for soul and body. I opened the ohest. and found What I looked for,
the tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one
of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this time I had not
found leisure or inclination to look into. I say, I took it out, and brought
both that and the tobacco with me to the table. What use to make of the
tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no;
but. 1 tried several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit
one way or other. 1 first took a. piece of leaf, and chewed it in my month,
which, indeed, at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco being green
and strong, and that I had not been much used to. Then I took some and
steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it
when I lay down; and, lastly, l burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held
my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the
heat, as almost for suffocation. In the interval of this operation, I took up
the Bible, and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with
the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the
book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these, "Call on me

in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
93
These words were very apt to my case; and made some impression upon my
thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so In uch as they did ather-
wards; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say, to
me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of things,
than I began to say, as the children of Israel did when they were promised
flesh to eat, " Cu." God spread a table in the wilderness?" so T began to say,
"Can God himself deliver me from this place?" And 9.5 it was not fox

imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the
tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that I could scarcely
get it down ; immediately upon this I went to bed. I found presently it flew.
up into my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no
more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the
afternoon the next day--nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion that I slept
all the next day and night, and till almost three the day after; for other-
wise, I know not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days
of the week, as it appeared some years after I had done; for if I had lost
it by crossing and recrosslng the Line, I should have lost more than one
day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way,
Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself
exceedingly refresher], and my spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up
I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better, for I was
hungry; and, in short, I had no lit the next day, but continued much aitcrcd
for the better. This was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun,
but did not care to travel too for. I killed it sea--fowl or two, something like
a brand goose, and brought them home; but was not very forward to eat
them; so I eat some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. rl'his
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day
before-4M tobacco steeped in ruin ; only 'I did not take so much as before,
nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke ; however,
I was not so well the next. day, which was the first of July, as I hoped I
should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not
much.

July 2.--I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and dosed myself
with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.

J 1113/ 3.----I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not. recover my
full strength for some weeks after. While I was Ihus gathering slrvnglln my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, " I will deliver thee ;" and the
impossibility of my deliverance In}7 much upon my mind, in her oi" my ever
expecting it ; but as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it
occurred to my mind that I ported so much upon my deliverance from the
main afiiiction, that I disregarded the deliverance 1 had received, mid l was
as it: were made. to ask myself such questions as these; viz. : IIch I not
been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness--from the most distressed

condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me? and what notice
95
had I taken of it? Had I done my part? God had delivered me, but I had
not glorified Him---that is to soy, 1 had not owned and been thankful for
that as a. deliverance ; and how could I expect greater deliverance? This
touched my heart very much ; and immediately I knelt down, and give God
thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness.

July =1.--In the morning, I took the Bible ; and, beginning at the New
Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a
while every mun-ning and every night; not tying myself to the number of
chapters, but long as my thoughts should eigage me. It was not long after
I set seriously to this work, till I found my heart more deeply and sincerely
afflicted with the wickedness of my past life. The impression of my dream
revived ; and the words, " All these things have not brought thee to
repentance," run seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly beging of God
to give me repentunee, when it happened providontiully, the very day, that,
reading the Scripture, I come to these words : " He is exalted (L Prince and
a Saviour, to give repentance and to give remission." I threw down the
book ; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind
of exstesy ofjoy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus, thou son of David ! Jesus, thou
exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repent-once 2" This was the first time
I could suy, in the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life;
for now I prayed with u sense of my condition, and a true scripture view of
hope, founded on the encouragement of tho W'ord of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would hem- me

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call on me, and
1 will deliver thee," in a different sense from What I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of anything being called deliverance, but my being
delivered from the captivity I was in ; for though I was indeed at large. in
the place, yet the island was certainly a. prison to me, and that in the worse
sense in the world. But now I learned to take it in another sense : now I
looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared so
dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load
of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was
nothing; I did not so much us pray to be delivered from it, or think of it ;
it was all of no consideration, in comparison to this And I add this part
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true
sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing
than deliverance from affliction).

But, leaving this part, I return to my Journal :--
96came: PRAVE.

My condmon vegan now to be, though not less miserable as to my way
of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by
a constant reading the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher
nntm'c, I had a great- deal of comfort. Within, which, till now, I knew nothing
of ; also, my health and strength returned, I bestirrcd myself to furnish
myself with everything that I wanted, and make my way of living as
regular as I could.

97 o
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking
about with my gun in my hand, a little and a. little at. a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness ; for it is hardly to he
imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The appli-
cation which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never
cured an ague before ; neither can I recommend it to any to practise, by this
experiment: and though it did carry ofl' the fit, yet it rather contributed to
weakening me ; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for
some time. I learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad
in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that. could
be, especially in those ruins which ezune attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind; for as the rain which came in the dry season was almost
always accompanied with such storms, so I found that. rain was much more
dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All possibility
of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;
and I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set. foot upon that place.
Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had
a. grout desire to make a more perfect. discovery of the island, and to see
whut other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey
of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought
my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up, that. the tide
did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than e little brook of
running Witter, very fresh and good; but. this being the dry season, them
was hardly any water in some parts of it--ut least, not enough to run in any
stream, so as. it could be perceived. On the banks of this brook, I found
many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where
the water, as might he supposed, never overilowed, I found a. great deal of
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk. There were
divers other plants, which I haul no notion of or understanding about, that
might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not lind out. I
searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make
their bread of, but. I, could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did
not understand them. 1 saw several sugar-canes, hut wild, and, for want of
cultivation, imperfect, I contented myself with these discoveries for this

time, and mine hunk, musing with myself what course I might take-to know
us
the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which 1 should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion -, for, in short, I had made so
little observation while I was in the Bmzils, that I know little of the plants
in the field ; at least, very little. that might serve me to any purpose now in
my (listless.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the some way again; and, after going
something further than Iliad gone the day before, I found the. brook and
suvannahs cease, and the country become mom woody than before. In this
part, I found dill'ereut fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground, in gran abundance, and gmpes upon the trees. The vines had
spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were Just now in
their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery. and l.
was exeeeding glad of them; but I was warned by my experience to eat
sparingly of them. remembering that when l was ashore in Barbary, the
eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there,
by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent use for
these grapes ; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them
as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they
were, wholesome and ngreeable to eat when no grapes could he had.

1 spent all that evening there, and wont not back to my habitation;
which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from home.
In the ught, I took my first contrivance, and got- up in a tree, where I
slept well; and the next. morning proceeded upon my discovery. travelling
nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still
due north, with a. ridge of hills on the south and north side of me. At the
end of this march, I came to an opening, where the country seemed to
descend to the. west; and a. little spring of fresh water, which issued out of
the side of the hill. by me, run the. other way, that is, due east; and the
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a
constant verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a. planted garden.
I descended a. little on the side of that delicious vale surveying it-with a
secret- kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to
think that, this was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this
country indefeasibly, and had a. right of possession ; and, if I could convey
it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw hero abundance of covert-trees, orange, and lemon. and
citron-trees ; but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then.
However, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but

99
very wholesome ; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which
made. it very'wholeaome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now I had
business enough, to gather and carry home ; and I resolved to lay up a. store
as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season,
which I knew was approaching; In order to do this, I gathered a great heap
of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of
limes and lemons in another place; and taking a {cw of each with me, I
travelled horuewards; resolving to come gain, and bring a bag or sack,
or what I could make, to carry the rest home, Accordingly, having spent
three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and
my cave) ; but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled -, the richness of
the fruit. and the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised
them, they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were good,
but I could bring but a. few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small
bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming to my
heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, to find
them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some
there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I concluded there were
some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this ; but what they were
I knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a suit, but that one way they would be
destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight,
I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry
in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as
I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great
pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situa-
tion; the security from storms on that side the water, and the wood: and
concluded that I had pitched upon a. place to fix my abode, which was by
far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as where
now 1 was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for
some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came to
a nearer view of it, I considered that l was now by the sea-side, where it

was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage; and,
100 -(:11th run: A no)": PAR'ncDuR aulwm' or 1'"! llama

by the same ill {ate that brought me hither, might bring some othe:
unhappy matches to the same place ; and though it was scarce probable that
any such thing should ever happen; yet to inclose myself among the hills

and woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to
101
render such an affair not onlv improbable, but impossible; and that there

I began to be stmitcuod for fluid : but venturing out twice, I Ollt.' day killed

which was :'a treat to me, and my fond was regulated thus :--1 nlo a bunch

my dinner, broiled; for, to my great. misfortune, i had no vessel to boil or
stew anything; and two or three. of the tux-Lids eggs for my supper.

During this confinement, in my cover by the rain, 1 worked daily two or
three. hours .. enlarging my cave, and by degrees u-'nr'xod it on towards one

But I was not. perfectly easy at. lying so open; for, as I had managed

exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and yet 1 could not
perceive that. there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that: I
had yet seen upon the island being a goal.

Sept. 3(t.---I was now come to the ruihappy anniversary of my landing.
I cast. up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore. three
hundred and sixtr'five days. 1 kept. this day as a solemn fast. setting it
apart for religious exercise, prostruting myself on the ground with the most
serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his righteous
judgments upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me through Jesus
Chris-L; and not having tasted the least rct'roslnneut for twelve hours, even
till the going down of the sun, 1 then eat a biscuit-coke and :1. hunch of
grapes, and went to bod, finishing the day as I hogan it. I had all this
timc observed no SahhnLtnday; for as at first I had no sense of religion
upon my mind, I had, after some. time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by
making longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not;
reall)r know what any of the days were; but now, huving cost up the. days
as above, 1 found I had been there a year; so 1 divided it into weeks, and
set apart. every seventh day for :1. Sabbath; though I found at the end of
my :iccount, 1 had lost- n day or two in my reckoning. A little after this,
my ink begun to fail me, and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly,
and to write down only the moat romnrkable events of my life, Without:
continuing a daily memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to

me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly;
103
but I bought all my experience before I had it. and this I am going to
relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.

I have mentioned that T had saved the few ears of barley and rice,
which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves,
and I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of
barley; and now I thought it a. proper time to sow it, after the rains, the
sun being in its southern position, going from me Accordingly, I dug up
a piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred
to my thoughts that. 1 would not sow it all at first, because I did not know
when was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed,
leaving about a handful of each, It was a great comfort to me afterwards
that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to anything:
for the dry months following, the earth having had no rain after the seed
was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all
till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but
newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined
was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another
trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the
rest of my seed in February, a. little before the vernal equinox; and this
having the rainy months of Mamh and April to water it, sprung up very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the seed left
only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at
last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peek of each kind. But
by this experiment I was made master of my business, and knew exactly
when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed times,
and two harvests every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a. little discovery, which was of
use to me alterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather
begun to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up
the country to my bower, where, though I had not. been some months, yet I
found all things just as I left them The circle or double hedge that I had
made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I bud cut out of
some trees that grew thereebouts, were all shot out and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after
lapping its head. I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes
were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young

trees grow: and I pruned them, and led them up to-grow as much alike as
10;
1 could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in
three years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five
yards in dinincter, yet the trees, for such I might now call them,q soon
covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the
dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge like this, in e semi-circle round my wall (I mean that of
my first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew
presently, and were at first a. fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found now that the seasons of the your might generally be divided,
not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and
the dry seasons, which were generally thus :--

The half of February, the whole of March, and the half of April--rainy,
the sun being then on or near the equinox.

The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half of
August--dry, the sun being then to the north of the Line,

The half 01' August, the whole of September, and the half of October--
rainy, the sun being then come back.

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and January.
and the hall' of February~dry, the sun being then to the south of
the Line. '

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds
happened to blow, but this was the general observation 1 made. After
I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the
min, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might
not be obliged to go out, and I set within doors as much as possible
during the wet months. This time I found much employment, and very
suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for many things which
I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard lab0ur and constant
application; particularly I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but
all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they Would
do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I
was a. boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's, in
the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-were ; and
being, as boys usually are, very oflicions to help, and a great observer
of the manner in which they worked those things, and sometimes lending

a hand, I had by these menus full knowledge of the methods of it, and

decayed, I made more, especially stiong deep baskets 1.0 place my corn in,
instead of sucks, when I should come to have any quantity 01' it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it,
I bestirred myself to sou, if possible, how 1.0 supply two wants. I had no
vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which were
almost. full of rum, and some glass bottles--some of the common size, and
others which were case-bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits, &c.
I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I
saved out. of the ship, and which was too big for such as I desired it, fix.
to make broth, and stew 11 bit of 1110111. by itself. The second thing 1 fain
would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible to me to make
one; however, I found a. contrivanee for that, too, at. last. I employed
myself in planting my second rows 01' stokes or piles, and in this wicker-
worldng all the summer or dry season, when another business took me up
more time than it could be imagined I could spam.

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to sec the whole island, and
that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I
now resolved to travel quite across to the semshore on that side ; so, taking
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a. larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, with two biscuit cakes and a. grout. bunch of raisins in my pouch
for my store, I began my journey. When I had passed the vale where my
bower stood, as above, I came within view of the. sea to the west, and it

being a very clear day, I fairly descried land--whether an island or a.
106(11th WEIR A 80' wxmnu Tull yuan-m AT WORK

continent I could not. tell; but it lay very high, extending from the W.
to the W.S,W. at a. very great distance; by my guess, it could not be
less than fifteen or twenty leagues OH.

I could not tell what pm of the world this might be, otherwise than
that I knew it. must be part of America, and, as I concluded, by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all
inhabited by savges, where, if I had landed, I had been in a wotse con-
dition than I was now ;, and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began new to own and to believe ordered everything
for the best; I say I quiet/ed my mind with this, and left off afflicting
myself with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some thought upon this afi'air, I considered that if this
107
land was the Spanish coast, T should certainly, one time or other. see some
vessel pass or rcpass one way or other; but if not, then it was the savage
coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are found the worst
of savages; for they are oanuibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder
and ddvour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward. I found
that side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine--the
open or savanuah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of
very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible, to have kept it- to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I
did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down
with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but it was some
years before I could make him speak ; however, at- last, I taught him to call
'me by name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though it he
a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low
grounds hams (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed
greatly from all the other kinds 'I had met with, nor could I satisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be
ventureus, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good, too,
especially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise,
which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall-market could not have furnished
a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and though my
case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness that I
was not driven to any extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even
to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or
thereahouts; but I took so many turns and returns to see what discoveries
I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I resolved
to sit down all night; and then I either ieposed myself in a tree, or
surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either
from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at me
without waking me.

As soon as 1 came to the sea--shore, I was surprised to see that>> I had
taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed, the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I had
found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite number of

fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I had not
' 108
seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the
names of, except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my
powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on ; and though there were many goats here, more
than on my side the island, yet. it was, with much more difficulty that I
could come near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than when I was on the hills.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasantcr than mine; but
yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my
habitation it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here
to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I travelled
along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles,
and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded
I would go home again, and that the next journey I took should be on the
other side of the island east from my dwelling, and so round till I came to
my post again. -

1 took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I ooul
easily keep all the island so much in my view. than. I could not miss finding
my inst dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself mistaken,
for, being come about two or three miles, 1 found myself descended into a
very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with
wood, that I could not see which was my way by any direction but that
of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun
at that time of the (lay. It happened, to my further misfortune, that- the
weather proved hazy for three or four days while I was in the valley, and
not being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably. and at
last was obliged to find the sea-side, look for my post, and come back the
same way I went: and then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the
weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other
things, very heavy. ,

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and
I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog.
I had a. great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often been musing
whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a, breed of
tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and shot should be
all spent. I made a collar for this little creature, and with a string, which

I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me, I led him
109
along, though with some diflioulty, till I came to my bower, and there I
inclosed him and left- him, for I was very impatient to be at home, from
whence I had been absent. above a month.

1 cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old
hutch, and lie down in my hammock--bed. This little wandering journey,
without settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own
house, as I culled it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared to
that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved 1
would newn- go a great way from it again, while it should be my lot to stay
on the island.

1' reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long
journey 5 during which, most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair
of making a. cage for my Poll, who begun now to be u more domestic, and to
be well acquainted with me, Then I began to think of the poor kid which
T had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it
home, or give it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left
it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved for want of food.
I went and out boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as 1 did before, to lead it
away ; but it was so tame with being hungry, that. I had no need to have
tied it, for it followed me like a. dog; and as I continually fed it, the
creature become so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it become from that
time one of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept
the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the
anniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there two years,
and no more prespect of being delivered than the first day 1 come there I
spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with, and
without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble
and hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition than I should
have been in the liberty of society and in all the pleasures of the world;
that He could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and
the want of human society, by His presence and the communications of His
grace to my soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I begun sensibly to feel how much more happy this
no
life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, lillHJl the wicked,
cursed, abominuhlc. life I led all the past part of my days; and now i
changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my allian--
l-ious changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what
they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years post.

Before, as I walked uhout, either on my hunting, or for viewing the
country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me
on a. sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the woods,
the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner, looked up
with the eternal burs and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
without redemption. In the midst of the greatest composure of my mind,
this would break out upon me like a. storm, and make me wring my hands
and weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my
work, and 1 would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together; and this was still worse to me, for if I
could burst out. into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go ofi', and the
grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.

But now T began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read
the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, 1 opened the Bible upon these. words, " I will
never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Immediately it occurred that
these words were to me; why else should they be directed in such a
manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as
one forsaken of God and man? "Vi"ell, then," said I, "if God does not
forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though
the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?"

From this moment, I began to conclude in my inind, that it was
possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition, than
it was probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in
the world ; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for
bringing me to this place, I know not what it- was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words. "How canst
thou become such a hypocrite," said I, even audibly, " to pretend to be
thankful for a condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour to be
contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?"

So I stopped there, but though I could not say I thanked God for being
111 .
there, yel I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever
afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn
for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but
my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in England,
without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting
me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and
though I have not given the render the trouble of so particular an account
of my works this year as the first ; yet- in general it may he observed, that
I was very seldom idle, but; having regularly divided my time according to
the several daily employments that were before me, such as, first, my duty
to God, and the leading the Scriptures, which T constantly set apart some
time for, thrice every day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for
food, which generally took me up three hours in every morning, when it (lid
not. win ; thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking, what I had
killed or caught for my supply : these took up great part of the day. Also,
it. is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in
the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about
four hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in,
with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of limiting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun
in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added the
exceeding laboriousucss of my work; the many hours which for want of
tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did look up out of my
time. For example. I. was full two and forty days in making a. board for a
long shelf, which I wanted in my cziyc; whereas, two sawyers, with their
tools and a saw--pit, would have out six of them out of the same tree
in half a. day. '

My 011.80 was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be out down,
because my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days in
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a. log,
or piece of timber. W'ith inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced
both the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a. board from
end to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other side till I
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both

sides Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of
A 112current; :5 murmur-mu BY ms "mm;

work; but labour and patience carried me through that, and many other
things; I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much
of my time went away with so little work, viz. that; what might be a little
to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and required a prodigious
time to do alone, and by hand. But notwithstanding this. with patience
and labour I got through everything that my circumstances made necessary
to me to do, as will appear by what follows.

I was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my
crop of barley and rice, The ground I lmd mounted and dug up for them
was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the
quantity of half a peek, for I had lost one whole crop by planting in the dry
season. But now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found

I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts which it

"'1 aired speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my
rrup', I got 1:. totally \vell fenced in about three weeks' time; and shooting

for the fowls would not. only not (some at the com, but, in short, they forsooh
all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as

However, as my first crop was bul- smull, I had no great difficulty to cut it
down; in short, I rcuped it in my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears,
and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it
out with my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found that out
of my half--peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and about two
bushels and a half of barley ; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no
measure at that time. .

However, this was a. great encouragement to me, and T foresaw that, in
time, it would please God to supply me with bread. And yet here I was
perplexed again, for l neither know how to grind, or make meal of my corn,
or i ndeod, how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These
things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and to
secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to
preserve it all {Or seed against the next season; and, in the mean time, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of?
providing myself with corn and bread.

it might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I believe few
people have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things
necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and
finishing this one article of bread.

I, that. was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily
discouragement; and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after
I had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up
unexpectedly, and indeed to o. surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth--no spade or shovel to dig
it. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed
befom; but this did my work but in n wooden manner; and though it cost
me a great many days to make it, yet for want of iron, it. not only wore out

soon, but made my work the hauler, and made it be performed much worse.
us
However, this I bore wit-h, and was content to work it out with patience,
and bear with the holiness of the performance. When the corn was sown.
I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than
rake or borrow it. When it was growing, and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or renp it,
cure and wrry it home, thrash, part it from the chad", and save it. Then
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into
bread, and an oven to bake it; but all these things I did without, as shell
be observed; and yet the com was an inestimehle comfort and advantage to:
me too. All this, as I said, made everything laborious and tedious to me;
but that there was no help for. Neither was my time so much less to me,
because, as I had divided it, a certain pert of it was every day appointed to-
these works; and as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till
I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself
wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper for
the performing all the operations necessary for making the corn, when I had
it, fit. for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow
above an acre of ground Before I did this, I had a week's work at least to
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and
very heavy, and required double labour to work with it. However, I got
through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near
my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good.
hedge, the stakes of which were all out ofi' that wood which I had set before,
and knew it would grow; so that, in a year's time, I knew I should have a
quick or living hedge, that Would want but little repair. This work did
not take me up less than three months, because a great part of that time
was the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within-doors, that is
when it rained, and I could not go out, I found employment in the:
following occupations--always observing, that all the while I was at work,
I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak 3
and I quickly taught him to know his own name, and at last to speak it out
pretty loud, "Poll," which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the
island by any month but my own This, therefore, was not my work, but
an assistance to my work; for now, as I said, I had a. great employment
upon my hands, as follows : I had long studied to make, by some means or

other, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew not
no '
where to some at them. However, considering the heat. of the climate,
I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might make some pots
that might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough to
hear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and inquired to be kept
so; and as this was necessary in the preparing com, mun], &c. which was

the thing I was doing, I resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit
only to stand like jars, to hold What. should be. put into them.

it would make the render pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how
my awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what orlrl, misshapen, ugly
things I made; how many of them fall in, and how nmuy fell out the clay

not. being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
111
over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell
V in pieces with only lemoving, as well before as after they were dried 5 and,
in a word, how, aft-or having laboured hard to find the clay--to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, and work it--I could not. make uhove two large
earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in about two months' labour.

However. as the sun halted these two very dry and inn-d, I lifted them
very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker bushels,
which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not- hreak ; and us
bchvr-un the pot and the. baskot there was a. little room 1.0 spare, T stnfl'ed it
full of the rico and barley straw ; and those two pots being to stand always
dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the
corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made
several smaller things with better success; such as little round pots, (lat
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to; and the
heat. of the sun baked them quite hard.

But all this would not answer iny end, which was to get an earthen pot
to hold what was liquid, and hear the. firw--which none of these could do.
It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my
meat, when I wont to put it; out after I had done with it, I found a. broken
piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a. stone,
and red as a tile, I was agreeabl}r surprised to see it, and said to myself,
that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they Would burn
broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some
pots. I had no notion of a. kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing
them with load, though I had some lead to do it with; but I placed three
large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a pile, one upon another, and
placed my firewood all roxuid it with a. great heap of embers under them,
I plied Hm fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till
I saw the pots in the inside rod-hot quit-e through, and observed that they
(lid 1101. crack at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that
heat. about. five or six hours, till I found one of them, though it did not
crank, did melt or run -, for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted
by the. violence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I haul gone on;
so I slaclmd my fire gradually till the pots begun to abate of the red colour;
and, watching them all night, than; I might not let the fire abate too fast,
in the morning I had three very good (I will not. say handsome) pipkins,

118
and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt. as could be desired, and one of
them perfect-1y glazed with the running of the sand.

Alter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of earthen
were for my use 3 but I must needs say as to the shapes of them, they were
very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when T had no way of making
them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pics
that never learned to raise Paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I
found I had made an earthen pet that would hear the fire; and I had
hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the fire
again, with some water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably
well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I
wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it as good
as I would have had it been.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some
corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that perfec-
tion of art with one pair of hands To supply this want, I was at it grew;
loss; for, of all the trades in the world. I was as perfectly unqualified for a
stone-cutter, as for any whatever; neither had 1 any tools to go about it
with. I spent many 0. day to find out a great stone big enough to out
hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what
was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or out out; nor
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a
sandy crumbling stone, which neither would hear the weight of a heavy
pestle, nor would hl'efik the corn without filling it with sand. So, after a
great deal of lime lost in searching for a. stone, I gave it over, and resolved
to look out for a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed much
easier; and getting one as big as I had strength to stir, T. rounded it, and
formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help
of fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in
Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or heater,
of the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by against
1 had my next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or rather
pound, into meal, to make bread.

My next diflieulty was to make a sieve, or scarce, to dress my meal, and
to part it from the bran and the husk ; without which I did not see it
possible I could have any bread This was a most difficult thing, even to

think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it--
no
I mean fine thin canvas or stuff to source the meal through. And here I
was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do.
Linen I had none left but whnt was more rags; I had goats'-hair, but
neither knew how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how, here were
no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found for this was, that at
last T did remember I had. among the semnen's clothes which were saved
out of the ship, SOllle neckclolhs of celico or muslin; and with some pieces
of these T made three small sieves proper enough for the work ; and thus I
made shift for some years : how I did afterwards, I shall Show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should
make bread when I came to have corn ; for, first, I had no yeast. As to that
part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself much
about it But for on oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I found
out an experiment for that also, which was this :---I made some earthen
vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter,
and not above nine inches deep. These I burned in the fire, as I had done
the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake. I made a great
fire upon my heart-h, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own
baking and burning,r also; but I should not call them square.

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or live 'eoals,
I drew them forward upon this hearth, so 'as to cover it. all over, and there
I let them he till the hearth was very hot Then, sweeping away all the
embers, 1 set down my leaf or leaves, and whelming down the earthen pot
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and
add to the heat ; and thus, as well as in the best even in the world, I baked
my barley-loaves, and became, in little time, a good pastrycook into the
bargain; for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; but I
:made no pics, neither had I anything to put into them, supposing I had,
except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not he wondered at if all these things tool: me up most part of
the third year of my abode here; for, it is to be observed, that in the
intervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbanrh'y to manage;
for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I could.
and laid it up in the our, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out,
for I had no floor to thrash it. on, or instrument to thrash it with

And now, indeud,.my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build
my barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of the

bushels, and of the rice as much, or more; insonmoh that. now I resolved to
begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while;
also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole
year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the Forty bushels of barley and rice were
much more than 1' could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would fully provide me with bread1 8:42.

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts
run many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other
side of the island; and I was not, without: "secret wishes that: I were on
shore there, fancying that, seeing the main-hind, and an inhahited country,
1 might; find some way 01- other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at
Inst find some means of escape.

121 3
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an
undertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps
such as I might have reason to think for worse than the lions and tigers of
Africa : that if I once came in their power, I should run a hazard of more
than a. thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I
hurl heard thgn. the people of the Caribbean coast were oannibals, or man.
enters. and I knew by the latitude that I could not be far from that shore.
Then, supposing they were not eannibals, yet they might kill me, as many
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even when
they had been ten or twenty together~much more I, that was but one, and
could make little or no defence; all these things, I say, which I ought to
have considered well, and did come into my thoughts afterwards, yet gave
me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the thought
of getting over to the shore.

New I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder-
of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a. thousand miles on the coast of
Africa; but this was in vain : then I thought I would go and look at our
ship's boat, which, as I have said, wus blown up upon the shore a great way,
in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did
at first, but not quite ; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the
winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy, rough send,
but no water about her. If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to
have launched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough,
and I might have gone back into the Bruzils with her easily enough ; but I
might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon
her bottom, than I could remove the island ; however, I went to the woods,
and out levers and rollers, and brought them to the boot, resolving to try
what 1 could do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, I
might repair the damage she had received, and she would be u. very good
boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. '

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece. of fruitless toil, and spent, I think,
three or four weeks about it ; at last, finding it impossible to home it up
with my little strength, I fell to diging away the sand, to undermine it, and
so to make it fall down, set-ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right
in the fall '

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up gain, or to get
under it, much less to more it forward towurds the water ; so I was forced

to give it over ; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the bout, my
122
desire to venture over for the main increased. rather than decreased, as the
means for it seemed impossible.

This at; length put me upon thinking whet-her it was not possible to
make myself a canoe, or periuguu, such as the natives of those climates make,
even without tools, or, as 1 might say, without hands, of the trunk of a great
tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself
extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ; but not at all con-
sidering the particular inconveniences which [ lay under more than the
Indians did, viz. wnnlz of hands to move it, when it. was made, into the
water--o difliculty much harder for me to surmount than all the conse
quences of want of tools could he to them ; for whul- was it: to me, if when
I had chosen a. vast tree in the woods, and with much trouble cut it down,
if I had been able with my tools to hew and dub the outsirleinio the proper
shape of a. boot, and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to
make a bent. of it--if, after all this, I must leave it just there where T found
it, and nol: he uhle to launch it into the water?

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon
my mind of my circumstances while 1 was making this boat, but I should
lmve immediately thought- how I should get it into the see ; but my thoughts
were so intent upon my voyge over the sea in it, that 1 never once con~
sidercd how I should 'get it off the land : and it was really, in its own
rial-um, more easy for me to guide it over forty--five miles in sea, than abuuL
forty--five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did,
who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,
without determining whether I was ever able. to undertake it ; not but than
the diilieulty of launching my boat came often into my head ; but I put a
stop to my inquiries into it, by MI is foolish answer, which I gave myself:
" Let me first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other to get it
along when it is done."

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy
prevailed. and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, end I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a. one for the building of the Temple of
Jerusulem; it. was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower putt next the
stump, and {our feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty two feet;
after which it lessened for a while, mid then parted into branches. It was
not without infinite labour that l felled this tree ; I was twenty days

123
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the
branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head cut off, which I hacked
and hewed through with axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour: after
this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a. proportion, and to
something like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright us it
ought to do. -It cost me near three months more to clear the inside, and
work it out so as to make on exact boat of it; this I did, indeed, without
fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the (lint of hard labour, till I had
brought it to be u very handsome periogua, and big enough to have carried
six and twenty men, and consequently big enough to have curried mo and
all my cargo.

When .1 had gone through this Work, I was extremely delighted with it.
The host was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periogua, that
was made of one tree, in my life Many a Weary stroke it had cost, you
may be sure; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question but
I should have begun the inaddest-voyznze, and the most unlikely to be per-
formed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me ; though they cost
me infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water,
and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the
creek. Well, to take away this discmmxgcment, I resolved to dig into the
surface of the earth, and so make a declivit-y: this I began, and it cost
me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains that. have their
deliverance in vicw?); but when this was worked through, and this
difficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more stir
the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the distance of
ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the
canoe, seeing,r I could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I'
began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out,
I found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but my own, it
must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through with
it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been at
least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctaney, I gave
this attempt over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of
beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge lightly of

our own strength to go through with it.
124
In the middle of this work, 1' finisher! my fourth year in this place
and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much
comfort as ever before; for, by a constant study and serious application to
the Word of God. and by the assistance of His grace, I_gained a diii'ercnt
knowledge from What I had before. I entertained different notions 01
things. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had
not-hing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires about:
in a. word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to have;
so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a
place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as
Father Abraham to Dives. "Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed."

 

clwsm: 19 Exam; m :10": ms Born

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world
here ; I had neither the lusts of the flesh) the lusts of the *ye, or the pride
of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I w:".- now capable of
enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might call
myself king or emperor over the whole countr)r which I had possession of 2
there were no rivals 3 I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or
command with me: T. might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had
no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion.

I had tortoise or turtle enogh, but now and then one was as much as
125
I could put to any uSe: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships;
and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured into raisins,
to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.

But all I could maltr- use of was all that was valuable: I had enough
to eat and supply my \muts. and what was all the rest to me? If 1 killed
more flesh than I could eat, the (log must eat it, or vermin; if 1 sowed
more com than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down
were lying to rot, on the ground; I could make no more use of them but
for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon
just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no mum good
to us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up to
give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The most
covetous, griping raiser in the world would have been cured of the. vice of
covetousness, if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more
than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire, except it was
of things which I had not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of
great use to me. I had, as l hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
gold as silver, about. thirty-six pounds sterling, Alas! there the sorry,
useless stull' lay; I had no manner of business for it; and often thought
with myself, that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of
tobacco--pipes ; or for a. hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have
given it all for a sixpennyworth of turnip and carrot; seed out of England,
or for a. handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had
not the least advantage by it or benefit from it; but there it lay in a
drawer, and grew mould}r with the, damp of the cave in the wet seasons _:
and if I had had the dnxwer full of diamonds, it had been the same case,
they had been of no manner of value to me, because of no user

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than
it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I
frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of
God's providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I
learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon the
dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted ; and
this gave me sometimes such secret comforts. that. 1 cannot express them;
and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented people in
mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them,

because they see and covet something that he has not given them. All
126
our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring from the
want of thankfulncss for what we have,

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would he so
to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was,
to compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would
be; nay, with what- it would certainly have been, if the good providence
of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cost up nearer to the
shore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got
out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; Without which, I had
wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot
for getting my food.

1 spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself,
in the most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing out
of the ship. How I could not have so much as got any food, except fish
and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must
have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a
mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivunee,
I had no way to flay or Open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the
bowels, or to out it up ; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with
my claws, like a beast

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence
to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships
and misfortunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend to the
reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, "' Is any aflliction
like mine .2" Let them consider how much worse the cases of some people
are, and their case might have been, if Providence had thought fit.

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind
with hopes ; and this was compo-ring my present situation with What. I had
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence.
I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of
God. I had been well instructed by father and mother; neither had they
been wanting to me, in their early endeavours to infuse a religious awe.
of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the nature and end
of my being required of me. But, alas! falling early into the seafaring
life, which, of all lives, is the most destitute of the four of God, though His
terror-s are always before them; I say, falling early into the seafaring life,
anu into seafaring company, all that little sense of religion which I had

entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened
127
despising of dangers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me
by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse with
anything but what was like myself, or to hear anything that- was good
or tended towards it.

So void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of what
I was, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed~such as
my escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese master of the
ship ; my being planted so well in the Brazils ; my receiving the cargo from
England, and the like--I never had once the words, " Thank God," so much
as on my mind, or in my mouth ; not in the greatest distress had I so much
as a. thought- to pray to him, or so much as to say, " Lord, have mercy upon
me'." no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
blaspheme it. _

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have
already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and
when I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had
attended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt boun-
til'ully with inc--had not only punished me less than my iniquity had
deserved, but had so plentifully provided for rue-this gave me great hopes
that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy_in store
for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation to
the will of God in the present (deposition of my circumstances, but even to a
sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet aliving man,
ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have expected in
that place; that I ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice,
and to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of
wonders could have brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even
by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a.
long series of miracles: and that I could hardly have named a place in the
uninhabitable part of the world where I could have been cast more to my
advantage; :1 place where, as I had no society, which was my affliction on
one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to
threaten my life ; no venomous creatures, or poisons, which I might feed on
to my hurt; no savages to murder and devour me. In a word, as my life
was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted

nothing to make it a. life of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of
123L'Ruml's Infimnu ultra! ms 52x51; 0)! RI'LIGKOK ("W or um.

God's goodness to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily con-

away, and was no more sad I had now been here so long, that many things
which I had bronghhon shore for my help ware either quite gene, or very
much wasted and near spent. '

use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable

that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various providenccs
which befell me, and which, if 1 had been superstitiously inclined to observe

First, I had observed, that the same day that T broke away from my
father and friends, and ran away to lIull, in order to go to sea, the some day
afierwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and mode a slave; the
some day of the your that I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yur-
mouth Roads, that same day year afterwards I made my escape from Salleo
in n boat; the same day of the year I was born on, viz. the 30th of Septem-
ocr, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six years
after, when I was cast on shore in this island ; so that my wicked life and
my solitary life began both on a. day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, I mean
the biscuit which I brought out of the ship; this I had hushanded to the
last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a year;
and yet I was quite without bread for near a your before I got any corn of
my own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decafi as to linen, I had had none 3. good
while, except some chequered shirts which 1 found in the chests of the other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved; because many times I could bear
no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I
had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts
There were also, indeed, several thick watolncoats of the scomen's which
were left, but they were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the
weather was so violently hot that thew. was no need of clothes, yet I could
not go quite naked ~no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not;
----nor could I abide the thought of it, though I was alone. The reason why
I could not go naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked as with some clothes on ; nay, the very heat frequently blistered
my skin; whereas, with u. shift on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more
could I ever bring myself to go out. in the heat of the sun without a cap or
a. hat ; the heat of the sun, heating with such violence as it does in that
place, would give me the head-ache presently, by darting so directly on my
head, without a cap or hot on, so that I could not bear it ; whereas, if I" put
on my hat, it would presently go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,
which I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoals
I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make jackets out of

the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such other materials as
no '01'" R031 N805 CRUSOE.

I had; so I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed, botching, for I made
most pitoous work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three
new Waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a. great while; as for hreecbtzs
or drawers, T made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I
killed, I mean four--fooled ones, and I had thorn hung up, stretched out
with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard
that they were fit for little, but others were very useful. The first thing
I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside,
to shoot off the rain ; and this I performed so well,.that after, I made me. a.
suit of clothes wholly of these skins--that is to say, a waistcoat, and
brooches open at the knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to
keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that
they were wretehcdly made; for if I was a had carpenter, l was a. worse
tailor. However, they were such as I made very good shift with, and when
l was out, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being
outermost, I was kept very dry.

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella;
I was indeed in great; want of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had
seen them made in the lh-azils, where they are very useful in the great heats
there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being
nearer the equinox 3 besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a
most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world
of pains with it, and was a great while before 1 could make anything likely
to hold: nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three
before I made one to my mind: but at last I made one that answered
indifferently well ; the main difficulty I found was to make it; let. down
I could make it spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was
not portable for me any way but just over my head, which would not do.
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it- with skins,
the heir upwards, so that it cost on the ruin like a penthouse, and kept off
the sun so ell'eotually, that I hould walk out in the hottest of the weather
with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest, and when I had
no need of it, could close it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by
resigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
disposal of His providence This made my life better than sociable, for
when I began to regret the want of conversation, I would ask myself

181
whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I
may say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the
utmost enjoyment. of human society in the world?

I cannot. say that, after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing hap-
pened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture and
place, as before ; the chief things I was employed in, besides my yearly
labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which
I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one year's provision
beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily pursuit; of going
out with my gun, I had one labour, to make a canoe, which at last I finished :
so that, by digging a canal. to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought
it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly
big, for I made it without considering beforehand, as I ought to huve done,
how I should be able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it. was as a
memorandum to teach me to be iviser the next time: indeed, the next
time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I
could not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near
half a, mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over;
and though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour,
in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.

However, though my little periagua. was finisher], yet the size of it was
not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the
first ; I mean of venturing over to the tom-(L firma, where it was above forty
miles broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted lo put an end
to that design, and now I thought no more of it. As I had a. bout, my next
design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I had been on the
other side in one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the
land, so the discoveries I made in that little journey made me very eager to
see other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing
but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, that I might do everfihing with discretion and consi--
deration, I fitted up a. little most in my boat, and mode a sail too out of
some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and of which I had
a great stock by me Having titled my most and sail, and tried the boat, I
found she would sail very well: then I made little lockers, or boxes, at each
and of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, immunition, &c. into, to be

kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea; and a little, long, hollow
132
place I out in the inside of the bout, where I, could lay my gun, making a
flap to hang down over it, to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a most, to stand
over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and
thus 1 every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea: but never
went far out, nor far from the little creek. At last, being eager to view
the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise; and
accordingly 1 viotualled my ship for the voyage. putting in two dozen of
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley bread, on earthen pot- full
of parched rice (8. food I ate 9. great deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a.
goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of
those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamcn's chests;
these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my cap-
tivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much
longer than I expected ; for though the island itself was not very large, yet
when I came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out
about two leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it; and
beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a. leagxe more, so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point.

When first I discovered them, I was going to giveover my enterprise,
and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
sea: and, above all, doubting how 1 should get hawk again : so I came to
an anchor; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken
grappling which I got out. of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing
up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the full extent
of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong
and, indeed, a most furious current, which run to the east, and even came
close to the point; and I took the more notice of it, because I saw there
night be some danger, that when I came into it, I might. be carried out to
sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the island agahi: and,
indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe it would have been so ;
for there was the same current on the other side the island, only that it set
off at a. further distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the
shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first. current, and I

should presently be in an eddy. '
188
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at
ESE, and that being just contrary to the cru'rent, made a great breach of
the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to
the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the Wind having abated overnight, the
sea was calm, and I ventured : but I am a warning to all rash and ignorant
pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when l was not even my
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in It great depth of water,
and at current like the sluicc of a mill: it carried my boat along with it
with such violence that all I could do could not keep her so much as on
the edge. of it; butl found it hurried me [hither and ihrthcr out: from the
eddy, which was on. my left- hzmd. There was no wind stirring to help me,
and all I could do with my paddles signified nothing : and now I began to
give myself over for lost ; for as the current was on both sides of the island,
I knew in a few leagues' distance they must join again, and then T was
irrecoverably gone ; nor did I sec any possibility of avoiding it ; so that I
had no prospect before me but of pcrishing, not by the sea, for that was
calm enough, but. of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise
on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the bout;
zmd I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my calf-hen
pols ; but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to
he sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues
at least '1'

And now I saw how easy it. was for the providence of God to make
even the most. miserable condition of mankind Worse Now I looked back
upon my desolate, solitary islu-nd, as the most:- pleasant place in the world,
and all the happiness my heart, could wish for was to be but there again.
I stretched out. my hands to it, with eager wishes : "0 happy desert ! " said
I, "1 shall never see thee more. 0 miserable creature! whither am I
going i " Then I rcptouched myself with my unthankful temper, and that
I had rcpincd at my solitary condition; and now what would I give to be
onshore there again! Thus, we never see the true stall: of our condition
till it. is illustrated to us by its contrurics, nor know how to value. what we
enjoy, but by the want of it, It is scarcely possible to imagine the con--
sternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it
appeared to me now to he) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in
the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. However, 1 Worked hard

till indeed my strength was almost. exhausted, and kept my boat as much
134
to the northward, that is, towards the side of the current which the eddy
lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up
from 8.8.15. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in about
half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time, I had got at
a {rightful distance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather
intervened. I had been undone another way, too ; for I had no compass on
board, and should never have known how to have steered towards the
island, if I had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather continuing clear,
I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the current

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away,-
I saw even by the elearness of the water some alteration of the current
\vnfinear; for where the current was so strong the water was foul; but
perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I
found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks: these rocks I found caused the current to'part again, and as the
main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made
a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very sharp
stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the
ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such extremities, may guese what my present surprise 'of joy
was, and how gladly I put my bent into the stream of this eddy; and the
wind also fi'eshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheerfully
before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy undenioot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way. back again, directly
towards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the
current which carried me away at first; so that when I eume near the
island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out from.

. When I had made something more than a league of way by the help
of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther.
However, I found that being between two great currents, viz. that: on the
south side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay
about a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake

of the island, I found the water at least still, and running .no way; and
135
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the
island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being than within a, league of
the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster,
stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting oil' the
current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north;
and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my course
lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However, having a fresh
gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west; and in about an
hour came within about a. mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water,
I soon get to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my
deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my
boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat
close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees, and
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labom and fatigue of
the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat' I had
run so much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting
it by the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the
west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures. so I
resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the shore,
and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my irigate in safety,
so as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles, or these-
abouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile
over, which narrow ed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I
found a very convement harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if she
had been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and
see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been
before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of
my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began my
march. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had
been upon, and I reached my old bowe1 in the evening, where I found
every thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being,
as I said hefoie, my country house

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs.

for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my sleep
by a voice, calling me by my name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe : poor Robin Cmsoel Where are you, Robin Crusoe 2 Where are
you 2 Where have you been ? "

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or paddling as -
187 ' T
it is called, the first port of the day, and with walking the latter part, that
I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing bet-Ween sleeping and waking,
thought. I dreamed that somebody spoke to roe ; but. as the voice continued
to repeat, " Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," of. hist- I began to wake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up in the
utmos. consternation; but no sooner were my eyes Open, but I saw my
l'oll sitting on the top of the hedge ; and immediately knew that it was he
theispoke to me ; for just in such bemoaning langnge I had used to toll: to
him, and touch him ; and he had learned it so perfectly that- he would sit
upon my finger, and lay his bill olose to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been? How came you here?"
and such things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it
could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.
First, I was amazed how the creature got thither ; and then, how he should
just. keep aboui the place, and nowhere else ; but. as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and holding out my hand,
and calling him by his name, " Poll," the sociable creature came to me, and
set upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me, " Poor
Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here? and where had I been?" just
as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him home
along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enougn
to do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in.
I would have been very glad to have had my boot- again on my side of the
island; but. I knew not how it was practicable to get. it about. As to the
east side of the island, which I had gone round, I know well enough there
was no venturing that Way; my very heart would shrink, and my very
blood run chill, but to think of it ; and as to the other side of the island, I
did not know how it might be there; but supposing the current ran with
the same force against the shore at. the east as it. passed by it. on the other, I
might run the some risk of being driven down the stream, and carried by
the island, as I had been before of being curried away from it: so with
these thoughts, 1 contented myself to be without any boot, though it had
been the product of so many months" labour to make it, and of so many
more to gel, it into the sea.

In this government of my temper, I remained near a year; and lived a
very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose ; and my thoughts being

138mason In "mom was all! our NM

very much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning
myself to the disposiLions of Providence, 1 thought I lived really very
happily in all things, except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my
necessities put me upon applfing myself to; and I believe I should, upon
occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering how few
tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived al. an unexpected perfection in my caithenwere,
and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found
infinite!)r easier and better; because I made things round and shaped, which
before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was never mom
vnin of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than
for my being able to make a tobacco--pipe. ; and though it was a very ugly,
clumsy thing when it was done, and only binned red, like other earthenware,

yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly
139
comforted with it, for 1 had been always used to smoke; and there were
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not thinking that. there was
tobacco in the island ; and afterwards, when I searched the ship . min, I
could not come at any pipes.

' In my wickerware, also, I improved much, and made abundance of
necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very
handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying
things up in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, 1 could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces, and
bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle : I could cut. it up, take
out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and
bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large
deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I ulways rubbed out as
soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a
want which it was impossible for'me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to
say, how I should kill any goats. I had, as is observed, in the third year of
my being here, kept a. young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hopes
of getting a lie-goat : but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till my
kid grew an old goat- ; and as I could never find in my henrl. to kill her, she
died at last of mere age,

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said,
my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and
snare the goals, to see whether I could not catch some of them, alive; and
particularly, I wanted a she~goirt great- with young. For this purpose
1 made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more than
once taken in them ; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
I always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length, I
resolved to try a pitfall : so I dug several lurgc pits in the earth, in places
where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed
hurdles, of my own making too, with a great weight upon them 3 and
several times I put ears of barley and dry lice, without setting the trap;
and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn,
for I could see the marks of their feet. At length, I set three traps in one
night, and going the next morning, I found them all standing, and yet the
bait eaten and gone: this was very discouraging, However, I ultcrcd

my traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
' 140
see my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-goat; and in one of the
others, three kids, a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was so fierce, 1
durst not go into the pll. to him ; that is to say, to bring him away alive,
which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was not my
business, nor would it answer my end ; so I even let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I did not then
know what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a. lion. If I had let
him stay there three or four days without food, and then have carried him
some water to drink, and then a. little corn, he would have been as tame as
one of the kids; for they are mighty sagzwious, tractable creatures, where
they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time :
then I went to the three kids, and, taking them one by one, I Lied them with
strings together, and with some dilhculty brought them all home.

It was a. good while before they would feed; but throwing them some
sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I found
that if I expected to supply myself with goats' flesh, when 1 had no powder
or shot left, breeding some up fume was my only way, when, perhaps, 1
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But, then, it
occurred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only way for this was to have
some inelosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those
without- break in.

This was a. great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet, as I saw there
was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a
proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them to
ea. , water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very little con-
trivance, when I pitched upon a plane very proper for all these (being a
plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people call it in the
western colonies), which had two or three little drills of fresh water in it,
and at one end was very Woody,--I say, they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them I bgan by inclosing this piece of ground in such a
manner, that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about.
Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles

about, I was like to have time enough to do it in; but I did not consider
141
that my goats would be as wild in so much compass as if thcy had had the
whole island, and 1 should have so much room to chase them in that I
should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when
this thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the
beginning, I resolved to inclose a piece of about one hundmd and fifty
yards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would
maintain as many us I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock
increased, I could add more ground to my inolosure.

This was acting with some pruclenee, and I went to work with courage.
I was about. thiee months hedging in the first piece; and, till 1 had done it,
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to feed as
near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I would go and
carry them some ears of barley, or a handful ol' rice, and feed them out of
my hand; so that, after my inolosm'o was finished, and I let thorn loose,
they would follow me up and down, bloating after me for a handful of corn.

This answered my end, and in about a year and u hall" 1 had a [lock of
about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had three--and-
forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. After that, I
inclosed five several pieces of ground in feed them in. with little pens to
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, und gates out of one piece of
ground into another.

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goats' [hash to feed on
when I pleased, but milk too,--o thing,r which, indeed, in the beginning, I
did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a. day. And as Nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates oven naturally how to make use
of it, so I, that had never milked meow, much less a goat, or seen butter
or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays and
miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at. last, also salt (though I
found it partly made to my hand by the heat. of the sun upon some of
the rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can
our Creator treat His creatures, oven in those. conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can He sweeten the
bitterost prnvidencos, and giro us cause to praise Him for dungeons and
prisons! "That a. table was here spread for mo in the wilderness, where

It would have made o Stoic smile to have seen me and my little fl'nnily
sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord of the
whole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command ;
I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take ii. away, and no rebels among all
my subjects. Then, to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended
by my servants ! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the only penaon
permitted to talk to me My dog, who was now grown old and crazy,
and had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right
hand; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and one on the other,
expecting now and then a. bit from my hand, as a mark of especial favour. .

But these were not the two eats which I brought on shore at. first, for
they were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by
my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what
kind of creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas the
rest mu wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last,
for they would often come into my house, and plunder me, too, till at last I
was obliged to shoot them, and did kill 0. great many; at length they left

me. With this attendance and in this plentiful manner I lived: neither
143nomxso)': cnoson

could I he said to want anything but society , and of that,s some time alter
this I was likely to have much

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my
boat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes
I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at, other times I sat.
myself down contented enough without her. But I had 9. strange uneasiness
in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as l have said in
my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do: this inclination increased
upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land,
following the edge of the shore. I did so; but had any one in England
met such a. man as I was, it must either have frightened him, or raised a.
great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I
could not but smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such on cqnipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my
figure, as follows :--

I had a. great high shupclcss cop, made of a goat's skin, with a. flap
hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot. the min
off from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these climates
as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to about the
middle of the thighs, and a pair of open~kneed breaches of the same ; the
breaches were made of the skin of an old lie-goat, whose hair hung down
such a length on either side, that, like puntuleons, it reached to the middle
of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of
somethings, T scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my
legs, and lace on either side like spatter-dashes, but of a most barbarous
shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on u broad belt- of goat's skin dried, which I drew together with
two thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a. kind of a frog on
either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a. little saw and a
hatchet, one on one side, and one on the other. I had another belt not so
broad, and fastened in the some manner, which hung over my shoulder, and
at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's
skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot At my
buck I carried my basket, and on my shoulder, my gun, and over my head
a great clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most

necessary thing I had about me next to my gun. As for my face, the colour
144GRIND! lqm mm m3 315 JOERIN'EY.

of'it was really not so mulatto--like as one might expect from a man not at
all careful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My
board I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yanl long;
but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, _I had cut it pretty short,

except what grew on my upper lip, which Iliad trimmed into a large pair
145 U
of Muhomemn whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some {Flu-ks at Sallcc,
for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks (lid; of these moustachios,
or whiskers, l. will not say they were long enough to hung my hat upon
them, but they were of a length and shape monhtrous enough, and such as
in England would have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few to observe
me, that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of that. In
this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out five or six day's. I
travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to an anchor to gel: upon the rocks; and having no heat now to
take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the same height. that I
was upon before, when, looking forward to the points of the rocks which lay
out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I
was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet--no rippling. no motion,
no current, any more there than in any other places. I was at a strange loss
to understand this, and resolved to spend some time in the observing it,
to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was
presently convinced how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from some great river on the
shore, must be the Occasion of this current, and that, according as the wind
blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, this current came nearer,
or went farther from the shore ; for, waiting therenbouta till evening, I went
up to the rock gain, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw
the current again as before, only that it ran farther off, being near half a
league from the shore, whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and
hurried mo and my canoe along with it, which at another time it would not
have done, '

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe
the ebbing and the flowing of the title, and I might very easily bring my
boot about the island again; but when I began to think of putting it in
practice, I hurl such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the '
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any patience,
but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe,
though more laborious--and this was. that I would build, or rather make,
me another poring-on or canoe, and so have one for one side of the island, and
one for the other.

You are to understand, that. now I had, as I may call it, two plantations

in the island,----one my little fortification or tent, with the well about it,
146
under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged
into several apartments, or caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification,
----tha.t is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up
with the large earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great. baskets, which would hold live or six bushels each,
where I laid up my stores of provisions, especially my corn, some in the car,
out off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles
, grew all like trees, and were by (his time grown so big, and spread so very
much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one's view, of any
habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther Within the land, and upon
lower ground, lay my two pieces of com land, which I kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and
whenever I had occasion for more com, I had more land adjoining as fit
as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had new a tolerable planta-
tion there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept
in repair--that is to say, I kept the hedge, which encircled it in, constantly
fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the inside. '
kept the trees, which at first were no more than stakes, but were now grew
very firm and tall, always out, so that they might spread and grow thielx
and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did effectually to
my mind. In the middle of this 1 had my tent always standing, being a
piece of a. sail spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I had made me a. sqnab
or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket hide): them, such as belonged to our sea--bedding,
which I had saved ; and a great watch-coat to cover me. And here, when-
ever I had occasion to be absent from my chief scat, T took up my country
habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my
goats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to [lance and inclose
this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should
break through, that I never left off till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the
outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another. that

it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand
14':
through between them ; which afterwards. when those stakes grew, as they
all did in the next rainy season, made the inclosure strong like a wall,
indeed stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains
to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support,
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand
would be a KW magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long
as I lived in the place, if it were to he forty years; and that keeping them
in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my inolosnres to such
a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which, by this
method, indeed, I so effectual] y secured, that when these little stakes begun
to grow, I had planted them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of
them up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depend-
ed on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve
very carefully, as the best and most. agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and
indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing,
and refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way betweenmy other habitation and the
place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my
way thither, for 1 used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all things
about, or belonging to her, in very good order. Sometimes I went out in

V her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, seamely
ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of
Doing hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any
other accident But now I come to a new scene of my life.

It happened one clay, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceed-
ingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which
was very plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck,
or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked round me, but I
could hear nothing, nor see anything ; 1 went up to a rising ground, to look
farther 3 1 went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all one: I
could see no other impression but that one. I went to it again to see if
there were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but there
was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot--toes, heel,
and every part of a foot. How it came thither I know not, nor could I in
the least imagine; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a. man

perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification, not
148
feeling as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and
tree, and fancying every stump at a. distance to be a. man. Nor is it possible
to describe how many various shapes my aflrightcd imagination represented
things to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my
fancy, and what strange, unacmuntable whimseys come into my thoughts
by the way.

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever alter this), I
fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as first

contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a door, I
cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning, for never
frightened hare (led to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind then
I to this retreat. '

I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my
fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrairy
to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all
creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of
the thing, that I formed nothixg but dismal imaginations to myself, even
though I was new a. great way ofi'. Sometimes I fancied it must he the

devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition, for how should any.
149urn AND anvsxrimas

other thing in human shape come into the place? Where was the vessel
that brought them? What marks were there of any other footstep? And
how was it possible a man should come there? But then, to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place, where there
could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot
behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure I
should see it,--this was an amusement the other way. I considered that
the devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified
me than this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the other
side of the island, he would never have been so simple as to leave a mark
in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether l should ever see it
or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high
wind, would have defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the
thing itself, and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtilty
of the devil. >>

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all
apprehensions of its being the devil ; and I presently concluded then, that
it must be some more dangerous creature, viz. that it must be some of the
savages of the main land opposite, who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea; being
as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I would have
been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful
in my thoughts, that I was so happy as not to he thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded that
some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther
for me Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having
found out my boat, and that there were people here; and that, if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater numbers, and devour me;
that if it should happen that they should not find me, yet they would find
my inelosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame
godts, and I should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence
in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had
of His goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not
preserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His

goodness. I xepmached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any
150
more com one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if no
accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon
the ground; and this I thought so just u reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years' corn beforehand; so that, whatever might
come, I might not perish for want of bread.

How strange a chequer--work of Providence is the life of man! and by
what secret different springs are the affections hurried about, as difi'erent
circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate; to-day
we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we
fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in
me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable, for 1, whose only
allliction was that I seemed banished from human society, that I was alone,
circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut oil" from mankind, and con-
demned to what I call silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought
not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among the rest
of His cleatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have
seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation could bestow. I
say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appear-
ancc of a man having set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life 5 and it afforded me a. great
many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my
inst surprise I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely
wise and good providence of God had determined for me; that us I could
not foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I
was not to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an
undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as He
thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had ofi'ended Him, had
likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought fit;
and that it was my part to submit to beer His indignation, because I had
sinned against Him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not only
righteous, but cmnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and ufliict me,
so He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think fit- to do so, it
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to.
His will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him,
pray to Him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and directions of His

daily providence.
151
These thoughts took me up many horns, days, nay, I may say weeks
and months: and one particular eli'ect of my <<:i'igitations on this occasion
I cannot omit One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it
discomposed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture
came into my thoughts: " Cell upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of
my bed, my heart was not. only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged
to pray earnestly to God for deliverance : when l had done praying, I took
up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that presented to me
were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen
thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to express the
comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the hook, and
was no more sad, at least on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it
come into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a more chimera of
my own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when T came
on shore from my beat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to
persuade myself it was all a. delusion; that it was nothing else but my own
foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I was
going that way to the boat? Again I considered also, that. 1 could by no
means tell, for certain, Where I had trod, and where I had not ; and that if,
at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played the part of
those fools who try to make stories of spectres and ,uppuritions, and then
are frightened at them more than anybody.

New I began to take eouinge, and h) peep abroad again, for I had not
stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that l began to starve
for provisions; forl had little or nothing within doors but some barley-
cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too,
which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it- almest spoiled
some of them, and almost dried up their milk. Encouraging myself,
therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, and that I might be truly said to start at my own shadow, I
began to go abroad again, and Went to my country house to milk my (look:
but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me,
how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run for

my life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted with an
162
evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly frightened ; and so,
indeed, I had. However, I went down thus two or three days, and having
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really
nothing in it. but my own imagination; but I could not persuade myself
fully of this till I should go down to the shore again, and see this print of
a foot, and measure it. by my own, dud see if there was (my simililrude or
fitness, that I might. be assured it was my own foot: but when I came to
the place-<<first, it. appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my bout,
1 could not possibly be on shore, anywhere thereahouts: secondly, when
1 came to measure the mark with my own foot, 1 found my foot not. so
large by a great deal. Both these things filled my head with new imagina-
tions, and gave me the impetus again to the highest degree, so that I shook
will: cold like one in an aguo; and I went home again, filled with the
belief that- some men or men had been on shore there; or, in short, that
the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware;
and whut course to take for my security I knew not

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! It
deprives them of the use of those means which reason ofi'ers for their relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my inelosurcs, and
turn all my term; cattle wild into the woods, lest the enemy should find
them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the some or the like
booty: then the simple thing of digging up my two corn-fields, lest they
should find such a. grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the island:
then to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges
of habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the
persons inhabiting.

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after I was come
home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours. Thus, fear of danger is
ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the evil
which we are anxious about: and what was worse than all this, I had not
that relief in this trouble that, from the resignation I used to practise, I
hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not only
that the Philistinos were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for 1
did not now take duc ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my
distress, and resting upon His providence, as 1 had done before. for my

defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been more
158 x
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried thrdugh
it with more resolution

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the
morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been, as
it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked
much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began to
think sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this island
(which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitfid, and no farther from the main
land than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might. imgmc ;
that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet
that there might sometimes come boats oil' from the shore, who, either with
design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might
come to this plane; that I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; and that, if at any
time they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as
soon as ever they could, seeing they. had never thought fit to fix here upon
any occasion ; that the most 1 could suggest any danger from was, from any
casual accidental landing of struggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here gainst their wills, so they
made no stay here, but went off again with all possible speed; seldom
staying one night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides
and dayfiht back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to
consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to
bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where
my fortification joined to the rock : upon maturely considering this, there
fore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the manner of a
semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention: these
trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but few piles to be
driven between them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and my
wall would be soon finished. 80 that I had now a double wall; and my
outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything
I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as
big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of this, I thickened my
wall to about ten feet thick, with continually bringing earth out of my

cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and
154
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took
notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like
my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that hold them like a carriage, so
that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time ; this wall I was
many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till
it was (lone.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a
great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,
which 1 found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I
believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large
space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy,
and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to
approach my outer wall.

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five or six years"
time I had a wood before my dwc ' g, growing so monstrously thick and
strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable : and no men, of what kind
soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a
habitation As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out
{for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the
rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another
ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken clown, no man living
could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own
preservation ; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not altogether
without just reason ; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my
more fear suggested to me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs;
for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were
not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient
for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also without the
fatigue of hunting after the wild ones ; and I was loath to lose the advan--
tage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over main.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways
to presewe them : one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave
under ground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was to
enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as

much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen young
166
goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general,
1 might be able to raise them again with little trouble and Lime : and this,
though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the
most rational design. .

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the
island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart
could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once
before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the
island. Here I found a, clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded
with woods, that it was almost on inclosure by nature; at least, it did not
want near so much labour to make it so, as the other piece of ground I had
worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and, in less
than a month's time, I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it
which you please, which were not-so wild now as at first they might be
supposed to he, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further
delay, I removed ten young she-goats, and two lie-goats, to this piece ; and,
when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it as
secure as the other; which, however, 1 did at more leisure, and it took me
up more time by a great deal. All this labour I was at the expense of,
purely fiom my apprehensions on account of the print of a. man's foot ,
for, as yet, I had never seen any human creature come near the island; and
I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my
life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be Well imagined
by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear
of man. And this 1 must observe, with grief, too, that the discomposure
of my mind had grout impression also upon the religious part of my
thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and
cunnihals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due
temper for application to my Maker ; at least. not with the sedate calmness
and resignation of soul which I was wont to do : I rather prayed to God as
under great aflliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in
expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning;
and I must testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thank-
l'ulness, love, and ulTection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than
that of terror and discomposure; and that under the dread of mischief

impending, a men is no more fit for o comforting performance of the duty
156
of praying to God, than he is for a repentance on a sick bed; for these dis-
composures afi'eet the mind, as the others do the body; and the discom--
posure of the mind must. necessarily be as great a disability as that of the
body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an act of the
mind, not of the body. '

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little living
stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place to
make such another deposit ; when, wandering more to the west point of the
island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a
boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or
two in one of the seamon's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had
it not about me; and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any
longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do not know, but as I descended
from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to
go no more out without a perspective glass in my pocket. When I was
come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never
been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's
foot was not such astrange thing in the island as I imagined; and but that
it was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing
was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened
to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for
harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes. the victors,
having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where,
according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill
and eat them; of which hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the
SW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore
spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and
particularly, I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a
circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their inhuman fenstings upon the bodies of their
fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no
notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my appro-

hensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish
157
brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though
I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before ; in short,
I turned awoy my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grow sick,
and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder
from my stomach ; and having vomited with uncommon violence. I was a
little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment ; so I got
up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards my
own habitation. '

When I came u. little out of that part of the island, I stood still awhile,
as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost
affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks,
that had cast my first let in a port of the World where l was distinguished
from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though 1 had esteemed my
present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it
that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of -. and this,
above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a.
felicity more than suificiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
sufl'ered, or could suffer.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began to
be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever 1 was
before: for I observed that these matches never came to this island in
search of what they could get ; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting, anything here ; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered,
Woody part of it, without finding anything to their purpose. I knew I had
been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years mere as
entirely concealed us I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which
I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to keep
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort of
creatures than oannibals to make myself known to. Yet I entertained such
an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of
the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another
up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle,
for almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I mean by it my
three plantations, viz. my castle, my country-seat (which I called my
bower), and my inclosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any

other use than as an inclosure for my goats; for the aversion which nature
153
gave me to these hellish wretchea was such, that I was as fearful of seeing
them as of seeing the devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after
my boat all this time, but began rather to think of making another; for I
could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other heat
round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at
sea; in which case if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I
knew what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that l was in no danger of
being discovered by these people, began to wear of? my uneasiness about
them; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before,
0nl y with this difl'erenco, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more
about me than 1 did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them ; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of
them, being on the island, should happen to hear it. It was, therefore, a
very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed
of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the woods, or
shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps
and snares, as I had done before ; so that for two years after this, I believe
I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without it; and
what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin
belt I also furbished up one of the great outlasses that-I had out of the
ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that 1' was now a most
formidable follow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former
description of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great broad-
sword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting
these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way of living. All
these things tended to show me, more and more, how far my condition
was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other
particulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have made my lot.
It put me upon reflecting how little repinjng there would be among
mankind at any condition of life, if people would rather compare their
condition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be
always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their mur-
murings and complainings

As in my present condition there were not really many things which

I wanted, so, indeed. I thought that the frights I had been in about these
159
savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation.
had token 011' the edge of my invention for my own conveniences; and I
had dropped a good design, which I had once bout my thoughts upon,
and that was to try if I could not make some of my barley inw malt, and
then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical thought,
and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it: ,for I presently saw
there would he the want of several things necessary to the making my beer,
that it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve
it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never
compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay months,
in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to
make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it
boil; and yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not the
flights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had undertaken
it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over
without accomplishing it, when once I had it in my head to begin it.
But my invention now run quite another way; for, night and day, 1 could
think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters in their
cruel, bloody entertainment; and, if possible, save the victim they should
bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set down all the contrirauees I hatched, or
rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures,
or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more:
but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, unless
I was to be there to do it myself: and What could one man do among
them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together
with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot
as true to a mark as I could with my gun?

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they
made their fire, and putting in five .or six pounds of gunpowder, which,
when they kindled their fire, would consequently'take fire, and blow up all
that was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to waste
so much powder upon thorn, my store being now within the quantity of one
barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when
it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make
them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; and then proposed that I would
place myself in ambush in some convenient place, with my three guns all

usemason rm ts: nmnumon or m cm

double loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at>> them.
when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot;
and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made
no doubt but. that>>, if there were twenty, I should kill them all. This fancy
pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often
dreamed of it, and sometimes, that I was just; going to let fly at. them in
my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself
several days to find out proper places to put. myself in amhuscadejas I

said, to watch for them, and I went frequently to the place itself, which
161 y
was now grown more familiar to me; but while my mind was thus filled
with thoughts of revenge and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to
the sword, as T may call it, the honor I had at the place, and at the signals
of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice. Well.
at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where l was satisfied I might
securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into
some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough to
conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close
together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot,
or that. I could fail wounding three or four'of them at the first shot. In
this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and accordingly, I prepared
two muskets and my ordinary fouling-piece. The two musicals I loaded
with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size
of pistol bullets; and the feuding-piece I loaded with near a. handful of
swan-shot- of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four
bullets each; and, in this posture, well provided with armnunition for a
second and third change, I prepared myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of .my design, and 'in my imagination
put itin practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of
the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles, or
more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the
island, or standing over towards it; bntl begun to tire of this hard duty,
after I had for two or three months constant-1y kept my watch, but came
always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that time,
been the least appearance. not only on or "our the shore, but on the whole
ocean, so for as my eyes or glass could reach every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I
kept up the vigour of my design and my spirits seemed to be all the while
in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or
thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all entered into any
discussion of _ in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first
iired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of
that country; who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in His wise
disposition of the world, to have no other guide than that of their own
abominable and vitiatcd passions; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps

had been so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such
102
dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven,
and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them into.
But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursion which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain,
so my opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I began, with cooler"
and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in; what
authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these
men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to
suffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of His
judgments one upon another; how far these people were offenders against
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they
shed promiscuously upon one another. I debated this very often with
myself thus: " How do I know what God himself judges in this particular
case? It is certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not
against their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them;
they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of
divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit They think it
no more a crime to- kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ex;
or to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton."

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was
certainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the
sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than
those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken
in battle ; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of
men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their
arms, and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that although
the usage they gave one another was thus brntish and inhuman, yet it was
really nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that if they
attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall
upon them, something might be said for it: but that I was yet out of their
power, and they really had no knowledge of mo, and consequently no
design upon me; and, therefore it could not be just for the to fall upon
them; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their
barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these
people; who, however they were idoluteis and barbarians, and had several
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people;

and that the rooting them' out- of the country is spoken of with the utmost
168
abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves, at this time,
and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butehcry, a bloody
and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and for
which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible
to all people of humanity or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men. who Were
without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the
miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full
stop ; and I began, by little and little, to be oil" my design, and to conclude
I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the savages; and
that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they first attacked
me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent: but that, if I were
discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I
argued with myself, that this really was the way not to deliver myself, but
entirely to ruin and destroy myself; - for, unless I was sure to kill every
one that not only should be on shore at that time, but that should ever
come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country--
people what had happened, they would come over again by thousands to
revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a
certain destruction, which, at present, I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought, neither in principle nor in
policy, one way or other, to concern myself in this ail'air: that my business
was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, and not to leave
the least sign for them to guess by that there were any living creatures
upon the island--I mean of human shape. Religion joined in with this
prudential resolution; and, I was convinced now. many ways, that I was
perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the
destruction of innocent creatures--I mean innocent as to me. As to the
crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had not-hing to do with
them; they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of God,
who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by national punishments,
to make a just retribution for national offences, and to bring public judg-
ments upon those who ofi'end in a public manner, by such ways as best
please Him. This appeared so clear to me now, that. nothing was a. greater
satisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing which I
now saw so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than

that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most humble
16-5
thanks, on my knees, to God, that He had thus delivered me from blood-
guiltiness; heseeching Him to grant me the protection of His providence,
that I might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might not
lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear cell from Heaven to do
it, in defence of my own life

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far
was I from desiring an occasion for talling upon those wretches, that in all
that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there were any of
them in sighyor to know whether any of them had been on shore there or
not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against
them, or be provoked by any advantage that might present itself, to fall
upon them: only this I did; I went and removed my boat, which I had
on the other side of the island, and carried it down to the east- end of the
whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some
high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages duxst
not, at least would not, come with their boats upon any account whatever.
With my host I carried away everything that I had left there belonging to
her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail
which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but which indeed
could not be called either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the bcstl
could make of its kind: all these I removed, that there might not be the
least shadow for discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human
habitat-ion upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more
retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell except. upon my constant
employment, to milk my she-goats, and manage my little (lock in the wood,
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was out of danger;
for certain it is that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this
island, never came with any thoughts of finding anything here, and con-
sequently never wandered oll' from the coast, and I doubt not but they
might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them
had made inc cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked back with
some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been,-
if I had chopped upon them and been discovered before that; when, naked,
and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small
shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island to see
what I could get; what a surprise should I have been in, if, when I
discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or

twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and, by the swiftnws of their
185
running, no possibility of my escaping them! The thoughts of this some-
times sunk my very sou'. within me, and distressed my mind so much that
I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and how I
should not only have been unable to resist them, but even should not have
had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much less
what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might be able
to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be very
melancholy, and, sometimes, it would last a great while; but I resolved it
all, at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me
from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which
I could have no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I
had not the least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposi-
tion of its being possible. This renewed a contemplation which often had
come into my thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the
merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this
life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it; how,
when we are in a quandary (as we call it), a doubt or hesitation whether to
go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we
intended to go that way: nay, when sense, our own inclination, and
perhaps business, has called us to go the other way, yet a strange impres-
sion upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not
what power, shall overrule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that way which we should have gone, and even to
our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been mined and lost.
Upon these, and many like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule-
with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of mind, to-
doing or not doing anything that presented, or going this way or that way,
I never failed to obey the'secret dictate; though I knew no other reason
for it than such a pressure or such a hint, hung upon my mind. I could'
give many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life,
but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island;
besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice
of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I see with now. But it is
never too late to be wise ; and I cannot but advise all considering men,
whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of
Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence they will. That

I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they are
168
a. proof of the converse of spirits, and a secret communication between
those embodied and those uneinhodicd, and such a. proof as can never be
withstood ; of which I shall have occasion to give some very remarkable
instances in the remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if I conibss that
these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was
now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivanccs that
I had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences. I had the care
of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not
to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might
make should be heard : much less would I the a gun for the some reason:
and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke,
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this
reason, I removed that part of my business which required fire, such as
burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my new apartment in the woods; where,
after I had been some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation a mere
natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say,
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture
in ; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
so much as a safe retreat

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by
mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick branches
of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on I must observe the reason of
my making this charcoal, which was thus : I was afraid of making a smoke
about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. ; so I contrived to burn
some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became

' ohark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to
carry home, and perform the other services for which fire was wanting,
without danger of smoke. But this is by the bye. While I was cutting
down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low
bmshwood or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place: I was curious
to look in it; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it
was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and
perhaps another with me: but I must confess to you that I made more
haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the place, and which was

perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether
167
devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the dim light
from the cuve's mouth shining directly in, and marking the reflection
However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself a
thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and that I might well
think there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself
Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed
again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in,
before I was almost as much frightened as before ; for I heard a very loud
sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken
noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped
back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a. cold
sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my
hair might not have lifted it oll'. But still plucking up my spirits as well
as I could, and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power
and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped
forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over
my head, I saw lying on the ground a. monstrous, frightful, old he--goat, just
making his will, as we say, and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of more
old age, I stirred him a little to see if I could get. him out, and he <<assayed
to get up, but was not. able to raise himself ; and I thought with myself he
might even lie them--for if he had frightened me, so he would certainly
fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in
there while he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me,
when I found the cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be about
twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no
hands having ever been employed in making it but thOSe of more Nature
I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in
further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not ; so, having no candle,
I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go again the next day provided
with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I conic provided with six large candles of
my own making (for I made very good candles now of goat's tallow, but
was hard set for Candlewick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and some-

times the dried rind of a weed-like nettles) ; and going into this low place
168cum: mm A DYING Emu m rm: (le.

I was obliged to creep upon all-"fours, as I have said, almost ten yards---
which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew not how for it might go, not what was beyond it. When I had got
through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as
it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave--the wall
reflected u hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. What it
was in the rock--whether diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold--
.which I rather supposed it to bo--I knew not. The place I was in was a.
most delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry
and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there was
no nauseous or venomous omture to be seen, neither was there any damp
or wet on the sides or root". The only difliculty in it was the entrance----
which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted, I thought was a. convenience; so that I' was really rejoiced at the
discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things
which I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved to
bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two
fowlingpieces--lbr I had three in all~--mul three muskets-nfor of them I
mu 2
had eight in all; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready
mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also
to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my
ammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out
of the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water had pene--
trated about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which

coking and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a. kernel in the
shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of
the cask. This was a. very greeable discovery to me at that time; so I
carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of
powder with me in my castle, for fear of a. surprise of any kind; I also

carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to
live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them ; for I
persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to
hunt me, they could never find me out--or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found expiring died in
the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I
found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover
him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to prevent
offence to my nose

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and
was so naturalized to the place and the manner of living, that, could I but
have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to dis-
turb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending the
rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and
(lied, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diver-
sions and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal more p1ea~
santly with me than it did before ;--first, I had taught my Poll, as I named
before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and
plain, that it was very pleasant to me ; and he lived with me no less than
six-and-twenty years. How long he might have lived afbemvards I know
not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that lahey live a
hundred years My dog was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no
less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age As for
my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that i' was
obliged to shoot seveml of them at first, to keep them from devouring me
and all 1 had; but, at length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually drivm them from me, and
letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods,
except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when
they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my family,
Besides these I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom
I taught to food out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all call _" Robin Crusoe," but none like my
first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that i had done
with him. I had also several tame searfowls, whose name I knew not, that .
I caught upon the shore, and out their wings ; and the little stakes which I
had planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to a good thick

grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which
171mummy. aumu um m.

was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to he very well
contented with the life I led, if I could have been secured from the dread
of the savages. But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss
for all people who shall meet. with my story to make this just observationMir-BMW" mean.

from it :---How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in
itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most
dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into.
I could give many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life 1
but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circum-
stances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.

It was now the month of .l)ecember, as I said above, in my twenty-
third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call
it), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty
much abroad in the fields, when. going out early in the morning, even

before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some
173
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, toward that
part of the island where I had observed some savages had been, as before,
and not on the other side--but, to my great affliction, it was on my side of
the island. .

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within
my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no
more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in
rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my
works or improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were
people in the place, and would then never rest till they had found me out
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder

after me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.
I loaded all my cannon, as I called them--that is to say, my muskets,
which were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and
resolved to defend myself to the lust gasp,--not forgetting seriously to
commend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this posture
about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I
had no spies to send out. After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I

should do in this ease, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer;
174
so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat place,
as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder after me, I set it up again
and mounted the top of the hill, and pulling out my perspective glass,
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the
ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found there were no
less than nine naked savages, sitting round a smell fire they had made, not
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely
hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human
flesh which they harl brought with them, whether alive or dead 1 could
not tell.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the
shore; and as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait for the
return of the deed to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what
confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side of

' the island, and so near to me; but when I considered their coming must. be
always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate
in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time
of the flood of tide, if they were not on shore before; and having made
this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with the more
composure.

As 1 expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made to the west>>
ward, I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle us we call it) away. I
should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went ofi' they
were dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my
glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest observation. but that they Were
stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether they .
were men or women I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my
shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side
Without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away
to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as soon
as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could not go
quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), 1 perceived there had been
three canoes more of the savages at that place; and looking out further, I
saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main. This was a
dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the shore, I could see the
marks of horror which the dismal work they had been about had left
behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies

175
eaten and devoured by those "remixes with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the sight, that -I now began to premeditate the
destruction of the next. that I saw there, let them be Whom or how many
soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits which they made thus to
this island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before
any more of them came on shore there again,--that is to say, l neither saw
them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to the
rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far.
Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the. constant appre-
hensions of their coming upon me by surprise: from whence I observe,
that the expectation of evil is more hitter than the suffering, especially if
:hcre is no room to shake ofl' that expectation, or those apprehensions

During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and spent most of
my hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how
to circumvent and fell upon them the very next time I should see them;--
especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time, into two
parties ; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one party--suppose ten or
a. dozen--l was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and
so another, even ad infinitmw, till 1 should be, at length, no less a murderer
than they were in being mau-eaters--und perhaps much more so. I spent
my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I
should one day or other fall into the hands of these merciless creatures; and
if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not without looking around me
with the greatest care and cuution imaginable. And now I found, to my
great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd
of goats, for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that
side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the
savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days,
and then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and three
months more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found
them again. as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have been there
once or twice; but either they made no stay, or at least I did not see
them; but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my
four-ain'i-twentieth year, 1 had a very strange encounter with them; of
which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months'

interval was very great ; I slept unquietly. dreamed always frightful
ms
dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night. In the (lay.
great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night, I dreamed often
of killing the savages, and of the reasons why 1' might justify doing,r it.
But Lo wave all this for a while--It was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, 1 think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon.
for I marked all upon the post still; 1 say, it was on the sixteenth of May

that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of
lightning and thunder, and a. very foul night it was after it. I knew
not what was the particular occasion of it ; but as I was reading in the
Bible, and taken up with very seflous thoughts about my present condi-
tion, I was surprised with the noise of a. gun, as I thought, fired at sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any I had

177 A A
met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of
another kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a
tricc, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me ; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill the very
moment that a. flash of fire hid me listen for a second gun, which, accord-
ingly, in about half a minute, I heard ; and by the sound, knew that it was
from that part of the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress, and that
they had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these for
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at that
minute, to think, that though I could not help them, it might be they
might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at
hand, and, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill
The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew very
hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was certain, if there was any such
thing as a ship, they must need see it. And no doubt they did; for as soon
as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that several
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till
daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw
something at a great distance at see, full east of the island, whether a sail
or a hull I could not distinguish--no, not with my glass ;' the distance was
so great, and the weather still. something hazy also; at least, it was so
out at sea -

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not
move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran
towards the south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly
been carried away by the current; and getting up there, the weather by
this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the
wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I
found when I was out in my bout ; and which rocks, as they checked the
violence of the stream and made a kind of minder-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition
that ever 1 had been in in all my life. Thus, what is one man's safety is
another man's destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they were,
being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had
been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at ENE

Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not. they

must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore
by the help of their boat; but their firing of!" guns for help, especially when
they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts First, I
imagined that upon seeing my light, they might have put themselves into
their host, and endeavoured to make the shore; but that the sen running
very high, they might have been cast away. Other fimes, I imagined that
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways;
particularly, by the hieaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw
it overbomd with their own hands. Other times, I imagined they had
.some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress they

made, had taken them up, and carried them off. Other times. I fancied
179
they were all gone ofl' to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean,
where there was nothing but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they
might by this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat
one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in,
I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good efl'ect upon my side, that it gave me more
and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably
provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships' companies,
who were new cast away upon this part of the world, not one life should be
spared but mine. I learned here' again to observe, that it is very rare that
the providence of God casts us into any condition so low, or any misery so
great, but we may see something or other to be thankful for, and may see
others in worse circumstances than our own Such certainly was the case
of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any
were saved; nothing could make it rational so much as to Wish or expect
that they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their
being taken up by another ship in company; and this was but mere pos-
sibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance of any such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a strange longing I
felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus :--"0 that
there had been but one or two, nay, or but one soul, saved out of this ship,
to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion, one
fellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to have conversed with l " In all
the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after
the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.

There are some secret springs in the affections, which, when they are set
a-going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered present
to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul,
by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings of the object, that the
absence of it is inaupportahle. Such were these earnest wishiugs that but
one man had been saved. I believe I repeated the words, " O that it had
been but one I " a thousand times; and my desircs were so moved by it, that
when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and my fingers
would press the palms of my hands, so that if I had had any soft thing in
my hand, I should have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head

would strike together, and set against one another so strong, that for some
iso
time I could not part them again.~ Let the naturalists explain these things,
and the reason and manner of them. All I can do is, to describe the fact,
which was even surprising to me when I found it, though I knew not from
whence it proceeded; it was doubtless the ell'ect of ardent wishes, and of
strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort, which the conversa--
tion of one of my fellow Christians would have been to me. But it was not
to be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it; for till the. last year of
my being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved Out of that
ship or no; and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of
a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pockets
but two pieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe--the last was to me of ten times
more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to
this wreck, not doubting but T. might find something on board that might be
useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so much as the possi-
bility that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose life I
mht not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to
the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart that I could not
be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on board
this wreck; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought the
impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted--that
it must come from some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting
to myself if I did not go,

Under the power of this impression, I hastened hack to my castle, pre-
pared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of
fresh water, a. compass to steer by, a. bottle of rum (for I had still a great
deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus, loading myself with
everything necessary, I went down to my hoot, got the water out of her, got
her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more.
My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to sel. up over my head
for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of small
loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's-milk, and a
cheese: all which with great labour and meat I carried to my boat ; and
praying to God to direct my voyge, I put out, and rowing or paddling the-
canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of the island on the>>-

181 '
north-cast side And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran
constantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very
terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before,
and my heart- began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into
either of these currents, I should he carried a great. way out to sea, and
perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again ; and that then, as
my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be
inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my
enterprise; and having hauled my hunt into at little creek on the shore, I
_stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, veryv pensive and
anxious, between four and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing,
I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on; upon
which, my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this, presently
it occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest. piece of ground I could
find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay when
the flood (nine. in, that. I might judge whether, if I was drivcn one way out,
I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same rapidity:
of the currents. This thought was no sooner in myhcad than I cast. my eye
upon a. little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sen both ways, and from
whence I had a clear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which
way I was to guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the current
of ebb set out close by the south point of the island, 50 the current of the
Hood set in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to
do but to keep to the north side of the irland in my return, and I should do
well enough.
' Encouraged by this observation, I resolved, the next- morniug. to set out
with the first, of the tide; and, roposing myself for the night in my canoe,
under the watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a little out
to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit. of the current, which set;
eastward, and which carried me at i). great rate; and yet did not so hurry
me as the current. on the south side had done before, so as to take from me
all government of the boat; but having a strong steel-age with my paddle, I
Went, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I
came up to it. it was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by its
building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks. All the

stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her fore-
132
castle, which stuck in the iwclcs, had run on with great violence, her main-
mast and foremost were brought- by the board--that is to say, broken short
off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and how appeared firm.
When I came close to her, 2:. dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me
coming, yelpad and oried -, and, as soon as I called him, jumped into the see
to come to me, I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with
hunger and thirst. 1 gave him in cake of my bread, and he devoured it like
a. ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow; 1 then
gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let
him, he would have burst himself. A her this I went on board ; but the
first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forewstle
of the ship, with their arms fast- about one another. I concluded, as is
indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea.
broke so high, and so continually over her, that the men were nor able to
bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as
much as if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing
left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I could see, but what
wow spoiled by the water. There were some cesks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water
being ehhcd out, I could see; but the}' were too big to meddle with. I saw
several chests, which, I believe, belonged to some of the seamen; and I got
two of them into the boat, without examining what was in them. Had the
stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken OH, I am persuaded 1
might have made a good voyage ; for, by what I found in these two chests,
I had room to suppose the ship had a. great deal of Wealth on board ; and, if
I may guess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayrcs, or the Rio de la Plate, in the south port of America, beyond
the Brazils to the anmmixh, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to
Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that
time, to anybody ; but what became of the crew I then knew not.

I found, besides these chests, a. little cask full of liquor, of about twenty
gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There were several _
muslcets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds
of powder in it: as for tho muskete, I had no occasion for them, sol left
them, but took the powder-horn. I. took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I
wanted extremely; us also two Little brass kettles, a. copper pot to make
chocolate, and a, gridiron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away,

the tide beginning to make home again: and the same evening, about an
183
hour within night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last
degree I reposed that night in the boat ; and in the morning I resolved to
harbour what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my
castle After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to
examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum,
but not such as we had at the Brazils ; and, in a word, not at all good ; but
when I came to open the chests, I found several things of great use to me :
for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind,
and filled with cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about
three pints each, and were tipped with Sliver. I found two pots of very
good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the saltwater
had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.
I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a
dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths ; the
former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my
face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred
pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of
gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound. In the other chest were some clothes, but of little
value; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's
mate ; though there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed
powder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling--pieces on
occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any
use to me ; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was
to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have given it all for three
or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things I greatly
wanted, but had had none on my feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two
pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two drowned men whom
I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which
were very welcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes, either
for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found
in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I
suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to
belong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had brought from our
own ship ; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship

had not come to my share; for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe
184
several times over with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England,
it might lie here safe enough till I come again and fetch it.

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went
back to my boot, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old
harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old
habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to
repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family afi'nirs ;
and for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I
used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at
any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the east- part of the
island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and where
1 could go without so many precautions, and such a loud of arms and am-
munition as I always carried with me if I went the other way. I lived in
this condition near two years more ; but my unlucky head, that was always
to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all those two
yours filled with projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get
away from this island: for, sometimes I was for making another voyage to
the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing left there
worth the hazard of my voyage ; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes
another: and I believe verily, if I had had the bout that I went from Sallee
in, I should have ventured to see, bound anywhere, I knew not whither. I
have been, in all my circumstances, a. memento to those who are touched
with the general plague of mankind, whence, for ought I know, one-half of
their miseries flow; I mean that of not being satisfied with the station
wherein God and Nature hath placed them: for, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to
which was, as 1'. may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistukes oi' the
some kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable condition;
for had that Providence which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a
planter blessed me with confined desires, and I could have been contented
to have gone on gradually, I might have been by this time--I mean in the
time of my being in this island--one of the most considerable planters in the
Brazils : nay, T. um persuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that
little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I
had remained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidorcs: and
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a. well--stocked plantation,
improving and increasing, to turn supermrgo to Guinea to fetch negroes,
when patience and time would have so increased our stock at home, that we

185 B y;
could have bought them at our own door from those whose business it was
to fetch them 21 and though it had cost us something more, yet the difl'crcnce
of that price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard But as
this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the folly of it is as
commonly the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of
time : so it was with me now ; and yet so deep had the mistake taken root
in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was con--
tinually poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from this
place : and thut I may, With the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the
remaining part of my story, it may not be improper to give some account of
my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and
how, and upon what foundation I acted.

I am now to be supposed retired in my castle, after my late voyage to
the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water,.as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before : I had more wealth, indeed, than I
had before, but was not at all the richer ; for I had no more use for it than
the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards come there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four--and--

~twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude, I was lying
in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health, had no pain, no dis-
temper, no uneasiness of body, not any uneasiness of mind more than
ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no,
not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows :--It is impossible to
set- down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great
thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this night's time : I run over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to
my coming to this island, and also of that part of my life since I came to
this island. In my reflections upon the state of my case since i come on
shore on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of my afiairs in the
first years of my habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care,
which 1 had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the send.
Not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the
while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore
there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions
about it ; my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the some, and
I was as happy in not knowing my danger us ii' 1 had never really been
exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with muny very profitable reflec-
tions, and particularly this one: How infinitely good that Providence is,
186
which has provided, in its government of nmnkind, such narrow bounds to
his sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of so
many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would
distract his mind und sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having
the events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him. \

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came. to reflect
seriously upon the real danger I had been in {Or so many years in this very
island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and with all
possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been between me and the
worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into the hands of cannibols and
savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I would on a
goat or turtle; and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me,
than I did of a pigeon or a curlew. 1 would unjustly slender myself, if I
should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great- Preserver, to whose
singular protection I acknowleged, with great humility, all these unknown
delivcmnees were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into
their merciless hands

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in
considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and
how it came to pass in the World, that the wise Governor of all things
should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity--nay, to something
so much below even brutality itself--as to devour its own kind: but as this
ended in some (at that time) fruit-less speculations, it occurred to me to
inquire, what part of the world these wretches lived in? how for off the
coast was from whence they come? what they ventured over so far from
home for! what kind of boats they had? and why I might not order myself
and my husinm so, that I might be able to go over thither, as they were to
come to Inc?

1 never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with
myself when I went thither; what would become of me il' I fell into the
hands of these savages ', or how I should escape them if they attacked me;
no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and no: he
attacked by some or other of them, without any possibility of delivering
myself: and if I should not fall into their hands, what 1 should do for
provision, or whither I should bend my course : none of these thorghts, l

' say, so much as came in my way : but my mind was wholly bent upon the
m7
notion of my passing over in my hoot to the main hind T looked upon my
present condition as the most miserable that could possibly be ; that I was
not: able to throw myself into anything but death, that could he called
worse; and if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with
relief, or I might. coast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came to
some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief ; and, after all,
perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in
and if the worst'came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an end
to all these miseries at once Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed
mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long continu
ance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the wreck I had
been on board of, and where I had been so near obtaining what I so
earnestly longed for--somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge
from them of the. place where I was, and of the probable means of my
deliverance I was agitated wholly by these thoughts; all my calm of
mind, in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispo-
sitions of Heaven, seemed to he suspended; and I had, as it were, no power
to turn my thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the main,
which came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of desire,
that it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such
violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse heat as
if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my
mind about it, Nature--as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
very thoughts of itr--threw me into a sound sleep. One would have
thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything
relating to it: but. I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as
usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages,
coming to land, and that they brought with them another savage, whom
they were going to kill, in order to eat him ; when, on a sudden, the savage
that they were going to lcill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I
thought, in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove before
my lbrtiiication, to hide himself; and that. I, seeing him alone, and not
perceiving that. the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and
smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he knecled down to me, seeming
to pray me to assist. him ; upon which I showed him my holder, made him
go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant-z and that

as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, " Now I may certainly
188
venture to the main land, for this follow will serve me as a pilot, and will
tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go
for fear of being devoured; What planes to venture into, and what to shun."
I wakcd with this thought; and was under such .iuexpressihle impressions
ofjoy at the prospect of my escape in my dremu, that the disappointments
which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a
dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very
great dejeotion of spirits.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my onlyr way to go
about to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my pos-
session ; and, if possible, it should he one of their prisoners, whom they had
condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts
still were attended with this difiiculty : that it was impossible to effect this
without attueking 8. whole caravan of them, and killing them all ; and this
was not only a very desperate 'uttempt, and might miscarry ; but, on the
other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself; and my
heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for
my deliverance I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me
gainst this, they being the some mentioned before; but though I had other
reasons to offer now, viz. that those men were enemies to my life, and would
devour me if they could ; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree,
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence
as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like ; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my
deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means
reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after many secret
disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all these
arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the
eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mustered all the rest; and
I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost what '
it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was
very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch upon no probable means
for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they
came. on shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the
opportunity should present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as
often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartily tired of it; for it

was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of that time
my .
went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost
every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging,
and began to trouble me. nmch, though I cannot say that it did in this case
(as it had done some time before) wear off the edge of my desire to the
thing; but the longer it Qccmed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it:
in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these savages.
and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.
Besides. I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if
I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I
should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me-
any hurt. It was a great While that I pleased myself with this al'l'air ; but
nothing still presented itself; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing,
for no savages came near me for a great while

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long
musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing. for want of an
occasion to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by
seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island,
and the people who beloged to them all landed and out of my sight. The
number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing
that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a boat, I could not
tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or
thirty men single-handed ; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and discom-
forled. However, I put myself into the same position for an attack that T
had formerly provided, and was just ready for action, if anything had
presented. Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any
noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my
ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual;
standing so, however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that
they could not perceive me by any means, Here I observed, by the help
of my perspective glass. that they were no less than thirty in number; that
they had a. fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had
cooked it, I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I know
not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two
miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they ware laid
by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them
immediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden

sword, for that was their way; and two or three others were at work
190OF 3013" ON CBUSOE.

immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim
was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him. In that
very moment, this poor metal), seeing himself a little at liberty, and.
unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away
from them, and ran with incredible swiftuess along the sands, directly
towards me; I mean, towards that part of the coast where my habitation
was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I perceived
him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body; and now I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove: but
I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the other savages
would not pursue him thither, and find him there. However, I kept my
station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that- there was not
above three men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged, when
I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained
ground on them; so that, if he could but hold out for half an hour, I saw
easily he would fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which I mentioned
often in the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the
ship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither,
'he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; hut, plunging in,
swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereahouts, landed, and ran with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came to the
creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and
that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but went no
farther, and soon after went soitly back again; which, as it happened, was
very well for him in the end. I observed that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that
fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a
companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called by Providence to
save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the ladders with all
possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the foot of
the ladders, as I observed before, and getting up again with the same hash;
to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and having a very short
out, and all down hill, placed myself in the way between the pursucra and

the pursued, hullooing aloud to him that fled. who, looking back, was at
m
first perhaps as much frightened at me as at them; but I beckoned with
my hand to him to come back; and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced
towards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knooked him down with the stock of my piece. I was loath to fire, because
I would not have the rest hem; though, at- that distance, it would not have
been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not
have known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the
other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I
advanced towards him: but. as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had
u how and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot- at me: so I was then obliged
to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The
poor savage who fled, but had stopped. though he saw both his enemies
fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and
noise of my piece, that he stood stock still, andneithcr came forward, nor
went backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come
on. I halloocd again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he
easily understood, and came it little way; then stopped again, and then a
little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to he killed,
as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, and
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he
came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token
of acknowledgment for savilg his life. I smiled at him, and looked
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length, he came
close to me ; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid
his head upon the ground, and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his
head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I
took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But
there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I had
knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to
come to himself: so 1 pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he
was not dead; upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I could
not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; for they
were the first sound of a man's voice that 1 had heard, my own excepted,
for above twenty-five years. But there was no time for such reflections
now ; the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit
up upon the ground, and l perceived that my savage began to be afraid;

out when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I would
' 192uuuws nluvzns numv

shoot him: upon this, my savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to
me to lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt>> by my side, which I
did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow out

01? his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have donp it
198 C c
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had reason
to believe, never saw a. sword in his life before, except their own wooden
swords : however, it seems, as I learned alterwards, they make their wooden
swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even out
oll' heads with them, 33', and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the
sword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand,
laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most, was to know how I killed the other
Indian so fax.- ofl; so, pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go to
him; and I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he
stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one side, then
on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was
just in his breast, where it had made a. hole, and no great quantity of blood
had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to go nway, and
beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that more might come
after them. Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury them
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and
so I made signs to him again to do, so. He fell to work'; and in an instant
he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the
first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered him; and did so by the
other also; I believe he had buried them both in s quarter of an hour.
Then, calling him- away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to
my cave, on the farther part of the island : so I did not let my dream come
to pass in that part, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gavu
him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of Water, which I
found he was indeed in great distress for, from his running: and having
refreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing
him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which
I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; so the poor creature lay down, and
went to sleep. _

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well m'ade, with straight
strong limbs, not. too large, tall and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about
twenty-six years of age, He had a very good countenance, 'not a fierce
and surly aspect, but Seemed to have something very manly in his face;
and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a European in his
countenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and black.

19-1
not. curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great vivacity
and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite
black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as
the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a
bright kind of a. dun olive-colour, that had in it something very agreeable,
though not very easy to describe. His face-was round and plump; his
nose small, not flat like the Negroes ; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his
fine teeth well set, and as. white as ivory.

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he awoke
again, and come out of the cave to me; for I had heen milking my goats,
which I had in the inelosurc just by: when he espied me. he came running
to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible
signs of on humble, thankful disposition, making a grout many untic gestures
to show it. At. last he lays his head fiat upon the ground, close to my foot,
and sets my other foot upon his heud, as he had done before; and after this,
made all the signs to me of Silhiecfion, servitude, and submission, imagin~
able, to let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I under-
stood him in many things, and let him know I was very well pleased with
him. In a little time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
me; and, first, I let- him know his name should be FRIDAY, which was the
day I saved his life: I called him so for the memory of the time. I like-
wise taught him to say Master ; and then let him know that was to be my
name: I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the meaning
of them. 1 gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me
drink it before him, and sop my bread in it ; and gave him a, cake of bread
to do the like, which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was
very good for him. I kept there with him all that night; but, as soon as
it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would
give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked. As we went by the place where he had buried the two men, he
pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had made
to find them again, making signs to me that we should dig them up again
and out them. At this, I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of
it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my
hand to him to come away, which he (lid immediately, with great sub-
mission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to' see if his enemies
were gone; and pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place

where they had been, but no appearance of them or their canoes; so that
195
it was plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them
without any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but having now more
courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me,
giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at. his back,
which I found he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun
for me, and T. two for myself; and away we marched to the plane where
these creatures had been _: for 1 had a mind now to get some fuller in-
telligence of them. "Then I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in
my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle;
indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made
nothing of in Thc place was covered with human bones, the ground dyed
with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten,
mangled, and seomhed; and, in short, all the. tokens of the triumphant
feast they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies I saw
three skulls, live bands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and
abundance of other ports of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs. made me
understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon ; that three
of them were eaten up, and that be, pointing to himself, was the fourth;
that there had been a great battle between them and their next king, of
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great
number of prisoners; all which were carried to several places, by those
who had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done
here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever
remuinud, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon it.
and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a. hankering stomach
after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I showed
so much abhorienc-e at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance
of it. that he durst not discover it: for I had, by some means, let him know
that I would kill him if he offered it I

When he had done this, we came back to our castle ; and there I fell to
work for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen
drawers, which T had out of the hoot gunner's chest I mentioned, which I
found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well;
and then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill would
allow (for T was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I gave him a cap

which I made of hare's skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and
196mason 12mm 11:10.".

'L'hus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well
pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
went awkwaidly in these clothes at first: wearing the di'awois was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat gnlled his shoulders and
the inside of his arms; but a little easing them where he complained they

hum him, and using himself to them, lie took to them at length very well.
197
The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, i began to con-
sider where I should lodge hini ; and, that I might do well for him and yet
be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place
between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside
of the first. As there was a. door or entrance there into my cave, I made a.
formal framed door-case, and a door to it, of boards, and set it up in the
passage, a little within the entrance; and, causing the door to open in the
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too; so that
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost well,
without making so much noise in getting over that it must needs awaken
me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, cover-
ing all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill; which was again
luid across with smaller sticks, instead of lathe, and then thatched OVer a.
great thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at
the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed
a kind of trapdoor, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would
not have opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a greet;
noise: as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But- i
needed none of all this precaution; for never men hud a more faithful,
loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions, snllcnness,
or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his very affections were tied
to me, like those of a child to a father; and I dare say he would have
sacrificed his life to save mine, upon any occasion whatsoever: the many
testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me
that I needed to use no precautions for my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that
however it had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of
the works of His hands, to take from so great a. part of the world of His
creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of their
souls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the same powers,
the same reason, the some inflections; the some sentiments of kindness and
obligation ; the same passions, and resentments of wrongs, the same sense
of gmtitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good, and
receiving good, that He has given to us; and that when He pleases to offer-
them occasions of exerting these, they are as newly, nay, more ready, to
apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed, than we are.
This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several

occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even though we
198
have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit
of God, and by the knowledge of His word added to our understanding,
and why it has pleased Gad to hide the like saving knowledge from so
many millions of souls, who, il' 1 might judge by this poor savage, would
make a much better use of it than we did. From hence, I sometimes was
led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, armign
the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that
sight from some, and reveal it others, and yet expect a like duty from both;
but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, That
we did not know by what light and law these should be condemned; but
that as God was necessarily, and, by the nature of His being, infinitely
holy and just, so it could not be, but if these creatures were all sentenced
'to absence from Himself, it was on account of sinm'ng against that light,
which, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as
their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the formdation was
not discovered to us ; and, secondly, That still, as we all are the clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, " Why hast thou formed
me thus '4 " I

But to return to my new eompanion:~--I was greatly delighted with
him, and made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak,
and understand me when I spoke ; and he was the aptest scholar that ever
was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him. Now my life began to be so easy that
I began to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more savages,
.l cured not if I was never to remove from the place. where I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought
that, in order to bring Friday oh" from his horrid way of feeding, and from
the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I
took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending
to kill a kid out of my own llock, and bring it home and dress it ; but as I
was going, I saw a she~goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday ;---" Hold," said I, " stand still ;"
and made signs to him not to stir: immediately, I presented my piece, shot,
and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance
indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but (lid not know, nor could

imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised; trembled, and shock, and
m
looked so amazed that I thought he would have sunk down. He did not
see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat,
to feel whether he was not wounded; and, us I found presently, thought.
I was resolved to kill him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and
embracing my knees, said a great many things I did not understand;
but I could easily see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm ; and
taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which
I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did : and while
he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded
my gun again, By-and-by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk. sit-ting upon a.
tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I
called him to me gain, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to
my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make
it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird;
accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot
fall He stood like one frightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to
him ; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did not see me put
anything into the gun, but thought that there must be some wonderful
fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, boast, bird, or
anything near or for off; and the astonishment this created in him was
such as could not wear off for a long time; and, I believe, if I would have
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself,
he would not so much as touch it for several days after; but he would
speak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by
himself 3 which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill
him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to
him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed some
time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away a good
distance from the place where she fell: however, he found her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his ignorance about the
gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let
him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that might
present; but nothing more offered at that time: so I brought home the
kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I
could; and having a pot fit for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the

flesh, and made some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, I
200
gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well;
but that which was strangest to him was to see me out salt with it. He
made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a. little
into his own mouth, he seemed to neusente it, and would spit and sputter
at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I
took some meat into my month without salt, and I pretended to spit and
sputter for want of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would
not do; he would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least,
not for a great while, and then but a very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to
feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by
hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in
England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across
the top, and tying the string to 'the cross stick, letting the meat tum
continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came to taste
the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I
could not but understand him : and at last he told me, as well as he could,
he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting it
in the manner I used, to do, as I observed before ; and he soon understood
how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of
it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that, I let him see me
make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time, Friday was able to
do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two months to feed instead of one,
I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of
corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and began
the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only
very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and I told him
what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread, because he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too. He
appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I had
much more labour upon me on his account, than I had for myself; and that
he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place Friday
began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost everything I
had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send him to, and talked
a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my

201 n n
tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before. Besides
the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow
himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature; and on his side, I
believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love
anything before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country
again; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me
almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and suid, " Yes, yes, we
always fight the better; " that is, he. mount, always get the better in fight;
and so we began the following discourse :--

Mttsten--You always fight. the better; how came you to be taken
prisoner then, Friday?

Friday--My nation beat much for all that.

Manon--How heat? If your nation beat them, how come you to be
taken ?

Eiday.--They more many than my nation, in the place where me was;
they take one, two, three, and me: my nation over-heat them in the yonder
place, where me no was ; there my nation take one, two, great thousand.

Maxim--But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your
enemies than? '

Friday--They run, one, two, three. and me, and make go in the canoe;
my nation have no canoe that time.

Medan--Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men
they take? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?

Friday--Yes, my nation eat mans too: out all up.

Masha--mime do they carry them?

Friday--Go to other place, where they think.

.lfaetnr. -Do they come hither?

old-rid g/.--Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else plane.

Medan--mire you been here with them?

Friday--Yes, I have been here (points to the KW. side of the island,
which, it seems, was their side).

By this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly heen among the
savages who used to (101110 on shore on the further part. of the island, on the
same [nan--exiting occasions he was now brought for: and, some. time offer,

when 1 took the courage to carry him to that side, being the some I
202
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he was there
once, when they eat up twenty men, two women, and one child: he could
not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them, by laying so many stones
in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces What follows ; that after
this discourse 1 had with him, I asked him how far it was from our island
to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost ' He told me there
was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but that after a. little way out m sea,
there was at current. and wind, always one way in the morning, thoothcr in
the afternoon. This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide,
as going out or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned
by the great draft and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or
gulph of which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay 5 and that this
land which I perceived to ho W. and N .W. was the great island Trinidad,
on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand
questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what
nations Were ncur: he told me all he know, with the greatest openness
imginable. I asked him the nmnes of the several nations of his sort of
people, but could get no other name than Caribs: from whence I easily
understood that these were the Caribbees, which our maps plucc on the

. part of America which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to
Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up a. great way
beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which must be
west from their country, there dWelt white bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they
had killed much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he
meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the
whole country, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and get
among those white men: he told me, "Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe."
I could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what
he meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant
it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes." This part of Friday's
discourse I began to relish very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes that, one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make
my escape from this place, and that this poor savage might be a. means to
help me.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he

203
began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not. wanting to lay a
foundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly 1 asked him
one time, who made him. The poor creature did not understand me at all,
but thought I had asked who was his father: but I took it up by another
handle, and asked him, who made the son, the ground we walked on, and
the hills and woods. He told me, "It was one Bonnniuckee, that lived
beyond all ;"' he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was
very old, "much older," he said, " than the sea or the land, than the moon
or the stars." I asked him then, if this old person had made all things,
why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and. with a
perfect look of innocence, said, "All things say 0 to him." I asked him, if
the people who die in his country went away anywhere? He said, " Yea;
they all went to Benamuokee" Then I asked him Whether those they eat
up went thither too? He said, " Yes."

From these things, I bgan to instruct him in the knowledge of the true
God: I told him that the grout Maker of all things lived up there, pointing
up towards heaven; that He governed the world by the same power and
providence by which He made it; that He was Omnipotent, and could do
everything for us, give everything to us--lnke everything from us; and
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and
received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent. to redeem us,'
and of the manner of making our pmyeis to God, and His being able to
hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that if our God could hem-
us, up beyond the son, he must needs be a greater God than their Beno-
rnuekee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear till they \rent
up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I asked him if
ever he went thither to speak to him? He said, "No; they never went
that. were young men ; none went (hit-her but the old men," whom he called
their Oowokakee; that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious,
or clergy; and that they went to say 0 (so he called saying prayers), and
then came back and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed,
that there is priestcreft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in
the world ; and the policy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve
the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not only to he found in the
Roman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world,'even among the most
brutish and barbarous savages.

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday ; and told him

that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say 0 to
20C/
their god Benamuckee was a. cheat; and their bringing word from thence

what he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or spake

with any one there, it must he with an evil spirit: and then I entered into.
a long discourse with him about the devil, the origin of him, his rebellion

against God, his enmity to man, the reason ol'- it, his setting himself up in

the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God,

and the many stratagems he made use of to deludc mankind to'their ruin : .
how he had a secret access to our passions and to our affections. and to

adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own

tempmis, and run upon our destruction by our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the
devil as it was about the being of a God: nature assisted all my arguments
to evidence to him even the necessity of a. great First Cause--an overruling,
governing Power--a secret directing Providence; and of the equity and
justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the like; but there ap-
peared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit; of his origin. his
being, his nature; and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw
us in to do so too : and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner.
by a question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say
to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, His
omnipotence, His aversion to sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers
of iniquity; how, as He. had made us nil, He could destroy us and all the
world in a moment; and he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while. After this, I had been telling him how the. devil was God's enemy
in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good
designs of vaidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and
the like. " Well," says Friday, " but you say God is so strong. so great ; is
he not much strong, much might as the devil?" " Yes, yes," says 1,
"Friday; God is stronger than the devil: God is above the devil, and
therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable us
to resist- his temptations and quench his fiery darts." " But," says he again,
" if God much stronger, much might. as the wicked devil, why God no kill
the devil, so make him no more do wicked Z" I was strangely surprised at
this question ; and, after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but
a young doctor, and ill qualified for a casuist, or a. solver of difficulties;
and at first 1 could not tell what to say ; so I pretended not to hear him,
and asked him what he said: but he was too earnest for an answer to

forget his question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words as
205
above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I. said, " God will
at last punish him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be
cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This did not
satisfy Friday -, but he returns upon me, repeating my words, " ' lemme at
(as! ! ' me no understand: but why not kill the devil now; not kill great
ago?" " You. may as well ask me," said 1, "why God does not kill you or
me, when we do wicked things here that ofi'ond him : we are preserved to
repent and he pardoned." He mused some time on this: " Well, well,"
says he, might-113r affectionutoly, " that Well -. so you, I, devil, all wicked, rill
preserve, repent, God pardon a ." Here I was run down again by him to
the last degree: and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of
nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a
God, and of 9. worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the
consequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revolution can form the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us; of :1
Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne; I say, nothing but u revelation from heaven can form these
in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, I moon the Word of God, and the Spirit. of God, promised for the
guide and sanctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary instructors
of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the means of
salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man,
rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out ; then sending
him for something a. good way off, I seriously prayed to God that He would
enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage; assisting, by His Spirit,
the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the know--
ledge of God in Christ reconciling him to Himself, and would guide me to
speak so to him from the Word of God, that his conscience might be con-
vinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again to me,
I entered into u long discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption
of man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel
preached from heaven, viz. of repentance towards God, and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as well as i could why our
blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
Abraham; and how, for that remon, the fallen angels had no share in the
redemption; that he mime- only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,

and the like.

l hao, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods 1i
took for this poor cieatme's instruction, and must wknowlmlge, what I
believe all that act upon the same principle will find, that in laying things:
open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many things that
either I did not know, or had not fully considered' before, but which-
occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for the inform-
ation of this poor savage; and I had. more all'ection in my inquixy after-
things upon this occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether this:
poor wild wretoh was the better for me 01' no, l':_ hugl great reason to be-
t-lmnlzful that ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me; my.
habitation grew comfomtble to me beyond measure: and when I reflected?
that. in this solitary life which I have been confined to, I'had'not only heon:

moved to look up to heaven" myself, and to seekthe haudthat had'bmught:
207
me here, but was now to he made an instrument, under Providence, to save
the life, and, for ought I knew, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him to
the true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he might
know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon
all these things, a secret joy run through every part of my soul, and I
frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I had so
often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have
befulleu me.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time ; and
the conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was
such as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and
completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be formed
in a sublunary state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much better
than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were
equally pcnitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We had here the
Word of God to read, and no farther-off from His Spirit to instruct, than if
We had been in England. I always applied myself, in reading the ScriA
tore, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read; and
he again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I said
before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than 1 should ever
have been by my own more private reading. Another thing I cannot refrain
from observing here also, from experience in this retired part of my life,
viz. how infinite and inexpressible a. blessing it is that the knowledge of
God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid
down in the Word of God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as
the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough
of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere repent-
n-nce for my sins, and laying hold of u Saviour for life and salvation, to a.
stated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God's commands, and
this without- any teacher or instructor, I mean human; so the some plain
instruction sufiiciently served to the enlightening this savage creature.
and bringing him to be such a Christian as l have known few equal to him
in my life.

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which have
happened in the world about religion, whether nicetios in doctrines, or
schemes of Church govermnent, they were all perfectly useless to us, and,
for ought I can yet see, they have been so to the rest of the world. W e had

the sure guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God; and we had, blessed be
208
'God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing by
His word, leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and
obedient to the instruction of His word. And I cannot see the least use
that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of religion, which have
made such confusion in the world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained-it. But I must go on with the historical part of things, and take
every part in its order. _

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he
could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though
in broken English, to me, 1 acquainted him with my own history, or at
least so much of it as related to my coming to this place ; how I had lived
there, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. 1 gave him a knife
which he was wonderfully delighted with ; and I made him a belt, with a
frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog,
instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a
weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon other occasions.

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which
I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave
him an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay ; but she was all beaten in
pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my Whole strength than ;
but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing a great while, and said nothing. i asked him what it was he
studied upon. At last says he, " Me see such hoot like come to place at
my nation." I did not understand him a good while; but, at last, when
I had examined hut-her into it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as
that had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived: that is,
as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently
imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon their
coast, and the boat might get loose and drive ashore ; but was so doll that
I never once thought of men making their escape from a wreck thither,
much less whence they might come: so I only inquired after a description.
-of the boat

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought me better to

understand him when he added with some warmth, " We save the white
209 a 3
3

'r'n'a'ns from drown.' Then I presently asked if there were any white mans,
as he called them, in the boat. "Yes," he said; " the boat full of white
mans" I asked him how many. He told upon his lingers seventeen. I
asked him then what became of them. - He told me, "They live, they
dwell at my nation."

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that
these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the
sight of my island, as I now called it; and who after the ship was struck
on the rock and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their
boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages. Upon this
i inquired of him more critically what was become of them. He assured
me. they lived still. there ; that they had been there about four years ; that
the savages left them alone, and gave them vietuols to live on. I asked
him how it came to puss they did not kill them and eat them. He said,
(' No, they make hmther with them ; " that is, as I understood him, a truce;
and then he added, " They no eat mans but when make the war fight ;"
that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to tight with them,
and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the
hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I had, in a
clear day, discovered the main or continent of America, Friday, the weather
being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a
kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for. I
was at some distance from him. I asked him what was the matter. " 0
joy!" says he; "0 glad! there see my country, there my nation !" I
observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his
eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he
had a minrl to he in his own country again. This observation of mine put
a great many thoughts into me, which made me, at first, not so easy about
my new man Friday as l was before; and I made no doubt but that, ii'
Friday could get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget all
his religion, but all his obligation to me, and would be forward enough to
give his countrymen an, account of me, and come back, perhaps, with a.
hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be
as merry as he used to he with those of his onemics, when they were taken
in war, But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which I
was very sorry alterwanlsi However, as my jealousy increased, and held

me some weeks, I was a little more circmnspect, and not so familiar and
210
kind to him as before: in which I was certainly wrong too; the honest.
grateful creature having no thought about it, but what consisted with the
best principles, both as 9. religious Christian, and us a grateful friend; as
appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may he sure I was every day
pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I
suspected were in him; but I found everything he said was so honest and
so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor
did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not
suspect him of deceit. ,

One day, walking up the same hill. but the weather being hazy at sea,
so that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said, "Friday.
do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own nation '5 " " Yes. '
he said, "' I be much 0 glad to be at my own nation." " What would you
do there Z" said I: " would you turn wild agahi, eat men's flesh again. and
he a savage, as you were before ?" He looked full of concern, and shaking
his head, said, " No, no, Friday tell them to live good ; tell them to pray
God ; tell them to cut corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no eat. man agnin."--
" Why, then," said I to him, "they will kill you." He looked grave at that,
and then said, "No, no, they no kill me, they willing love learn." He
meant. by this, they would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I asked him if he
would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told me that he could not
Swim so far. I told him, I would make a canoe for him. He told me he
would go, if I would go with him. " I go I " says I ; " why they will eat
me if I come there." " No, no," says he, " me make they no out you ; me
make they much love you." He meant, he would tell them how I had
killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make them love me.
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen
white men, or bearded men, as he culled them, who come on shore there
in distress. ,

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I
could possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were
Spaniards and Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find
some method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good
company together, better than I could from an island forty miles off the

shore, alone, and without help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work
211
again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to go
back to his own nation; and, accordingly, I carried him to my frigate,
which lay on the other side of the island, and ham cleared it of water
(for I always kept. it sunk in water), I brought. it out, showed it him, and
we both went into it. 1 found he was a most. dexterous fellow at managing
it, and would make it go almost- as swift again as I could. So when he was
in, I said to him, " Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?" He
looked very dull at my saying so ; which it seems was because he thought
the boat was too small to go so flux 1 then told him I had a bigger; so the
next day I went to the place Where the first heat lay which I had made,
but which I. could not get into the water. He said that was big enough;
but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-
t.\venty years there, the sun had split. and dried it, that it was rotten.
Friday told me such a. heat would do very well, and would carry " much
enough viLLle, drink, brea ~,"----this was his way of talking.

Upon the whole,l was by this time so fixed upon my design of going
over with him to the continent, that l told him we would go and make one
as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word,
but looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the mutter with
him. He asked me again, " Why you angry mad With Friday $--\\'llat me
done?" I asked him what he meant I told him I was not angry with
him at all. "No angry!" says he, repeating the words several times;
" Why send Friday home away to my nation?" "Why," says I, " Friday,
did not you say you wished you were there 7. " " Yes, yes," says he, " Wish
we both there; no wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he
would not think of going there without me. " I go there, Friday ? " says I,
" what shall I do there ?" He turned very quick upon me at this. " You
do gnaw deal much good," says he; " you teach wild mans be good, sober,
tame mans; you tell them know God: pray God, and live new life." "Alas:
Friday-l" says I, "thou knowest not, what thou say-"est; I am but an
ignorant man myself." "Yes, yes," says he, "' you teochee me good, you
teachee them good." " No, no, Friday," says I, "you shall go Without me;
leave mo here to live by myself, as I did before." He looked confused
again at that Word; and running to one of the halchets which he used in
wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. "\Vhat must; I do with
this ?" says i to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. "What must I
kill you for?" said I again. He returns very quick--"What you send
Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke

212nun! snows ma smuzu "raw-021'>>,- L'ub'ums.

so earnestly that I saw tents stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly
discovered the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him,
that I told him then, and often shot, that I would never send him away
from me, if he was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a. settled ofi'ection to -
me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the foundation
of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent nfl'ection to
the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing which, as I had
no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or intention, or desire

of undertaking it. But still I found a. strong inclination to attempting my
213 '
escape, founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse, that there
were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore, without any more delay,
I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and
make it large periogua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were
trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or
canoes, but even of good large vessels; but the main thing I looked at
was, to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was
made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched
upon a tree; for I found he knew much better than I whet kind of wood
was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the true
we cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or heLweeu
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and
smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to
make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools; which,
after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in about
a month's hard labour, we finished it and made it very handsome;
especially, when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat After this,
however,'it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were
inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water: but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to
see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her.
turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we
might venture over in her. "Yes," he said, " we venture over in her very
well, though greet blow wind." However, I had a. farther design the; he
knew nothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her
with an anchor and cable. As to a. must, that was easy enough to get ; so
I pitched upon a straight young cedartree, which I found near the place,
and which there were great plenty of in the ishmd, and I set F riduy to
work to out it down, and gave him directions how to shape and order it,
But- as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails,
or rather pieceeof old sails, enough: but as I. had had them now six--und-
twcnty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not
imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not
doubt hut they were all. rotten ; and, indeed, most of them were so. How-
ever, T found two pieces, which appeured pretty good, and with these I
went to work; and with a great deal of pains, and awkward stitching, you

214
may be sure, for want of needles, I at length made a thine-cornered ugly
thing, like what we call in England a sliouldcr-of-mutton sail, to go with
a boom at bottom, and u little SllOl't sprit at the top, such as usually our
ships long-boats sail with, and such as I best know how to manage, as it
was such a one as 1 had to the boat in which I made my escape from
Barbary, as related in the first part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and
fitting my mast- and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a
small stay, and a sail, or foresail to it, to assist if we should turn to wind-
ward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to
steer with. I was but u bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness,
and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so much pains to
do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though, considering the many (lull
eonl'rivanccs I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much
labour as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what
belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he knew very well
how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a
rudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and
again in the sea. by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this way
or that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he
stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I made
all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except
that of the compass I could make him understand very little. 0n the
other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never
any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing
the stars were always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in
the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by land
or sea. '

I was now entered on the seven-and--twentieth year of my captivity in
this place; though the three last years that I had this creature with me
ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of
another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of
my landing here with the some thanlcfulncss to God for His mercies as at .
first: and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more
so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over
me, and the great hopes I had of being efl'ectuslly and speedily delivered;

for I had on invincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance
- 215
was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this place. I went
on, however, with my husbandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as usual.
I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, when I kept more
within doors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure
as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the
begimiing, I landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling her up to the
shore ut high water-mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough
to float in; and then, when the title was out, we made a strong dam across
the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry as to the tide from
the sea: and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of t' see, so
thick that she was as well thatched as a house; and thus we waited for
the months of November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure.

When the settled season bgan to come in, as the thought of my design
returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage. And
the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being
the stores for our voyge; and intended in a week or a. fort-night's time, to
open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and hid him to go to the
scarshore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we
generally got'once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh.
Friday had not been long gone when he came running back, and ilew over
my outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he
set his feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me,
" 0 master! 0 master! 0 sorrow! 0 bad ! "---"W'hat's the matter, Friday?"
says I. "O yonder there," says he, " one, two, three canoes; one, two,
three!" By this way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but on
inquiry I found there were but three. " Well, Friday," says I, " do not be
frightened." So I heartened him up as well as I could. However, I saw
the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in his head but
that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces and eat
him; and the poor follow trembled so that I scarcely knew What to do with
him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told him 1 was in as much
dunger as he, and that. they would eat [no as well as him. " But," says 1,
" Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?" "Me

shoot," says be, "but there come many great number." " No matter for
218 .
that," said I, again; "our guns .will fright them that we do not kill.' So
I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and
stand by me, and do just as I hid him. He said, "Me die, when you bid
die, master-3" So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him;
for I had been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left.
When he had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieccs, which we
always carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small
pistol-bullets. Then 1 took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs,
and five small biillets each; and my two pistols T loaded with a brace of
bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and
gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could
discover; and I found quickly by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole business
seemed to be the triumphant; banquet upon those three human bodies; a
barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than, as I had observed, was
usual with them. I observed also, that they had landed, not whom they
had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the
shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea.
This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretohcs came
about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again to Friday,
and told him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and
asked him if he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, and
his spirits being a little raised with the drain I had given him, he was very
cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when 1 bid die.

In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,
between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns myself ;i
and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets ; and as
to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot,
or do anylhing till I bid him, and in the mean time not to speak a word.
Tinthis posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as
well to get. over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come.
within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my
glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began
to abate my resolution :---I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their

217 p F
number, for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was
superior to them--nay, though I had been alone But it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what- nccesslt-y, l was in to
go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done or
intended me any wrong? who, as to me, were. innocent, and whose barbarous
customs were their own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's
having left firem, with the other nations of that p: rt of the world, to such
stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me to lake upon
me to be. a judge of their (Killfinii, much less an executioner of His justice,
----tha.t whenever He thought lit He would take the cause into His own
hands, and by national vengeance punish them as a. people for national
crimes, but that, in the mean time, it was none of my l)usiucss,-----tllat it
was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in
a state of war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for him
to attack them--hut I could not say the some with regard to myself.
These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I
went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near thorn that I
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would not then as God
should direct; but that unless something offered that; was more a call to
me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with ah possible wariness
and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched till 1 came to the
skirt of the wood on the'side which was next. to them, only that one corner
of the wood lay between me and them. Hero I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great. tree which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there plainly what
they were doing. He did so, and came immediately back to me, and told
me they might be plainly viewed there--that they were all about their fire
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay hound upon
the sand :1 little from them, whom he said they would kill next; and this
fired the very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their nation,
but one of the bearded men he had told me of, that came to their country
in the boat I was filled with horror at the very naming of the white
bearded men; and going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white
man, who lay upon the beach of the see with his hands and his feet tied
with (lags, or things like rushes, and that he was an European, and had
clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
5213onncoz A31) "mu? anal. Isms rm: SAVAGE

nearer to them than the place where l was, which, by going a. little way
about, I saw 1 might come at undiscovered, and that then I should be
within half a. shot of them ; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed
enraged to the highest degree; and going buck about twenty paces, I got
behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree,
nnd then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full View of them
nt-the distance of about eighty yards

I had now not a moment- to luso, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches
sat upon the ground, all close huddled mgebher, and hud just sent the other
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb to
their fire, and they were. steeping down to untie the hands at his feet. I
turned to Friday :--" Now, Friday," said I, " do as I hid thee" Friday said
he would. " Then, Friday," says I, " do exactly as you see me do ; fail in
not-hing" So 1 set down one of the muskets and the fowling--piece upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket I
took my aim at the Suvzges, bidding him to do the like ; than asking him
if he was ready, he said, "Yes." "Then fire at them," said I; and at the

same moment I fired also.
219
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he
shot he killed two of them, and wounded thrco more; and on my side I
killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may he sure, in a dreadful
consternation; and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their feet,
but (lid not immediately know which way to run, or which way to look, for
they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes
close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I (lid ; so, as
soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the
fowling-pioce, and Friday did the like; he saw me cock and present; he
did the same again. "Are you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," says her
" Let fly, then," says I, "in the name of God l" and with that I fired again
among the amazed wretches. and so did Friday; and as our pieces were
now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found
only two drop ; but so many were wounded, that they run about yelling
and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them miserably
wounded ; whereof three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.

"Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking
up' the musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," which he did with a '
great deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed
myself, and Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me,
1 shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as fast
as I could, which by the way was not very fast, being loaded with arms us
I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying
upon the beach or shore, bet-ween the place where they sat and the sea
The two butchers who were just going to work with him had left him at
the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea--side, and
had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way.
I turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards and fire at them ; ho under-
stood me immediately, and running about forty yards, to he nearer them.
he shot at- them ; and I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all
fall of a, hcao into t-he'boat, though I saw two of them up again quickly;
however, he killed twa of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down
in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut
the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I
lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He
answered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that. he could

scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it
220
him, making signs that he should drink", which he did; and I gave him a
piece of hmul, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was :
and he said Espagniolc; and being a little recovered, let me know, by all
the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his
deliverance. " Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up,
" we will talk afterwards, but We must fight now: if you have any strength
left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you" He took them very
thankfully ; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they
had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like u firry, and
had out two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, us the whole
was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much frightened with
the noise of our pieces that they fell down for more amazement and fear,
and had no more power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had
to resist our shot: and thatwas the case of those live that Friday shot at
in the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they received, so the
other two hall with the fright.

I kept. my piece in my hand still without- liring, being willimg to keep
my chm-go ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword:
so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first
fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been disoharged, which
he did with great swift-ness ; and then giving him my musket, I sat down
myself to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, therelmppencd a fierce engage
ment between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with
one. of their great wooden swords, the weapon thnt was to have killed him
before, if I had not prevented it The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave
as could be imagined, though weak, had fought the Indian 21 good while, '
and had out two great wounds on his head; hut the savage being a stout,
lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and
was wringing my sword out of his hand; when the Spaniard, though under-
most, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the
savage through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was
running to help him, could come near him.

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, with
no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he dcspatchcd those
three who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the
rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a. gun, I

savages, and wounded them both ; but, as he was not able to run, they both
got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one ol
them, but the other was too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded
yet had plunged himself into the sea, and sworn with all his might off to
those two v(<<rho were left in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped
our hands, of one-and--twenty. The uceouut- of the whole is as follows :--
' three killed at our first shot from the tree; two killed at the next shot;
two killed by Friday in the boat; two killed by lh'iday of those at first
wounded ', one killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard;
four killed, being found dropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed
by Friday in his chase of them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one
wounded, if not deod--twenty--onc in all.

Those that. were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot, and
though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would [him have had me take one of their canoes,
and pursue them ; and, indeed, I was very anxious about their cseupe, lest,
carrying the news home to their people, they should come back perhaps

with two or three hundred of the canoes. and devour us by mere multitude;
22a.
so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes,
I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ; but when I was in the canoe, I
was surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot,
as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not
knowing what was the matter; for he had not been able to look up over
the side of the heat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied
so long, that he had really but little life in him.

1 imrnediately'cut the twisted fl; gs or rushes, which they had bound him
with, and would have helped him up, but he could not stand or speak, but
grooned most piteously, believing, it. seems, still, that he was only unbound
in order to he killed When Friday came to him, 1' bade him speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him give
the poor wreteh a. dram; which, with the news of his being delivered.
revived him, and he sat up in the host But when Friday come to hear
him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to
have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head; and then sung and jumped about again like
a distracted creature. It was a good while before i could make him speak
to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when he came a little to him-
self, he told me that it was his father,

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and
filial alieotiou had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father,
and of his being delivered from death ; nor, indeed, can I describe half the
extravagances of his affection alier this ; for he went into the boat, and out
of the boat, a greet many times: when he went in to him, he would sit
down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom
for many minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and still' with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them
with his hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some ruin
out of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good.

This affair put. an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other
savages, who were now almost out of sight ; and it was happy for us that
we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they
could he got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hand all
night, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I could
not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their own coast.

But to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his lather, that I could
22:3
not find in my heart to take him off for some time: but after T thought he
could leave him a little, I called him to ine, and he came jumping and
laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then I asked him if he had
given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, " None; ugly
dog out all up self." I then gave him a coke of bread, out of n. little pouch
I carried on purpose; I also gave him a drum for himself; but he would
not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket. two or three
bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He had
no sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat,
and run away as if he had been hewitohed, for he was the swittest fellow
on his feet that ever I saw : I say, he ran at'such a rate that he was out of
sight, as it were, in an instant; and though 1 called, and hallooed out too,
after him, it was all one--away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I
saw him come book again, though not so fast as he Went; and, as he came
nearer, 1 found his pace slacker, because he had something in his hand.
When he came up to me, 1 found he had been quite home for an earthen
jug or pet, to bring his father some fresh water, and that he had got two
more cakes or leaves of breed: the bread he gave me, hut the water he
carried to his father 3 however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of
it The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had
given him, for he was fainting with thirst

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any '
water left: he said "Yes g" and I bade him give it' to the poor Spaniard,
who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes,
that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and
was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree; and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with the rude
bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming
to him with the water, he sat up and drunk, and took the bread and hogan
to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of raisins: he looked up in
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear
in any countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon his feet: he tried to
do it two or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were so swelled
and so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's.

I observed the poor afleetionate creature; every two minutes, or perhaps

less, all the while he was here, turn his head about, to see if his father was
224
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at lust he found
he was not. to be seen; at which he started up, and, without speaking a
word, flew with that. swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his
feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he come, he only found
he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me
presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if
he could, and lead him to the boot, and then he should carry him to our
dwelling, where I would take care of him But Friday, a lusty strong
fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back, and carried him away to the boot,
and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet
in the inside of it ; and then lifting him quite in, he set him close to his
father; and presently stepping out 2 train, launched the boat>> off, and paddled
it along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too ; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in
the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to
him, and asked him whither he went. He told me, " Go fetch more heat :"
so away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him;
and he haxl the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by
land; so he waited me over, and then went to help our new guests out of
the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to walk; so
that poor Friday knew not what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday
to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a.
kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both
up together upon it between us.

but when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we
were at o. worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over,
and 1 was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again, and
Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a. very handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that and the grove of young
wood which I had planted ; and here we made them two beds of such
things as I had; viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie
on. and another to cover them, on each hed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in sub-
jects ; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like
a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my own property,
so that I had an undoubted right of dominion Secondly, my people were

225 G G
perfectly subjected: I was absolutely lord and lawgiver: they all owed
their lives to me, and were ready to lay down their liyes, if there had been
occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects,
and the}r were of three different religions: my man Friday was a Protestant,
his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a. l'npist
However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my dominions :--But
this is by the way.

As soon as I haxl secured my two week rescued prisoners, and given
them shelter, and a. place to rest them upon, I began to think of making
some provision for them: and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday [0 take
a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular (lock, 1.0 he
killed; when I cut off the hinder-qlm'ter, and chopping it into small pieces,
. I set Friday to work to boiling and starving, and made them a very good
dish, I assure you, of flesh and lnoth ; and as I cooked it withoubdoors, for
I made no fire within my inner wall, so T curried it all into the new tent,
and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and ate my own dinner
also with them, and, as well as T could, cheered them and encouraged
them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed,
to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages
pretty \velL

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of
the ounces, and go and fetch our muskets and other lire-arms, which, for
want of time, we hurl left upon the plane of battle; and, the next day, I
ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open
to the sun, and would presently be ofl'cnsivc. I also ordered him to bury
the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not think of
doing myself : nay, 1 could not hear to see then), if I went that way; all
which he pulled-null}r performed, and eli'aced the very appearance of the
savages being there; so that when I wont again, I could scarce know where
it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects;
and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his {other what he thought of the
escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return
of them, with a power too grout for us to resist Ills first opinion was, that
the savages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that
night they went 03', but must, of necessity, be drowned, or driven south to
those other shores, where they were as sure to be devorued as they were
to be drowned if they were cast away; but, as to what they would do

226
if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but, it was his opinion,
that they were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being
attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell the people
they were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man;
and that the two which appeared, viz. Friday and I, were two heavenly
spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons.
This, he said he know; because he heard them all cry out so, in their
language, one to another; for it was impossible for them to conceive that
a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without
lifting up the hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in the
right; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages never
attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified with
the accounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the
sea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be
destroyed with fire from the gods. This, however. I knew not; and there-
fore \vvs under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always
upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were new four of us,
I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field,
at any time,

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their
coming wore ofi' ; and I began to take my former thoughm of a voyage to
the main into consideration; being likewise assured, by Friday's father,
that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if
I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I. had a. serious
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were sixteen
more of his countrymen and Portuguese,'who having been cast away and
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the
savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life.
I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they were a
Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, being
directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver,
and to bring back what European goods they could meet with there ; that.
they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another
wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when first the ship was
lost, and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, and
arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have
been devoured every moment. He told me they had some arms with

them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder
227
nor ball, the washing of the see having spoiled all their powder, but a
little, which they used at. their first lending, to provide themselves with
some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they
had formed (my design of making their escape. He said they had many
consultations about it; but that having neither vessel, nor tools to build
one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in terms and
desoair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from
me, which might. tend towards an escape; and whether, if they were all
here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their
TI'BAChery and ill.ugage of me, il' 1 put my life in their hands; for that
gratitude was no inherent- virtue in tho nature of man, nor did men always
square their dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as they
did by the advantages they expected. I told him it would be very hard
that I should be the instrument of their dclivciunce, and that they should
afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman
was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident socvcr
brought him thither; and that I had rather he delivered up to the surges,
and be devoured alive, than fell into the merciless claws of the priests, and
be carried into the Inquisition. I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded,
if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build it bnrquc huge
enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils southward, or to tho
islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in requital, they should,
when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by forcc among their
own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my
case worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their
condition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he
believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that
should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if T pleased, he would
go to them, with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and
return again, and bring me their answer; that. he would make conditions
with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under
my direction, as their commander and captain; and they should swear
upon the holy scormnents and gospel, to be true to me, and go to such
Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed
wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in such

country as I intended; and that he would bring a contract from them
2-28
under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me he would first swear
to me himself, that he would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I
gave him orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his
blood, il' there should happen the least breach of faith among his country-
men. He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and they
were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out
of all hopes of ever returning to their own country ; and that he was sure,
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible,
and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But
when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started
an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in
it; and, by his advice, put 013' the deliverance of his comrades for at least
half a year. The case was thus : he had been with us now about a. mouth,
(luring which time 1 had let him see in what manner I had provided, with
the assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what
stock of corn and rice 1 had laid up; which, though it was more than
sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good husbandry, for
my family, now it was increased to four; but much less would it be
sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should
come over; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if
we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of
America; so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him
and the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could
spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we might
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come; for
want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think them-
selves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. " You
know," says he, " the children of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for
their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself,
that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the wilderness."

His caution was so seasonablc, and his advice so good, that I could not
but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with
his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden
tools we were furnished with permitted ; and, in about a month's time, by

the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and
229
trimmed up, as we sowed two-und~twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen
jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare: indeed, we
left ourselves barely sufficient. for our Own food for the six months that we
had to expect our crop; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our
seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the
ground in that country.

Having new society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us
out of fear of the savages, if they bod come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found occasion ;
and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was ini--
possible. at least for me, to have the moons of it out or mine. For this
purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and
I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I caused the
Spaniard, to whom I imported my thoughts on that afl'uir, to oversee and
direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains 1 had
hcwed a. large tree into single planks, um] I caused them to do the like, till
they made about a. dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad,
thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick: what pro--
digious labour it took up, any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats
as much as I could ; and for this purpose, I made Friday and the Spaniard
go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our
turns), and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with
the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added
them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing the grapes coming
on, I caused such a. prodigious quantity to he hung up in the sun, that, I
believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we
could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our breed, formed
it great part of our food--very good living, too, I assure you, for they are
exceedingly nourishing.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most
plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to
answer our end; for, from twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in and
thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in
proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or,
if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victnalled

our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say, any part-
2:10
of America. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn1
we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we
kept it ; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and
often blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind
of work ,' but I suw no need of it.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I
gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what- ho could do
with those he had left behind him them. I gave him a strict charge not to
bring any mun who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and the
old savage, that he would in no way injure, fight with, or attack the person
he should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them in order
to their deliverance; but that they would stand by him and defend him
ugainst- all such attempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under
and subjected to his command ; and that this should beput in writing, and
signed in their hands. How they were to have done this, when I know they
had neither pen nor ink, was a. question which we never asked. Under
these instruct-ions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday,
went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to have come in,
or rather were. brought in, when they came as prisoners to he devoured by
the savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a iirelock on it, and about
eight charges of powder and ball, changing them to be very good husbands
of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions,

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view
of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. 1 gave
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for
many days,- and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time;
and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, ugreeing with them about
a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should know
them again, when they came back, at a. distance, before they came on shore.
They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, by
my account in the month of October; but us for an exact reckoning of
days, after I had once. lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had I
kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I was right;
though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account, I found I
had kept a. true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange
and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been

hand of in history. I was fast asleep in my lmwh one 'morning, when my
231
man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, " Hawker, master, they
are come, they are come 1 " I jumped up, and, regardless of (longer, I went

- as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by
the way, was by this time grown to be in very thick wood ; 1 aay,'regiudless
of danger, I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do : but
I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw u. boat at
about a league and a hull" distance, standing in for the shore, with a
sboulder-of-mutton soil, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to
bring them in-: also I observed, presently, that they did not come from that
side which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island.
Upon this I called Friday in, and bade hirn lie close, for these were not the
people we looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were
friends or enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them ; and, having taken the ladder out,
I climbed up to the top of the hill, as 1' used to do when l was apprehensive
of anything, and to take my view the pluiner, without being discovered. I
had scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a
ship lying at anchor, at about Lwo leagues and a. hull' distance from me,
SSE, but not above a league and a. half from the shore. By my observation,
it appeared plainly to be on English ship, and the boat appeared to be an
English long'boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a ship,
and one that. I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen,
and consequently friends, was such asI cannot describe; but yet I had some
secret doubts hung about me--I cannot tell from whence they came---
bidding me keep upon my guard. In the fist place, it occmred to me to
consider what business on English ship could have in that. part of the
world, sinee it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the
English had any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive
them in them, in distress; and that: if they were really English, it was most
probable that they were here upon no good design ; and that. I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which some-
times ere given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being
real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that have
made any observations of things can deny ; that they are certain discoveries
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if-

the tendency of them seems to he to warn us of danger, why should we not
932
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior
and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are given for our good?

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this
reasoning; for had 1 not been made cautious by this secret admonition,
come it from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in it far
worse condition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept
myself long in this posture, till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if
they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing;
however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not see the little
inlet. where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon
the beach, at about half a mile from me ; which was very happy for me ;
for otherwise they Would have landed just- at my door, as I may say, and
would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered
me of all I had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were
Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were Dutch, but
it did not. prove so ; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I
found were unarmed, and, as I thought, hound ; and when the first four or
[ire of them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the boat,
as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive using the most passionate
gestures of entrcuty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and
appeared concerned indeed, but not in such a degree as the first. I was
perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it
should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he coulc , " 0
master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans." "Why
Friday,"-says I, " do you think they are going to eat them, then ? "--" Yes,"
says Friday, " they will eat t.hem."--"No, no," says I, "Friday; I am
afraid they will murder them, indeed; but. you may be sure they will not
eat them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but
stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when
the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains
lift up his arm with a great cutlass, us the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him full evtny moment;
at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I
wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with
him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might- have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they had

233 g H
among them; but it fell out to my mind another way. After I had observed
the outmgeous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, l observed
the fellows run scattering about the island, as i!" thcy wanted to see the
country I observed that the three other men had liberty to go also where
they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive,
and looked like men in despair. T his put me in mind of the first time
when I came on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave myself
over for lost; how wildly I looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions
I had; and how I lodged in the true all night, for fear of being devoured
by Wild beasts. As I knew nothing, that night, of the supply I was to
receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the
storms and tide, by which I have since been so long nourished and sup~
ported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of
deliverance and supply they were, bow near it was to them, and how
eltectually and really they were in a condition of safety, at the same time
that they thought themselves lost, and their case desperate. So little do
we see before us in the world, and so much reason have We to depend
cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His
creatures so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst circumstances, they
have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes urn nearer
deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance
by the means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction.

It was just at high water when these people came on shore; and while
they rumbled about to see what- kind of a place they were in, they had
carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ehhed consider-
ably away, leaving their boat. aground. They had left two men in the boat,
who, as I found afterwards, having dnuik a little too much brandy, fell
asleep; however, one of them waking a. little sooner than the other, and
finding the boat too fast mground for him to stir it, halloocd out for the rest,
who were struggling about; upon which they all soon came to the boat:
but. it was past all their strength to launch her, the hoot being very heavy,

' and the shore on that side being is soft oozy sand, almost. like a quiekszuul.
in this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all man-
kind given to forethought, they gtwc it over, and away they strolled about
the country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling
them ofl' from the hoot, " Why, let her alone, Jock, can't you? she'll float
next tide;" by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what
countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not once

23;
daring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation,
near the top of the hill: and very glad I was to think how well it was for-
tified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could float
again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might be ut more liberty
to see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any. In the
mean time, T fitted myself up for a, battle, as before, though with more
caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at
first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with
his gun, to load himself with arms. 1 took myself two hurling-pieces. and T
gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked
sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a. gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it
was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that
they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down
to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to
get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a great tree, at;
about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of
the rest Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn some-
thing of their condition -, immediately I marched as above, my man Friday
at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not
making quite so storing a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them
undiscovered as I could, and then, before any of them saw me, I called
aloud to- them in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?" They started up
at the noise, but were ten times more confounded when they saw me, and
the uncouth figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought
I perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in Eng.
lish: " Gentlemen," said I, " do not be surprised at me ; perhaps you may
have a friend near, when you did not expect it." " life must be sent directly
from Heaven then," said one of them very gmvely to me, and pulling ofl'
his hat at the same time to me; "for our condition is past the help of
man." " All help is from Heaven, sir," said I: " but can you put a stronger
in the way to help you? for you seem to be in some great distress. I saw
you when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to the
b'rutes that more with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you."
The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looked
like one astonished, returned, " Am I talking to God, or man? Is it a real

man, or an angel 2 "---" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I; "if God had
235
sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed
after another manner than you see me ; pray lay aside your fears; I am a
man, an Euglishnmn, and disposed to assist you ; you see I have one 501'-
vant, only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve
you? What is your case?" " Our case, sir," said he, "is too long to tell
you, while our murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was com-

this desolate place, with these two men with me,---oue my mate, the other
a passenger, where we expected to perish, believing the place to be unin-
habited, and know not yet what to think of it." "Where are these brutes,
your enemies?" said I ; " do you lmow where they are gone?" "There
they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; "my heart trembles for
fear they have seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, they will cer-
tainly murder us ail." " Have they any fire-arms?" said I. He answered,
" They had only two pieces, one of which they lefl. in the boat." " Well,

then," said I, "lnave the rest 1.0 me ; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy
23:;
thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them prisoners? ' He told
me there w ere two desperate v illains among them that it was scaiee safe to
show any mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the 1est
would rct111n to theii' duty. I asked him which they weie. He told me
he could not at that distance distinguish them, but he would obey my
orders in anything I would direct, "Well," says I, " let us retreat out of
their View or hearing, lest they awake, and We will resolve further." So
they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.

"Look you,si1," said I, "if I \enture upon your deliverance, are you
willing to make two conditions \1 1th me?" He anticipated my p1oposals
by telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered should be wholly
diiected and commanded by me in evcrvthing , and if the ship was not
recovered, he would live and die with me in what pint of the world soever
I would send him ; and the two other men said the same. " Well," says 1,.
"my conditions are but two ; first--that while you stay in this island with
me you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in your
hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no pre-
judice to me or mine upon this island, and in the mean time be governed
by my orders; secondly ,---th'1t if the ship is or may he recovered, you will
carry me and my man to England passage free."

- He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could
devise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and
besides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as
long as he lived. "Well then," said I "here are three muskets for y,ou
with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is Proper to he done."
He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able, but offered
to be wholly guided by me I told him I thought it was hard ventuling
anything; but the best method I could think of was to fire on them at once
as they lay, and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to
submit, we might save them, and so put it. wholly upon God's providence
to direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill them,
if he could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had
been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we
should be undone still, for they would go on board and bring the whole
ship's company, and destroy 11s all. " Well, then," says I, " necessity legi~
timates my advice, for it is the only way to save our lives." However,
seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go them-
selves, and manage as they found convenient.

237
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon
after we saw two of them on their foot. I asked him if either of them were
the heads of the mutiny? He said, "No." "Wcll, then," said I, "you
may let them escape; und Providence seems to have awakened them on
purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, "if the rest escupc you, it is
your fault." Animated with this, he took the musket. I had given him in
his hand> and a. pistol in his lnelt, and his two comrades with him, with
each a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going {inst made.
some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and
seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for the
moment he cried out they fired-I mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece. rl'hey had so well aimed their shot at the men
they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other very
much'woundcd ; but not being (lead, he started up on his foot, and called
eagerly for help to the other ; but the captain stepping to him, told him it
was too late to cry for help, lie-should call upon God to forgive his villany,
and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so
that he never spoke more ; there wcrc three more in the company, and one
of them was slightly wounded. By this time I was comc ; and when they
saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy.
The captain told them he would spare their lives if they would give him an
assurance of their abhorrcnce of the treachery they had been guilty of, and
would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in
carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all
the protestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was
willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not against,
only that I obliged him to keep thcm bound hand and foot while they
were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the bout,
with orders to secure her, and bring away the ours and sails, which they
did; and hy--and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for them)
parted from the rest, came back up0n hearing the guns fircd; and seeing
the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also -, and so our victory was complete,

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one
anoihcr's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history,
which he heard with an attention oven to amazement--mud particularly

at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and zunnur
m
nition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it alleoted
him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tours
run down his face, and he could not speak a word more. After this
communication was at an end, 1 carried him and his two men into my
apartment, leading them in just where I came (nut, viz., at the top of the
house, where I refreshed him with such provision as 1 had, and ahou-'Bd
them all the uontrivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting
that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but
above all, the captain admired my ibrtiflr-ntion, and how perfectly I had
concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been now planted
nearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,
was become u little wood, so thick that it was impassable in an)r part of it
but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage into it,
I told him this was my castle and my residence, but thatl had a seat in the
country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would show him that too another time; but at present our business was to
consider how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told
me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were
still six-and-twcnty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be
hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it; on, knowing that if
they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and that, therefore,
there would be no attacking them with so small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a very
rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on
speedily, as well to thaw the men on board into some snare for their
surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon
this, it presently occurred to me that in a. little while the ship's crew,
wondering what. was become of their comrades and of the boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and that then,
perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed
to be rational, Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to
stave the bout, which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her
oil; and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be

fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the arms which were left
239
On board out of her, and whatever else we found there--which was a bottle
of ibrandy, and another of rum, a few hiscuitreakes, a horn of powder, and u
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was live or six pounds);
all which was very welcome to me, especiully the brandy and sugar, of
which I had had none left for many years.

When we had curried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail, und
rudder of the boat were carried away before , we knocked a great hole in
her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they
could not carry off the boat Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that
we could be able to recover the ship; but my View was, that if they went
away without the boat, I did not much question to make her again fit to
carry us to the Leeward lslands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards
in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main
strength, heaved the bout upon the beach, so high that the tide would not
float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in her
bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we
should do, we hezml the ship fire a gun, and make a wait with her ensign
as a signal for the boat to come on board: but no bout stirred; and they
fired several times, making other signals for the boat. At last, when all
their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not
stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and
row towards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that there were
no less than ten men in her, and that they had fire--arms with them

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view
of them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the
tide having set them a little to the east- of the other boat, they rowed up
under shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed, and
where the boot lay; by this means, I say, we had a full View of them, and
the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of
whom, he said, there were tlnee very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were
led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but
that as for the boa-stain, who it seems was the chief officer among them,
and all the rest, they were as outrageous us any of the ship's crew, and were
no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise ; and terribly apprehensive
he was that they would be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told
him that men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that

seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which we
240
were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him What he
thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a. deliverance were not
worth venturing for? "And where, sir," said I, "is your belief of my being
preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a. little
while ago? For my part," said I, " there seems to be but one thing amiss
in all the prospect of it." "What is that?" says he. " Why," said I, "it is,
that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them, which
should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should
have thought God's providence had singled them out to deliver them into
your hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own,
and shall die or live as they behave to us." As I spoke this with a raised
voice and cheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we
set vigorously to our business.

We had, upon the first appearance of the hosts coming from the ship,
considered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them
effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday. and one of the three delivered men, to my
cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods, if they could have
delivered themselves: here they left them bound, but gave them provisions;
and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their
liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their escape, they
should he put to death without mercy. They promised faithfuuy to hear
their confinement with patience, and were very thankful that they had such
good usage as to have provisions and light left them ; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not
know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were kept pinioned,
indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them ; but the other two
were taken into my service, upon the captain's recommendation, and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so With them and the.
three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt
we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,
considering that the captain had. said there were three or four honest men
among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other bout
lay, they run their boat into the bench and came all on shore, hauling the

bout up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would
- 241 r I
tut-her have left the hunt at an anchor some distance from the shore, with
some hands in her, to gum-(l her, and so we should not be able to seize the
boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they mu all to their other
boat; and it was easy to see they were under it great surprise to find her
stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or three great
shouts, hallooiug with all their might, to try if they could make their
companions hear; but all was to no purpose: then they came all close in o
ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and
the echoes made the woods ring: but it was all one; those in the cave, we
were sure, could not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it
well enough, yet dnrst give no answer to them. They were so astonished
ltl- the surprise of this, that, us they told us afterwards, they resolved to go
all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men Were all
murdered, and the "long--bout stared -, accordingly, they immediately launched
their boat. again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing
they would go on hoard the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes
we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the
other way. ,.

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them
all coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,
which it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in the
boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for
their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a
loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no
advantage to us if we let the boat escape ; because they would row away to
the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and
so our recovering the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but
to wait and see what the issue of things might present. The seven men
came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it
was impossible for us to come at them in the boat Those that came on
shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the little hill under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though they
could not perceive us. We should have been very glad if they would have

come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them, or that they would
242TUB slum!!! CALI. 'm mam 0031mm

have gone farther off, that we might come abroad. But when they were
come to the brow of the hill where they could see a gust way into the
valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east port, and where the
island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary : and not
caring, it seems, to venture for from the shore, nor far from one another,
they sat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought fit
to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had
done the job for us ; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell What the danger was they
had to fear.

The captain made a, very just proposal to me upon this consultation of
theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley gain, to endeavour to
make their fellows 11.511, and that we should all sally upon them just at the
juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly

yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal.
M3
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to them before
they could load their pieces again. But this event did not happen; and
we lay still a long time, very irresolute what course to take. 'At length, I
told them there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night- ; and then,
if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get
between them and the shore, and so might use some stxntugcm with them
in the boat to get them on shore. 'Ve waited a great While, though very
impatient for their removing; and were yer-y uneasy, when, after long cou-
snltation, we saw them all start up, and nun-ch down towards the sea: it
seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place,
that they resolved to go on board the ship gain, give their companions
over for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to he
as it really was, that they had given over their search, and were going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to
sink at the apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a. stratagem to
fetch them back gain, and which answered my end to u tittlc. I ordered
Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little creek westward, towards
the place where the savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and
so soon as they came to a lit-tie rising ground, at about half o mile distance,
I bade them hailoo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the
seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer
them, they should return it again ; and then, keeping out of sight, take a
round, always answering when the others hallooed, to draw them as for into
the island and among the woods as possible, ind then wheel about again
to me by such ways as l directed them.

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed ;
and they presently heard them, and, answering, ran along the shore west-
word, towards. the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the creek,
Where, the water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat
to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When they had set
themselves over, I observer] that the boat being gone a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of the
three men out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat,
having fastened her to the stump of u, little tree on the shore. This was
what I wished for g and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate
to their business, I took the rest with me; and, crossing the creek out of

their sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware--one of them

lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat. The fellow on shore
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up; the captain, who
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down ; and then called
out to him in the bout to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very
few arguments to persuade a. single man to yield, when he saw five men
upon him, and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems. one
of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew,
and therefore was wsily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join
very sincerely with us. In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by
hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to
another, till they not Only heartily tired them, but left them where they
were very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark;
and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came
back to us,

"-"e had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to
fell upon them, so as to make sure work with them. it was several hours
after Friduy came back to me before they came back to their boat ; and we
could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to
those hehind to come along ; and could also hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster:
which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat :
hut it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat .
fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gene. We
could hear them call one to another in a most lamentable manner, telling
one another they were got into an enchanted island ; that either there were
inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils
und spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured. They
hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a great many
times; but no answer. After some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and
sometimes they would go and sit down in the heat to rest themselves : then
come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again
My men would fain have had me give them leave to fell upon them at once-
in the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to
spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was.
unwilling to hazard the. killing of any of our men, knowing the others.

were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to 'see if they did not separate;
245
and therefore, to make sure of them, I dreur my amhuscade nearer, and
ordered Friday and the captain to omop upon their hands and feel, as close
to the ground as they could, that they might- not be discovered. and get as
near them as they could possibly, before they ofi'orod to fire.

They had not been long in let posture, when the hoatmvain, who was
the principal ringleader of tho mutiny, and had now shown himself the
most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came Walking towards them,
with two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this prin-
cipal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let
him come. so near as. to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue
before : but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on
their feet, lei. lly at them. The hoatswain was killed upon the spot: the
next mun was shot. in the body, and full just. by him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it. At the noise of the
fine, I immediately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight
men; viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain
and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom wo had trusted with
arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see
our number; and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now
one of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring thorn to a pariey
and so perhaps might reduce them to terms; which fell out just us we
desired : l'or, indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they
would be very willing to capitulale. So he calls out as loud as he could to
one of them, " Tom Smith! Tom Smithi" Tom Smith answered imme-
diately, " Ts that Robinson?" for it seems he know the voico. The other
answered, "Ay, uy; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and
yield, or you are all dead men this moment." " W'ho must we yield to?
"" here are they?" says Smith again, "'Here they" are," says he; "holds our
captain and fifty men with him, huvo been hunting you these two hours;
the boatswm'n is killed, Will Fry is wounded, and I am a. prisoner; and if
you do not yield, you are all lost." " Will they give us quarter then?"
says Tom Smith, " and we will yield." " I'll go .uud ask, if you promise to
yield," said Robinson: so he asked the captain; and the cuptuin himself
then calls out, "You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but
\\-'ill Atkins."

Upon this, Will Atkins cried ou , "For God's sake, captain, give me

quarter; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I : " which, by
245
the way, was not true; ibr, it seems, this Will Atkins was the first man
that laid hold of the captain, when they first mufinied, and used him
barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious longtime. How-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and
trust to the governor's mercy: by which he meant me, for they all called
me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two more, who
hound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which, with those-
three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, and upon their
boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship:
and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostu--
lated with them upon the villeny of their pr:u::tices with him, and upon the
further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it. must bring them to
misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They all
appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he
told them they were not his prisoners, but the commander's of the island;
that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited
island ; but it had pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and
that the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them all them,

_ if he pleased ; but us he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would
send them to England, to he dealt with there as just-ice required, except
Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for
death, for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired I
efl'eet; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the mpmin to inteioede with the
governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that
they might not he sent to England.

It. now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance wns come, and
that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to he hearty in
getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in'the dark from them, that they
might not see what- kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me; when I called, at a. good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak
again, and soy to the captain, " Captain, the commander calls for you ; " and
presently the captain replied, " 'l'ell his Excellency, I run just coming."
This more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed that the commander
was just by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told

him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and
247
resolved to put it in execution the next morning. But, in order to execute
it with more art, and to he secure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, u-nd two more of the
worst of them, and send them pinioncd to the cave where the others lay.
This was committed to Friday and the two men who came on shore with
the captain. They conveyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was,
indeed, it dismal place, especially to men in their condition. The others I
ordered to my bower, as I culled it, of which I have given a full description:
and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,
considering they were upon their behevioxu'.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a
pa'ley with them ; in a. word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought
they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship. He
talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they were brought
to, and that though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as
to, the present notion, yet that if. they were sent to England, they would all
be hanged in chains; hut. that if the)r would join in so just an attempt as
to recover the ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their
pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a. proposal would he accepted by
men in their condition; they fell, down on their knees to the captain, and
promised, with the deepest imprcoutions, that they would be faithful to him
to the lust drop, and that. they should owe their lives to him, and would
go with him all over the World; that the}; would own him as a father to
them as long as they lived, " Well," says the captain, " 1 must go and tell
the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent
to it." So he brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and
that he verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we might be
very secure, l told him he should go back again and choose out those five,
and tell them, that they might see he did not want men, that he would take
out those live to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep the
other two and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cove), as
hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in
the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the
shore. This Icoked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in
earnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it was
now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade

the other live to do their duty.
'24!)
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : first, the captain,
his more, and passenger: second, the two prisoners of the first gang, to
whom, having their character from the captain, I had given their liberty,
and trusted them with arms: third, the other two that I had l-cht till now
in. my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's motion, had now released:
fourth, these five released at lust; so that they-were twelve in all, besides
five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on
board the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was
proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind ; and it was employment
enough for us to keep then). asunder, and supply them with rictuals. As to
the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Fridsvxr went in twice
a day to them, to supply them with necessaries ; and I made the other two
col-r3r provisions to a. certain distance, where Friday was to take them.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain,
who told them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after
them; and that it was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any--
where but by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into
the castle, and be laid in irons : so that us we never suffered them to see me
as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor,
the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two
boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger
captain of one, with four of the men ; and himself, his mute, and five more,
went in the other; and they contrived their business very well, for they
came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within call of
the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had found
them, and the like ; holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's side;
when the captain and the mute entering first with their arms, immediately
knocked down the second mute and carpenter with the butt-end of their
muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men; they secured all the
rest that were upon the main and quarter--decks, and began to fasten the
hatches, to keep them down that were below; when the other boot and
their men, entering at the forec'huins, secured the forecastlc of the ship,
and the, scuttle which went down into the cook-room, milking three men
they found there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck,
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-

249 K K
house, where the new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had
got up, and with two men and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands;
and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and
his men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a. musket
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed
nobodyi The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house,
wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the

 

m mmn CAPTAIN IS SHUT

head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out- again behind one of
his ems, so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the mat yielded,
and the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the shipwas thus scoured,_the captain ordered seven guns
to he fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of
his success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hem, having sat

watching upon the shore for it till near two o'clock in the morning. Ham
250
thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a day
of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was surprised with the
noise of n. gun; and presently starting up, I heard a men call me by the
name of "Governor I Governor!" and presently I know the captain's voice ;
when. climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to
the ship, he embraced me in his arms, " My dear friend and deliverer,"
says he, " there's your ship ; for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that
belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode, within
little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor
as soon as they were masters of her, and, the Weather being fair, had
brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little creek; and,
the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnacc in near the place
where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at
first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw mvdelivemncc,
indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At- fiist, for some time,
I was not able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his
arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He
perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket
and gave me it dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me,
After I had drunk it, I sat. down upon the ground; and though it brought;
me to myself, yet it was a. good while before I could speak it word to him.
All this time the poor man was in as great, an ecstasy as I, only not under
any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender things to
me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy in
my breast, that it; put all my spirits into confusion : at last it broke out
into tears ; and, in a little While after, I recovered my speech. I then took
my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced togethen I
told him I looked upon him as '3. man sent by Heaven to deliver me, and
that the whole transact-ion seemed to he a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were. the testimonies we had of a secret lumd of Providence
governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of an infinite Power
could search into the remotcst Corner of the world, and send help to the
miserabie whenever He pleased. I. forgot not to lift- up my heart in
thankfulness to Hen. em and what heart could fox-bear to bless Him, who
had not only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a Wilderness,
and in such a. desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed.

When we had talked a. while, the captain mid me ne nad brought me.
some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches
that had been so long his mastexs hind not plundered him oPS Upon this, he
called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that
were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been one
that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I haul been to dwell
upon the island still. Fixst, he had brought me a. case of bottles full of' '
excellent cordial waters, six large; bot-tics of Madeira wine (the bottles held
two quarts each}, two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces
of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a. bag of peas, and about a
hundred--weight. of biscuit; he also l'urought me a box of sugar, a box of

flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime~juice and uliundunoe of
252
othvr things. But besides those, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths,
two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a. hat, and one pair of stockings, with
a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little :
in a word, he clothed me fmm head to foot It was a very kind and
agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances;
but never was anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward,
and uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were
brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to he done
with the prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering whether we might
venture to take them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom he
knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain
said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and
if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malclactors, to be
delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come' to ; and
I found that the captain himself was very :"ixious about it. Upon this, I
told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them upon the
island. " I should he very glad of that," says the captain, " with all my
heart." " Well," says I, " I will send for them up, and talk with them for
you. So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now dis-
charged, their comrades having performed their promise; I say, I caused
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were,
to the bower, and keep them there till I came, After some time, I came
thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be brought
before me, and I told them I had got a full account of their villanous
behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and
were preparing to commit farther robberies, but that Providence had
ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit
which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my direction the
ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see
by--and-by, that their new captain had received the reward of his villany,
and that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm; that, as to them, I
wanted to know what they had to say why I should not execute them as
pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I
had authority so to do.

253
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing
to say but this, that when they were taken, the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not
what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the
island with all my men, and had taken passge with the captain to go for
England; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England, other
than us prisoners in irons, to he tried for mutiny, and running away with
the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know, would he the
gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had
a mind to take their fate in the island. If they desired that, us I had
liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give them their lives.
if they thought they could shift on shore They seemed very thankful for
it, and said they-would much rather venture to stay there than he carried
to England to be hanged. So 1 left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he dmst
not leave them there. Upon this, I seemed a little angry with the captain.
and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; end that seeing I had
offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if
he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I found
them; and if he did not like it, he might take them again if he could catch
them. Upon this, they appeared very thankful, and l accordingly set them
at liberty, and hnde them retire into the woods, to the place whence they
came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some
directions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. Upon this
I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the captain I would stay that
night to prepare my things, and desimd him to go on board in the mean!
time, and keep all @ht in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day
for me; ordering him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was
killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that. these men might see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apert-
ment, and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.
I told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain
had carried them away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them
the new captain hanging at the yard--arm of the ship, and told them they
had nothing less to expect

When they haxl all declared their Willingness to stay, I then told them
I' would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the

way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole history
254
of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a word,
all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the story also of
the seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a letter,
and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves. Here
it may he noted that the captain, who had ink on board, was greatly sur-
prised thni: I never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water, or
of something else. as I haxl done things much more diflicult,

I left them my lire--arms, viz. five muskets, three funding-pieces, and
three swords. Iliad above a barrel and a. half of powder left; for after
the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none, I gave them a
description of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fat-ten them, and to make both butter and cheese, In 9. word, I gave them
every part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-
seeds, which I told them 1 would have been very glad of. Also, I gave
them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat. and bade
them he sure to sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on board the
ship, We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The
next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship's side,
and, making the most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be
taken into the ship for God's sake, for they should be murdered, and begged
the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them immediately.
Upon this, the captain pretended to have 'no power without me; but after
some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they were
taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped and pickled;
after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being
up, with the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my
intercession, caused their chests and clothes tolbe added, which they took,
and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them. by telling them, that
if it lay in my power to send any vemel to take them in, I would not
forget them.

When I took leave of this island, I curried on board, for reliques, the
great gi'mlpskin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also,
I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by

me so long useless that it was grown rust-y or tarnished, and could hardly
255ROBIKSON CR usom

pass for. silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as also the money
I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship And thus T left the island, the
19th of December, as I found by the ship's account, in the your 1686, after
I had been upon it eiglitrand-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days;
being delivered from this second captivity thc sumo day of the month that
I first made my escape in the long-boat from among the Moon: of Sallce.
In this v65361,after a long voyage, I arrived in England the llth of June,
in the your 1687, having been thirty-five yours absent

\l'hen I enme in England, I was an: perfect a. stranger to all the world
as if 1 had never been known them My benefactor and faithful steward,
whom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great mis~
fortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very low
in the world. I made. her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her
I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her
former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would
afford ; which at that time would,,indood, allow me to do but little for her :
but I assured her I would never lhrget her former kindness to me; nor did
I forget her when I had sufficient 1.0 help her, as shall he observed in its
proper place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my flit-her was
dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, except. that I found two
sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers; and as I had been
long ago given over for dead, there had been no provision made for me; so
that, in a. word, I found nothing to relieve or assist mo; and that the little
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one. piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and
this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and
by the same. means saved the ship and cargo, having given a, very handsome
account to the owners of thc manner how I had saved the lives of the men,
and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other merchants con--
cerned, and all together made me a. very handsome compliment upon the
subject, and a present of almost PS200 sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,
and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I resolved
to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some information of the
state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of my-
purtner, who: I had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over
for dead, With this View, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in
April following; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all

256CRUSH "um um um) cArnIN.

these mnhlings, and proving a most. faithful servant upon all occasiona

When I came w Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular

satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship, who fimt took me up at

sea 011' the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left ufl' going

In sea. having put. his son, who was far from a young man, into his ship,
25'! L L
and who still used the Brazil trade The old men did not know me; and
indeed, I hardly knew him. But T soon brought him to my remembrance,
and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who
I was.

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us,
I inquired= you may be sure after my plantation and my partner. The old
man told me he had not been in the Brozils for about. nine years ; but that
he could assure me, that when he came away my partner was living; but
the trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my part,
were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very good
account of the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general
belief of my helm cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the
account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procuretor--fiscsl,
who had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one-third to the
king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for
the. benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic
faith: but that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance,
it would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual production
being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured
me that the steward of the king's revenue from lands, and the provider-e, or
steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along that the incumbent,
that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account of the produce,
of which they had duly received my moiety. I asked him if he knew to
what height of improvement he had brought the plantation, and whether
he thought- it might be worth looking after; or whether, on my going
thither, I should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right
in the moiety. He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the
plantation was improved; but this he knew. that my partner was grown
exceeding- rich upon the enjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of
his remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of my part, which
was, it seems, granted away to some other monaster ' or religious house,
amounted to above two hundred moidores a year: that as to my being
restored to a quiet possession of it. there was no question to be made of
that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also
enrolled in the register of the country; also he told me that the survivors
of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy ; and
he believed I would not only have their assistance for putting me in pos-

session, but would find a very considerable sum of money in their hands
258 -
for my account, being the produce of the farm while their fathers held the
trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he remembered, was
for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and
inquired of the old captain how it come to pass that the trustees should
thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and

' had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &o.

He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being
dead, he could not set- as executor, until some certain account should come
of my death ; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing
so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim;
and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so they call
the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was now at the Bruzils,
orders to do it>> " But," says the old man, "I luvc one piece of new to
tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and
that is, believing you were lost, and all the world believing so also, your
partner and trustees did offer to account with me, in your name, for the
first six or eight years' profits, which I received. There being ct that time
great disbursements for increasing the works, building on ingenio, and
buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it pro-
dueed: however," says the old man, "I shall give you a. true account of
what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it."

After a few days' Further ccmference with this ancient- friend, he brought
me an account of the first six years' income of my plantation, signed by my

. partner and the merchzmt-trustecs, beiug'alwcys delivered in goods, viz.
tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c. which is
the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every
year the income considerably increased; but, as above, the disbmsements
being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old man let. me see
that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold,
besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco. which
were lost in his ship; he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon,
about eleven years after my leaving the place. The good man then began
to complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use
of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a. new ship.
"However, my old friend," says he, " you shall not want a supply in you
necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied."

259
Upon this he pulls out on old pouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty
Portugal moidores in gold ; and giving the writings of his title to the ship,
which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter--part
owner, and his son another, he puts them both into my hands for security
of the rest

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man
to be able to hear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all
occasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I
could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked
him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that
time. and if it would not. struiten him? He told me he could not say but
it might streiten him a, little ; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.

Everything the good man said was full of oll'ootion, and I could hardly
refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the
moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:
then I rotiu-ned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the
plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards
did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would
not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money, I found
he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive
what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a. penny more
from him.

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put: me into a.
method to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought to go
over to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased; but that, if I did
not, there. were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to
appropriate the profits to my use: 'and as there were ships in the river of
Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a.
public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive,
and that .l' was the same person who took up the land for the planting the
said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by u. notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a. letter of his writing,
to a. merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.

Never was anything more honoumhle than the-proceedings upon this
pmcumtion; for in loss than seven months I received o large packet from

260
the survivors of my trust-cos, the merchants, for whose account I went to
sea, in which were the following particular letters and papers incloscd.

First, there was the accountrcurxcnt pf the produce of my farm or
plantation, from the your when their fathers had balanced with my old
Portugal captain, being for six years ; the balance appeared to be one
thousand one hundred and seventy--four moidores in my favour.

Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while theyr kept the
effects in their hands, before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called civil
death; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing,
amounted to ninelxeen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusudocs, being,
about three thousand two hundred and forty moidorcs.

Thirdly, there was the Prior of St Augustine's account, who luul
received the profits for above fourteen years; but not being to account for
what was disposed of by the hospital, vory honestly declared he had eight
hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged
to my account: as to the king'spert, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very all'ectionctcly
upon my being alive, giving mo an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year; with the particulars of the number of squares
or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon
it: and making twoeud-twcnr.)~ crosses for blessings, told me he had said
so many Jl 7:1: Marius to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive ; inviting
me very passionately to come over and take possession of my own ; and, in
the mean time, to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if
I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship,
and that of his family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine lcopurds'
skins. which he had, it seems, received from Afr-ion, by some other ship
that he had sent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage
than 1. He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a. hundred
pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet,
my two rncrclmnt-trustccs shipped me one thousand two hundred chests oi
sugar, eight hundred mlls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole account
in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the letter end of Job was better than
the beginning. It is impossible to express the 'lluttcrings of my very heart
when I formd all my wealth about me ; for us the Brazil ships come all in

fleets, the some ships which brought my letters brought my goods: and

the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand. In a.
word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the old man run and
fetched me a. cordiaL I believe the sudden surprise of joy had oversct
nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that, I continued very ill1
and was so some hours, till a physician being sent. for, and something of
the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered mo to be let blood;
after which I had relief, and grow well: but I verily believe, if I had not
been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died.

I_ was new master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds
sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might. well call it, in the Brazils,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England:
and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to under-

stand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing
262
I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old captain, who
had been first charitable to me in mydistrcss, kind to me in my beginning,
and honest to me at the end. 'I' showed him all that was sent to me; I
told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things,
it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which I
would do a hundred--fold : so I first returned to him the hundred moidores
I had received of him ; then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw
up a general release or discharge from the four hundred and seventy
moirlores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and
firmest manner possible. After which, I caused a proourution to be drawn,
empowering him to be the receiver of the annual profits of my plantation ; '
and appointing my partner to account with him, and make the returns, by
the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a clause in the end, made a'
grant of one hundred moidores a your to him during his life, out of the
effects, and fifty moidores a your to his son after him, for his life: and thus
I required my old man.

I. had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to
do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and
indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my silent state
of life in the island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had
nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now a. great charge upon me,
and my business was how to secure it. 1 had not a cave now to hide my
money in,_or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grow
mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on the
contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it>> My old
patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in tho Brazils seemed to summon me thither;
but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had settled my
all'airs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me, At first I
thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would
be just to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for ought I
knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back
to Englund myself, and take my effects with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and there-
fore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who
had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow,
whose husband had been my first benefactor. and she, while it was in her

power, my faithful steward and instructor. So, the first thing I did, I got
263
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only
to pay a. bill, but to go find her out, .and carry her, in money, a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort. her in her poverty, by
telling her she should, if I lived, have it further supply : at the same ti me,
I sent my two sisters in the country a. hundred pounds each, they being,
though not in wont, yet not in very good circumstances ; one having been
married and left- n widow ; and the other having a husband not so kind to
her as he should he, . But, among all my relations or acquaintances, I could
not yet pitoh upon one to whom I dinst commit the grass of my stock, that
1 might go away to tho Brezils, and leave things safe behind me; and this
greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled myself
the-re, for l was, as it were, naturalized to the place; but I hznl some little
sample in my mind about religion, which inscnsibly drew me hack. How-
ever, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the present ;
and as I had made no aernple of being openly of the religion of the country
all the while I was among them, so neither dill I yet ; only that, now and
then, having of late thought more of it than formerly, when l begun to
think of living and dying among them, I began to regret my having pro-
fessed myself a I'apist, and thought it i'night not be the best religion to
die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going
to the Brnzils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects
behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if I arrived, 1
concluded that I should make some neqnnintance, or find some relations,
that would be faithful to inc; and, accordingly, 1 prepared to go to England
with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil llcet
being just going away) resolved to give nnswers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the Prior of St.
Augustine, I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer
of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidorcs which were undisposed of,
which I desired might be given, five hundred to the monastery, and three
hundred dud seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct; desiring
the good padre's prayers for me, and the like I wrote next a letter of
thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much
justice and honesty called for: as for sending them any present, they were

far above having any occasion of it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, oclrnow<
26-:
ledging his industry in the 1mpmving the plantation and his intevr'ity in
increasing the stock of the 1- orks oiving him instructions for his future
government of my part, according to the powers I had left with 111v old
patron to whom I desired him to 111111 whatever become due to me, till he
should hear from me more partieularlv;assu1inn him that it was my intcn-
tion not only to come to him, but to settle my self then: for the remainde1
of my life To this I added a ve1y handsome present of some Ttalian silks
fo1 his wife and two daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he
l1;11.l; with two pieces of fine English bmad cloth, the best- I could get in
Lisbon liV-e pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of 11 good value.

llztvi mg thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all 111v effects
into good hills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go to
England: I had been accustomed enough to the $1311, 11nd yet I had a strange
aversion to go to England in sea at that time; and though I could give no
reason for it, yet the difficult-y increased upon me so much that though I
had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and
that not once, but two or three times.

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of
the reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts
in cases of such 1110111011t:t-\V11 of the ships which I had singled out to go in,
I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having put. my thinos
on board one of them,:1.11d in the othei having agreed with the captain, I
say two of these ships 111iscnr1'icd _; viz. one was taken by the Algerincs,
and the other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and 11.11 the people
diowned, except three; so that in either of those vessels I had been made
miserable.

Il'nving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I
communicated everything, messed me earnestly not to go by sea, but either
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay lio Rochelle,
from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by 1111111 to Paris, and so
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by hmd
through France In a word, I was so prepossessed against. my going by sea
at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by
land; which, 11s I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by
much the pleasanter "my: and to umkc it more so, my old captain brought
an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing
to travel with me ; after which we picked up two more English merchants
also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only ; so

2115 M M
that in all, there were six of us, and five servants ; the two merchants and
the two Portuguese cementing themselves with one servant between two,
to save the charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me
as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be
capable of supplying the place of a servant on the road.

In this Winner 1 set out from Lisbon; and our company being very
'well mounted and armed, we made a little troup, whereof they did me the
honour to call me captain, as well because 1 was the oldest man, as because
I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the. whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my seojournals, so I shall trouble
you now with none of my land journal; but some adventures that hap-
yencd to us in this tedious and diificult journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain, were
willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth
observing ; but, it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away,
and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we came
to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with
an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of the monn~
twins, that several travellers were obliged to come back to l'anipeluna, after
having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.

When we come to I'mnpeluna itself, we found it. so indeed 3 and to me,
that had been always used to a hot climate, and to Countries where I could
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed, was it
more painful than surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old Custilo,
where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and immediately to
feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as
to be intolerable, and to endanger bennmbing and perishiug of our fingers
and toes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all
covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt
before in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pompeluna, it
continued snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people said
winter was come before its time ; and the roads, which were diflicult before,
were now quite impassable ; for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too
thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the
northern countries, there was no going without being in danger of being
buried alive every step. ' We stayed no less than twenty days at: l'nnipelunu;
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better,

266
for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been known in the
memory of man), i proposed that we should go away to Fontemhia, and
there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But,
while I was considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who,
having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as we were on the
Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the country near the head
of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains by such ways that
they were not much incommoded with the snow ; for where they met with
snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to hear them
and their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake
to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were
armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in
these great snows, it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at
the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the ground
being ooveied with snow. \Ve told him we were well enough prepared for
such creatures as they were, if he would insure us fiom ukind of two-legged
wolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger from, especially on the
French side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there was no danger of'
that kind in the way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow
him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French,
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come
back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampelunu with our guide, on the 15th of
November ; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of going forward,
he came directly back with us on the same road that we come from Madrid,
about twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the
country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a. sudden, turning
to his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is
true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours,
such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed
the height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the
snow; and all on a. sudden, he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces
of Languedoc and Gusoony, all green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a
gmt distance, and we had some rough way to pass still.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole
day and a. night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we

should soon be'past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend,
267
~every day, and to come more north than before; and 50, depending upon
our guide, we went on.

it: was about two hours before night, when, our guide being something
before us, and not just in sight, out. rushed three monstrous wolves, and
after them a beer, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood : two of the
wolves made at. the guide, and, had he been far before us, he would have
been devoured before we could have. helped him; one of them fastened
upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence, that he
had not time or presence of mind enough to drew his pistol, but halloocd
and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next me, I bade
him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
.sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, " 0 master! 0
'master ! " but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and with
his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; for, having
'been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but
'went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would have
'fired at a further distance, and have perhapseither missed the wolf, or
en aercd shooting the man

But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I; and, indeed,
'it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we
heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise
redoublod by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been
-a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a. few as
that we had no cause of apprehension : however, as Friday had killed this
wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and
fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his head,
where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man was
most hurt ; for the raging creature had hit him twice, once in the arm, and
the other time a little above his knee; and though he had made some
defence, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his home, when
Friday name up and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol. we all mended
our pace, and rode up us first as the way, which was very difficult, would
give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the
trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and
how Frida)r had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently
discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.

268
But never was a light managed so hardily, and in such a surprising-
manner as that which followed bot-ween Friday and the bear, which gave
us all, though at fust we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest
diversion imaginable. As the bear is a. heavy, clumsy creature, stud does
not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular
qualities, which genemlly are the rule of his actions ; first, as to men, who>>
are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they-

 

vmlur uuxvsns Tim Gums 1'80" Tm: \vonvm.

first attack him, unless he be excessiveiy hungry, which it is probable-
might now be the case, the ground being covered with snow), if you do not
meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but then you must take-
care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is a very nice gon--
tleman ; he will not go a. step out of his way for a. pn'nce ; may, if you are
really afmid, your best way is to look another way and keep going on;

for sometimes if you stop, and stand stiil, and look steadfastly at him, he>>,
2G9
takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, and it
hits him, though it- were but a. bit of stick as big as you finger, he thinks
himself abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge,
and will have satisfaction in point of honour ;--thut is his filst quality:
the next is, if he be once afi'rontcd, he will never leave you, night or day,
till he has his revenge, but. follows at a good round rate till he overtakes
you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him,
he was helping him off his horse, for the mm was both hurt and frightened,
when on a sudden we esPied the bear come out of the wood, and :1 mon-
strous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw, We were all a little
surprised when we saw him ; but when Frizhiy saw him, it was easy to see
joy and courage in the follow's countenance: "O, 0, O !" says Friday,
three times, pointing to him ; " 0 master: you give me to leave, me shaker:
to hand with him; me makee you good long ."

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased : " You fool," says I,
"he will eat>> you up."----" Eatee me up! eat'ee me up E" says Friday, twioe
over again; " me ealee him up: me makee you good laugh ; you all stay
here, me show you good laugh." So down he sits, and gets 01? his boots
in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they
wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his home,
and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking soft-1y on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till
Friday coining pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand
him, " Hark ye, hark-ye," says Friday, "me speakee with you." We fol--
lowed at a. distance, for now being down on the Gasoony side of the moun-
tains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was plain and petty
Open, though it had many trees in it scattered hero and there. Friday, who
had, as we say, the heels of thehear, came up with him quickly, and took
up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but,
did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a, wall; but it
answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it
purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called
it. As soon as the bear felt- the blow, and saw him, he turns about, and
tomes after him, taking very long strides, and shuffling on at a strange
use, so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop: away runs Friday,
and take his course as if he mu towards us for help; so we all resolved to

fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at
270
him heartily for bringing the hear back upon us, when he was going about
his own business another way; and especially I was angry that he had
turned the bear upon us, and then ran away; and I called out, " You dog !:
is this you: making us laugh? Come away, and-take your horse, that. we
may shoot the creature" He heard me, and cried out, "No shoot, no
shoot; stand-still, and you get much laugh :" and as the nimble creature.
ran two feet for the bear's one, he turned on a sudden on one side. of us,
and seeing u. great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow ;_
and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down.
upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree.
The bear soon came to the two, and we followed at a distance: the firsl.

thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelled at it; but let- it lie, and up he.
scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy.
I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for
my life see anything to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode near to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end
of a. large branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the
bear got out to that. part where the limb of the tree was wealccr,---" Ha ! "
says he to us, " now you see me teachee the bear dancez" so he began

jumping and shaking the bough, at which the. bear-bgan to totter, but;
271
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get. back ;
then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him
by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him again.
as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, " What, you come no
further? pray you come farther ;" so he left jumping and shaking the tree ;
and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a little
farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We
thought now was a good time to knock him in the hood, and called to
Friday to stand still, and we should shoot the bear: but he cried out
earnestly. " O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then-7' he would
have said by-uud-by. Howover, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much, and the hour stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but
still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he
depended upon shaking the heat off ; and we found the hear was too
cunning for that too; for he would not go out for enough to be thrown
down, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could
not imagine what>> would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at
last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling
fast to the hough, end that he Would not he persuaded to come any farther,
" Well, well," says Friday, "you no come farther, me go; you no come to
me, me come to you -," and upon this he went out to the smaller end of tho
bough, where it would bond with his weight, and gently let himself down
by it, sliding down the hough till he come near enough to jump down on
his feet, and away he run to his gun, took it up, and stood still. " Well,"
said I to him, "Friday, what will you do now? Why don't you shoot
him?"--"No shoot," says Friday, "110 yet ; me shoot now, me no l<ill ;
me stay, give you one more laugh 2" and, indeed, so he did ; for when the
bear saw his enemy gone, he come back from the bough where he stood,
but. did it very cautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree; then, with the same hinder
end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving
one font at n, .tima, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he
could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him,
clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the
rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and when he saw we were
pleased, lay our looks, he began to laugh very loud. " So we kill bear in
my country," says Friday. " So you kill them 2" says I ; " why, you have
no guns"r---"No," says he, "no gun, but shoot great much long urn-0w."
272
This was a. good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our
guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of
wolves ran much in my head ; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard
on the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, 1' never
heard anything that filled me with so much horror.

These things, and the approach of night, called us ofi', or else, as Friday
would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this
monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near three
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so we left him, and went forward.
on our journey. .

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and
dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard
afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pleased by
hunger, to seek for food, and had done u great dcul of mischief in the
villages, where. they surprised the country people, killed a great many of
their sheep and horses, and some people too. We had one dangerous place
to pass, and our guide told us, if there were more wolves in the country we
should find them there ; and this was a small plain surrounded with woods
on every side, and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to
get through the wood, and then we should come to the villge where we
were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the
wood, and a. little after sunset when we came into the plain: we met with
nothing in the first wood, except that in a. little plain within the wood,
which was not above two furlonga over, we sew five great wolves cross the
road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some
prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were gone (ML of
sight in a, few moments. Upon this, our guide, who by the way was but
a faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there
were more wolves a--coming. We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about
us ; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was
near half a. league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into the
plain, we had occasion enough to look about us: the first object we met
wild] was a. dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had
killed, and at least a. dozen of them at Work, we could not say eating him.
but picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.
'We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did they take
much notice of us. Friday would have let. fly at them, but I would not

sulfur him by any means; for I found we were like to have more business
273 N N
upon our hands than we were aware of. We had not gone half over the
plain, when we began to hour the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a
frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly
as an army drawn up by experienced officers. 1 scarce knew in what
manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a. close line was
the only Way ; so we formed in a. moment; but that we might not have too
much interval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that
_ the others, who had not. fired, should stand. ready to give them a second
volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that
those who had fired at first, should not pretend to load their l'usees again,
but stand ready, every one with a. pistol, for we were all armed with a, fusee
and a pair of pistols each man; so we. were, by this method, able to fire six
volleys, hall" of us at 9. time: however, at present we had no necessity;
for upon. firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified
as well with the noise as with the fire. Four of them being shot in the
head, dropped ; seventl others were wounded, and went bleeding 03', as we-
could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not immediately
retreat; whereupon, remembering that I had been told that the fiercest
creatures were terrified at the voice of a mun1 I caused all the company to
hullno as loud as they could ; and I found the notion not altogether mis-
taken; for upon our shout they began to retire and turn about I then
ordered a second volley to he fired in their rcnr, which put them to the
gallop, and away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge
our pieces again ; and that we might lose no time, we kept. going ; but we
had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness,
when we heard a terrible noise in the sumo wood on our left, only that it
was further onward, the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which nmde
it worse on our side; but the noisc increasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and, on a
sudden, we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind
us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them:
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, us
fast as We could me'kc our horses go, which, the way being very rough,
was only a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view of the
entrance of 9. wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther side

of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the
274
lane or pass, we saw a. confused number of wolves standing just at the
entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the
noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and
o. bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after
him full speed : the horse had the advantage or them ; but as we supposed
that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up
with him at last : no question but they did.

But here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the entruncn
where the horse came out, we found the earcases of another horse and of
two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no
doubt the same whom we heard tire the gun. for there lay a gun Just by

aim!

him fired oil"; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body
were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course
to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us
presently, in hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there were three hundred
of them. It happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entranee
into the wood, but a. little way from it, there lay some large timber-trees,
which had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for
carriage. l drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing our-
selves in u. line behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and
keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three

fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre We did so, and it was well we
275
did ; f0r never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us
' in this place. They come on with a growling kind of noise, and mounted
the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were
only making upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was prin-
cipally oceasioned by their seeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men
to fire as before, every other man; and they took their aim so sure that
they killed several of the. wolves at the first volley; but there was a
necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils, those
behind pushing on those before. _

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, We thought they
stopped a little, and I hoped they Would have gone off, but it was but a
moment, for others come. forward again; so we fired two volleys of our
pistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or
eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I
was loath to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my
man Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he had charged my fuscc and his own while We were engaged,
--but, as I said, I culled my other man, and giviw him a horn of powder.
1 bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it he a large
train. He did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves
came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol
close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the timber were
scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among
us with the force and fright of the fire: we desputehed these in an instant,
and the rest were so frightened with the light, which the night--for it was
now very near darkrmade more terrible, that they drew back a little;
upon which I ordered our last pistols to he fired oil in one volley, and after
that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sullied
immediately upon near twenty lznne ones that we found struggling on the
ground, and fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our
expectation, for the crying and howling they made was better understood
by their fellows ; so that they all fled and left us

We had, first and last, killed about threesome of them, and had it been
daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus
cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a. league to go. We
heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we Went several
times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow

dazzling our eyes, we were not ccrtuin.' In about an hour more we came
218rue mum-r \VH'H rm: "mum.

to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright
and all in arms,- for, it seems, the night before, the wolves and some beers
had broke into the village, and put them in such terrorfthat they were
obliged Lo keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve
their cattle, and indeed their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much
with the ranhliug of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we
were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found
u warm climate, :2 fruit-fill, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, not
anything like them ; but when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us
it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at. the foot 01' the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground ; but they inquired
much. what kind of guide we had got, who would venture to bring us that
way in such a. severe season, and told us it. was surprising we were not all
devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in
the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but
we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the
wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really
afraid of a gum--431113 being excessively hungry, and raging on that account,

the eagerness to come at the horses had made. them senseless of dauger,---
77
and that if we had not by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem
of the train of powder, mustered them, it had been greet odds but that we
had been torn to pieces ; Whereas, had we been content to have sat still on
horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so
much for their own, when men were on their books, as otherwise; and,
withal, they told us that at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our
horses, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we
might have come off safe, especially having our firearms in our hands,
being so many in number. For my part, I was never so sensible of danger
in my lite--for, seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and
open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat. to,
I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall never cure to
cross those mountains again; I think I would much rather go a thousand
leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a, week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through
France, ~nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with
much more advantage than I can I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and
without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the
14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time
all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which I
brought with me having been very currently paid.

My principal guide and privy--counsellor was my good ancient widow,
who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much
nor care too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with
everything, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my clients ; and,
indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the
unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brnzils,
I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who having offered it to the two mor--
chants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted

{the oti'er, and remitted thirty-three thousand piecewf--eight to a correspon-
Alent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent

- from Lisbon. and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange

for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces-of--eight for the estate, reserving

the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him (the old men) during

, hislife, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I had

21"
promised them, and which the' plantation was to make good as a rent-charge.
And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure;--
a life of Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will.
seldom be able to show the like of ;--heginning foolishly, but closing mac]!
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hepc for.

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune, I
was past running any more. hazards--4nd so, indeed, I had been, if other
circumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a. wandering life, had
no family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted fresh
acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could
not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon
the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong inclination I had
to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards were in being there.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far pre-
vuilcd with me, that for almost seven years she prevented my running
abroad, during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of
my brothers, into my care ; the eldest, having something of his own, I bred
up as a gentlenmn, and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate
after my deeease The other I placed with the captain of a ship; and after
five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young follow, I put him
into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow afierwards
drew me in, as old as I was, to further adventures myself.

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here ; for, first of all, I married,
and that not either to my disudvanWe or dissatisfaction, and had three
children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and my nephew
coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to-
go abroad, and his importtmity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship
as a private trader to the East Indies; this was in the year 169%.

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island,-saw my succes-
sors the Spaniards,--had the whole story of their lives, and of the villains
I left there--how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards--how they alter-
wards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards
were obliged to use violence with them--how they were subjected to the
Spaniards--how honestly the Spaniards used them ,- a history, if it Were
entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part----
particularly, also, as to their battles with the Coribheans, who landed several
times upon the island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island

itselfi--and how five of them made an attempt upon the mainland, and
279 -ROBINSON Cause h'.

brought away eleven men and five women' prisoners, by which, at my
coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.
. Here I stayed about twenty days--left them supplies of all necessary
things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two
workmen, which I had brought from England with me,---viz. a carpenter
and a smith. .

- Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to myselx
the property of the whole, but gave them such ports respectively as they
agreed on ; and having settled all things with them, and engged them not
to leave the place, I left them there.

From thence I touched at the Brnzils, from whence I sent a bark, which
I bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides other
supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for service, or
for wives to such as Would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised
to send them some women from England, with a. good cargo of neces-
saries, if they would apply themselves to planting,----which I afterwards
could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and diligent after they
were mustered, and had their properties set apart for them I sent them,
also, from the Brnzils, five cows, three of them being big with calf, some
sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again were considerably increased.

But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came
and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with
that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed;
but, at last, a storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they i'amished or
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of
their plantation, and still lived upon the island

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new
adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give u. farther account
of in the Second Part- of my Story.

280
 

THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasions in England, viz. "That
what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh," was never more
verified than in the story of my Life. Any one would think that after
thirty-five years' affliction, and u variety of unhappy circumstances, which
few men, if any, ever went through before, and after near seven yams of
pet-10c and enjoyment in the fulnens of all things; grown old, and when, if
ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience of every state of
middle life, and to know which was most adapted to make a. man com
pletely happy; I say, after all this, any one would have thought that. the
native propensity to rmnbling, which I gave an account of in my first
setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts.
should be worn out, and I m'ght, at sixty-one years of age, have been a
little inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing life and fortune
any more.

Nay. fart-her, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away
in me, for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek: if I had
gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had already enf-
ficicnt for me, and for those I had to leave it to ; and what I had was
visibly incmxsing ; for, having no great fainily, I could not spend the income
of what I had, unless I would set up for on expensive way of living, such
as a great family, servants, equipage, gaicty, and the like, which were things
I had no notion of, or inclination to ; so that I had nothing, indeed, to do
but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily
upon my hands. Yet all those things had no effect upon me, or at least not
enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung
about me like a chronical distemper. In particular, the desire of seeing
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left there, ran in my
head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran upon

it all day: it was uppermost in all my thoughts; and my fancy worked so
281 o o
steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short,
nothing could remove it out of my mind: it even broke so violently into
all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome, for I could talk of
nothing else; all my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence: and I saw
it myself.

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the stir that
people make in the world about ghosts and appmitions is owing to the
strength of imagination, and the powelful opemtion of fancy in their minds;
that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, 01 a ghost walking; that
people's poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased
friends, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying, upon some
extraordinary cheumstances, that they see them, talk to them, and are
answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour
in the thing and they really know nothing of the matter

For my part, I know not to this hour whether them one any such things
as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people after they are dead; or
whether time is anything' in the stories they tell us of that kind more than
the product of vapours, sick minds, and wandering fancies: but this I
know, that my imagination Worked up to such a height, and brought me
into such excess of vapours, or what- else I may call it, that 1 actually sup-
posed myself often upon the spot, at my" old castle, behind the trees; saw
my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors I left upon the
island -, nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked at them steadily, though
I \vaS'hroad awake, as at persons just befOre me; and this I did till I often
frightened myself with the images my fancy represented to me. One time,
in my sleep, I had the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively related to
me by the first Spaniard and Friday's father, that it 'was surprising: they
told me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and
that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress
and starve them 3 things that I had never heard of, and that, indeed, were
never all of them true in fact : but it was so warm in my imagination, and so
realized to me, that, to the hour 1 saw them, 1 could not be persuaded but
that it was or would be true: also how I resented it, when the Spaniard
complained to me; and how 1 brought them to justice, tried them, and
ordered them all three to be hanged. What there was really in this shall
be seen in its place: for however I came to form such things in my dream,
and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, much

of it true. I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and specifically
282unuwws Wm: WILL 30': BI A Hunk/mas r0 mu.

true; but the general part was so true,--thc base, villauous behaviour of
these. three hardened rogues was such, and had been so much worse than
all I can describe, that the dream had too much similitude of the fact ; and
as I would afterwards have punished them severely, so, if I had hanged
them all, I had been much in the right, and even should have been justified
both by the laws of God and man.

But to return to my story: Tn this kind of temper I lived some
years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant; hours, no agreeable
diversion, but what had something or other of this in it ; so that my wife,

who saw my mum wholly bent, upon it, told me very seriously one night,
283
that she believed there was some secret, powerful impulse of Providence
upon me, which had determined me in go thither again ; and that she found
nothing hindered my going, but my being engaged to a wife and children.
She told me that it was true she could not think of parting with me: but
as she was assured that it" she was-dead it would he the first thing I would
do ; so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would
not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought (it and resolved to go
[Here she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very
earnestly at. her, so that it a little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked
her why she did not go on, and say out what she was going to say? But I
perceived that her heart was too full, and some tours stood in her eyes]
" Speak out, my dear," said I; "are you willing I should go?"---"No,"
says she, very afi'ectionately, " I am far from willing; but if you are resolved
to go," says she, " rather than I would be the only hindrance, I will go with
you: for though I think it a most preposterous thing for one of your years,
and in your condition, yet, if it must be," said she, again weefiing, " I would
not leave you ; for, if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting
it; and if Heaven make it your duty to go, He will also make it mine to go
with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstmct it.

This afi'ectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little out of the '
vapours, and I began to consider what I was doi%; I corrected my wan-
dering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately what business I
had after threescore years, and after such a life of tedious sufi'erings and
disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a mammary--I say, what business
had I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures lit only for
youth and poverty to run into 1

With those thoughts I considered my new engagement: that I had a
wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of another; that I had
all the world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain ; that I
was declining in years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained
than of seeking to increase it; that as to What my wife had said of its
being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, T had
no notion of that; so, after many of these oogitations, I struggled with the
power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people
may always do in like cases if they will. In a word, I conquered it; ; com-
posed myself with such arginnents as occurred to my thoughts, and which
my present condition furnished me plentifully with; and purlieularly, as

the most eil'eetual method, I resolved to divert myself with other things.
'23;(muse! ls luscoxmun NB ms mrfls DRAW.

and to engage in some business that might effectually tie me up from any
more excursions of this kind ; for I found that thing return upon me chiefly
when I was idle, and had nothing to do, nor anything of moment im-
mediately before me. To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of
Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient
house upon it, and the land about it, I found, was capable of great im-
provement ; and it was man;r ways suited to my inclination, which de-
lighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land; and
particularly, being an inland country, I was removed from conversing among
sailors and things mlating to the remote parts of the world. I went down
to my form, settled my family, bought ploughs, harrows, a cart, Waggon-
horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became in one half-
285
year a mere country gentleman My thoughts were entirely taken up in
managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, &c. ; and
I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature was capable of
directing, Or that a. been always bred to misfortunes was capable of retreat-
ing to. '

I farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent to pay, was limited by no
articles ; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what I planted was for
myself, and what I improved was for my family ; and having thus left ofl'
the thoughts of wandering, 1 had not the least discomfort in any purl: of
life as to this world. New I thought indeed that I enjoyed the middle state
of life which my father so earnestly "recommended tome, and lived a kind
of heavenly life, something like what is described bv the poet, noon the
subject of a country life :--

"Free from vices flee from cars,
Age has noopain, and youth no snare."

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Providence
unhinged me {it once; and not only made a. breach upon me inevitable and
incurable, but drove 'me, .by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the
wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being born in nry very blood,
soon recovered its hold of - me ; and, like the returns of a violent distemper,
come on with an irresistible force upon me. This blow was the loss of my
wife. It is not my businesshere to write on elegy upon my wife, give u
character of her particular virtues, and make my court to the sex by the
flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my
affairs; the centre of all my enterprises; the engine that, by her prudence,
reduced me to that happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant and
ruinous project that filled my head, and did more to guide my rambling
genius than a mother's tours, a. father's instructions, a friend's counsel,
or all my own reasoning powers could do. 1 was happy in listening to her,
and in being moved by her errtrezrties ; and to the last degree desolate and
dislocated in the world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. I was as
much a stronger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Bmzils, when I first
went on shore there; and as much alone, except for the assistance of scr-
vants, as I was in my island. I knew neither what to think nor What to
do. I saw the world busy around me : one part labouring for bread, another
part squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures, but equally miserable

because the end they proposed still fled from them ; for the men of pleasure
286
every day surfcited of' their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and
repentance; and the men of labour Spent their strength in. daily struggling
for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured with: so living in a
daily circulation of sormw, living but to work, and working but to live, as
if daily bread'were the only end of wearisome life, and a wanrisome life the
only Occasion of dnily bread; '

This put me in mind of the life. I lived in my kingdom, the island;
where I suffered no more com to grow, because I did not want it; and bred
no more goats, because I had no more use for them; where the money lay_

in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had some the favour to be looked
upon in twenty years. All these things, had I improved them as I ought
to have done, and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have
taught me to Search farther than human errjomexrts for a full felicity ; and
that there was something which certainly was the reason and end of life,
superior to all these things, and which was either to he possessed, or at

least limped for, on this side of the grave.
is:
But my sage counsellor was gone; 1 was like a. ship without upilot'
that could only run store the wind. My thoughts ran all away again into
the old afi'uir ; my head was quite turned with the whimseys of foreign
adventures; and 'all the pleasant innocent amusements of my form, my
garden, my cattle, and my family, which before entirely possessed me, were
nothing to me, bail no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or
food to one that has no taste. In a word, I resolved to leave oll' house-
keeping, let my form, and return to London; and in a. few months alter
.1 did so.

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I had
no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to saunter
about like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in
God's creation, and it is not one farthing's matter to the rest of his kind
whether he be dead or alive. This also was the thing which, of all circum--
stances of life, was the most my aversion, who had been all my days used
to on active life; and I would often say to myself, " A state of idleness is
the very drags of life ;" and, indeed, I thought I was much more suitably
employed when I was twenty-six days making a deal board.

It was nonr the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom, us
I have observed before, I had brought- np to the sea, and had made him
commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Billion, being
the first he had made. He came to me, and told me that some merchants
of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to
the East Indies, and to China, as private. tradem. " And now, uncle," says
be, "if you will go to see. with me, I will engge to lend you upon your
old habitation in the island ; for We are to touch at the Brazils."

Nothing can be a. greater demonstration of a future state, and of the
existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second causes with
the ideas of' things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not
communicated to any in the world.

My nephew know nothing how for my distemper of wandering was
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thought to
say, when that very morning, before he came to me, I had, in a great deal
of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circumstances in
my mind, 001110 to this resolution, that I Would go to Lisbon, and consult
with my old sea-captain; and if it was rational and practicable, I would go
and see the island again, and what was become of my people there. I had

inhabitants from hence, getting a patent for the possession, and I know not
What ; when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have
said, with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the East Indies
I paused awhile at his Words, and looking steadily at him, "What
devi ," said I, " sent you on this unlucky errand?" My nephew stared as
if he had been frightened at first ; but perceiving that I was not much dis--
pleased with the propoml, he recovered himself. "I hope it may not he
an unlucky proposal, sir," says he, " I dare say you would be pleased to see
your'new colony there, where you once reigned with more felicity than
most of your brother monarchs in the World" In a word, the scheme hit
so exactly with my temper, that is to say, the propossession I was under,

and of which I have said so much, that I told him, in a few words. if he

awed with the merchants, I would go with him ; but I told him I \vouiu
not promise. to go any further than my own islund. "Why, air," says be, "you
don"t want to be left there again, I hope i " " But," said I, " can you not
take me. up again on your return?" He told me it would not be possible
to do so ; that the merchants would never allow him to come that way with
a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, and
might be three or four. " Besides, sir, if I should miscerry," said he, " and
not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the condition you
were in before."

This was very rational ; but we both found out a remedy for it; which
was, to carry a. framed sloop on board the ship, which being taken in pieces,
might, by the help of some curpenters,_whom we agreed to carry with us,
be set up again in the island, and finished fit to go to see. in a few days. 1
was not long resolving ; for, indeed, the importunities of- my nephew joined
so effectually with my inclination, that nothing could oppose Inc; on the
other hand, my wife being dead, nOne concerned themselves so much for me
as to persuade me to one way or the other, except my ancient good friend
the widow, who earnestly stmggled with me to consider my years, my easy
circumstances, and the. needless hazards of a long voyage; and above. all,
my young children. But it was all to no purpose: 1 had an irresistible
desire for the voyage; and I told her I thought there was something so
uncommon in the impressions I had upon my mind, that it would he a kind
of resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at. home; after which
she ceased her expostulotions, and joined with me, not only in making
provision for my voyage, but also in settling my famil)r affairs for my
absence, and providing for the education of my children. In order to do
this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had in such a manner for my
children, and placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied
they would have justice done them, whatever might. befall me; and for
their education, T left it wholly to the Widow, with a sufficient maintenance
to herself for her care : all which she richly deserved; for no mother could
have taken more care in their education, or understood it better: and as she
lived till I come home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 1694-5 ;
and T, with my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, the 8th ; having,
besides that sloop which I mentioned almve, a very considerable cargo of
all kinds of necessary things for my colony; which, if I did not find in

good condition, I resolved to leave so,
290
First, I carried with me some servants Whom I purposed to place there
as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my account, while I
stayed, and either to leave them there or carry them forward, as they should
appear willing: particularly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very
handy, ingenious fellow, who was 8 Cooper by trade, and was also a general
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and haanmills to grind
corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker ; he also made anything that
was proper to make of earth or of wood: in a word, We called him our
Jack-ollall-tmdes. With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himsull'
to go a passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards
consented to stay on our new plantation, and who proved a most necessary
handy fellow as could he desired, in many other businesses besides that
of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all
employments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for 1 have not kept account of the
particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and some English
thin stull's, for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there; and
enough of them, as by my calculation, might comfortably supply them for
seven years: if I remember right, the materials I carried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could want
for wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds, including some beds,
bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with pots,
kettles, pewter, brass, &c. ; and near a. hundred pounds more in iron-work,
nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing
I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees; besides some
pistols, a. considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of
lead, and two pieces of brass cannon; and, because I knew not what time
and what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of
powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and
halborts. In short, we had a large mgazine of all sorts of stores; and I
made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted
for his ship, to leave behind if there was occasion; so that when we came
there, we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies.
Indeed, I at first thought there would he need enough for all, and much
more, if we hOpcd to maintain our possession of the island; as shall be
seen in the course of that story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet
291
with; and, therefore, shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader,
who, perhaps, may he impatient to hear how matters went with my colony:
yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad weather, happened on this
first setting out, which made the voyage longer than I expected it at first;
and I, who had never made but one voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in
which 1 might be said to come back again, as the voyage was at first
designed, began to think the same ill fate attended me ; and that. I was
born to he never contented with being on shore, and yet to he always
unfortunate at sea. Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we
were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound
two-and-twenty days: but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that
provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that
while we lay here, we never touched the ship's stores, but rather added to
them. Here, also, I took in several live hogs, and two cows with their
calves, which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my
island ; but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very fair
gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about the 20th of
February in the evening late, when the mate, having the watch, came into
the round--house, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and hemd a gun fired;
and while he was telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boutswaiu
heard another. This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for
a while we heard nothing ; but in a few minutes we saw a very great light,
and found that there was some very terrible fire at a distance ; immediately
we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed that there could
be no land that way in which the fire showed itself, no, not for five hundred
leagues, for it- appeared at W.N.W'. Upon this, we concluded it must be
some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our hearing the noise of guns just
before, we concluded that it could not be far ofi', we stood directly towards
it, and were presently satisfied we should discover it, because the further we
sailed, the greater the light appeared; though the weather being hazy, we
could not perceive anything but the light fora while. In about half an
hour's sailing. the wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and the
weather clearing up a. little, we could plainly discern that it was a. great
ship on fire in the middle of the son.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the persons engaged in it: I presently recollected my

former circumstances, and what condition I was in when taken up by the
292
Portuguese captain; and how much more deplorable the circumstances of
the poor creatures belonging to that ship must be, if they had no other ship
in company with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that five guns
should be fired, one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give
nota'ee to them that there was help for them at hand, and that they might
endeavour to save themselves in their boat ; for though we could see the
flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship drove,
waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and in a few minutes all
the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship sunkr This was a
terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who,
I concluded; must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost
distress in their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which, at present, as it
was dark, I could not see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I
caused lights to be hung out in all the ports of the ship where we could,
and which we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night long:
letting them know by this that there was a ship not far ofl'.

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's hosts by
the help of our perspective glasses, and found there were two of them, both
thronged with people, and deep in the water. We perceived they rowed,
the wind being against them ; that they saw our shi , and did their utmost
to make us see them. We immediately spread our ancient, to let them
know we saw them, and hung a wait out, as 9. signal for them to come on
board, and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In little more
than half an hour, we come up with'them ; and, took them all in, being no
less than sixty-four men, women, and children ; for there were a greatmauy
passengers. \

Upon inquiry, we found it was a French merchant ship of three hundred
tons, home-bound from Quebec. The master gave us a. long account of the
distress of his ship : how the fire began in the steerage, by the negligence
of the steersman; which, on his crying out for help, was, as everybody
thought, entirely put out; but they soon found that some sparks of the first
fire had got into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they
could not cfi'eetuully quench it; and afterwards getting in between the
timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and
mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to exert

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which, to their
293
great comfort, were pretty large ; being their long-boat, and a great shallop,
besides a small skiff, which was of no great servioe to them, other than to
get some fresh water and provisions into her, after they had secured their
lives from the fire. They had, indeed, small hopes of their lives by getting into
these boats at that distance from any land ; only, as they said, that they
thus escaped from the fire, and them was a possibility that some ship might
happen to he at sea, and might- take them in. They had soils, care, and a
compass; and had us much provision and water (is, with sparing it so as to
be next door to starving, might support them about twelve days, in which,
if they had no bad Weather and no contrary winds, the captain said he
hoped he might- got to the Banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps
take some fish, to sustain them till they might go on shore. But there were
so many chances against them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset
and founder them ; rains and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs ;
contrary winds, to keep them out and starve them ; that it must have been
next to mimeulous if they had eseaped.

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and ready
to despair, the captain, \idth tears in his eyes, told me they were on a sudden
surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four more: these
were the live guns which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This
revived their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, I desired it
should, that there was a ship at hand for their help. It was upon the
henring of these guns that they tool; down their masts and sails : the sound
coming from the windward, they resolved to lie by till morning. Some
time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired three mnskets, one a. con-
siderable while after another; but these, the wind being contrary, we never
heard. Some time after that again, they were. still more agreeably surprised
with seeing our Lights, and hearing tho, guns which, as I have said, I caused
to be fired all the rest of the night. This set them to work with their oars,
to keep their boats ahead, at least, that we might the sooner come up with
them ; and, at last, to their inexpressiblc joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange
ecstusies, the variety of postures, which those poor delivered people ran
into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance. Grief
and fear are easily described : sighs, torus, groans, and a very few motions
of the head and hands, make up the sum of its variety; but. an excess of
joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it. There were some

in tears ; some raging and-tearing themselves, as if they had been in the
2941m; (mm-v 15 HAWD mx 7!": numa Sm.

greatest agonies of sormw ; some stark raving and downright lunatic ; some
mn about the ship stmnping with their feet, othels wringing theirhands ; some
were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more curing, many quite dumb,
not able to speak a. word ; others sick and vomiting ; several swonning and
ready to faint; ; and a few were crossing themselves and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them either ; there might be many that were thank-
9.95
ful afterwards; but the passion was too strong for them at first, and they
were not able to master it : they were thrown into ecstxwies, and a kind of
frenzy, and it was but a very few that were composed and serious in their
joy. Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the particular
circumstance of that nation they belonged to: I mean the French, whose
temper is allowed to he more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly,
and their spirits more fluid than in other nations. I am not philosopher
enough to determine the cause; but nothing I had ever seen'before came up
to it: The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found
his father in the boat, came the nearest to it ; and the surprise of the master
and his two companions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them
on shore in the island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was to
compare to this, either that I saw in hiday, or anywhere else in my life.

It is further observable, that these extravaganoes did not show themselves
in that dili'erent manner I have mentioned, in different persons only; but
all the variety Would appear, in a' short succession of moments, in one and
the same person. A man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it
were, stupid and confounded, would the next minute be dancing and halloo-
ing like an antic; and the-next moment he tearing his hair, or pulling his
clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a madman; in a
few moments after that we would have him all in tears, then sick, swooning,
and, had not immediate help been had, he would in a few moments have
been dead. Thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with
the greatest part of them ; and, if I remember right, our surgeon was
obliged to let blood of about thirty persons.

There were tw0 priests among them : one an old man, and the other a
young man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the
Worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself safe,
he dropped down stone dead to all appearance. Not the least sign of life
could be perceived in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies
to recover him, and was the only man in the ship that believed he was not
dead. At length he opened a vein in his arm, having first ehafed and
rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possible. Upon this, the
blood, which only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the
man opened his eyes; a quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew better,
and after the blood was stopped, he walked about, told as he was perfectly
well, and took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him. About a

quarter of an hour after this, they came running into the cabin to the
296
surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman that had fainted, and told him
the priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the
change of his circumstances in his mind, and again this put him into an
ecstasy of joy. His spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could
convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish ; and the man was as fit for
Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it. The surgeon would not bleed
him again in that condition, but gave him something to doze and put him
to sleep; which, alter some time, operated upon him, and he awoke next
morning perfectly composed and well. The younger priest behaved with
great command of his passions, and was really an example of a serious,
well-governed mind. At his first coming on board the ship, he threw him-
self flat on his face, prostrating himself in thankful nose for his deliverance,
in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he
had been in a swoon; but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he Was
giving God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave him a few
moments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also. I
was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left him, but kept
others from interrupting him also. He. continued in that posture about
three minutes, or little more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had
said he would, and, with a great deal of seriousnesa and afl'eetion, but with
tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him and so many
miserable creatures their lives. I told him I had no need to tell him to
thank God for it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had done that
already; but I added that it was nothing but what reason and humanity
dictated to all men, and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to
God, who had blesaed us so far as to make us the instruments of his mercy
to so many of his creatures After this, the young priest applied himself
to his countrymen, and laboured to compose them : he persuaded, entrcutod,
argued, reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the
exercise of their reason; and with some he had success, though others were
for a time out of all government of themselves.

T cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be useful to
those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding themselves in the extrava-
ganees of their passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such
a length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not the extravagances
of anger, rage. and a provoked mind, carry us to? And, indeed, here 1 saw
reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as
well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sorrow and anger.

297 QQ
We were somewhat disordered by those extravagances among our new
guests, for the first day ; but after they had retired to lodgings provided for
them as well as our ship would allow, and had slept heartily--as most of
them did, being fatigued and frightened--they were quite another sort of
people the next day Nothing of good manners, or civil noknmrlndgments
for the kindness shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain and one of the
priests came to me the next day, and desired to speak with me and my
nephew; the commander began to consult with us what should he done
with them; and, first, they told us we had saved their lives, so all they had
was little enough for a. return to us for that kindness received The captain
said they had saved some money and some things of value in their boats,
caught hast-i1),r out of the flames, and if we would accept it, they were
ordered to make an offer of it all to us ; they only desired to he set on shore
somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might got a. passage to
France. My nephew wished to accept their money at first. word, and to
consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled him in that.
part, for I knew what- it was to he set on shore in a strange cmmtry ; and
if the Portuguese. captain that took me up at son had served me so, and
taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as
much a sl: ve at the Brazils as I had been at I'nrlnu'y, the mere being sold
to a Mahometan excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much better
master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, much worse.

' I therefore told the French captain that we. had taken them up in their
distress. it was true. but that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow.
creatures ; and we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the. like or
any other extremity; that we had done nothing for them but what we
believed they would have done for us, if we had been in their case, and
they in ours; but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them ;
and it would he a most barbarous thing to take that little from them which
they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore and leave them;
that this would be first to save them from death, and then kill them our-
selves; saw,- them from drowning, and abandon them to starving; and,
therefore, I would not let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting
them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difficulty to us,
for that the shi p was bound to the East Indies ; and though we were driven
out of our course to the wees-Ward a very great way, and perhaps were

directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible
29.3
for us wilfully to change our voyage on their particular account; nor could
my nephew, the captain, answer it to the freightem, with whom he was under
charter to pursue. his voyage by way of Brazil ; and all I knew we could do
for them was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships
homoward bound from the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible,
to England or Frunec.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could not
but be very thankful for it; hut they were in very great consternation,
especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East
Indies; they then entronted me, that as T. was driven so far to the westward
hufore I met with them, I would, at least, keep on the same course to the
Banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some
ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada.

I thought this was but a. reasonable request on their part, and therefore
I inclined to agree to it; for, indeed, I considered that to carry this whole
company to the Test Indies, would not only be an intolerable severity upon
the poor people, but would be mining our whole voyage, by devouring all
our provisions; so T thought it no breech of charter-potty, but what an
unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one
could say we were to blame; for the laws of God and nature would have
forbid that. we should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a.
distressed condition; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting our--
selves us the poor people, obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or
other for their deliverance So I consented that we would carry them to
Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; and if not, that I would
carry thcm to Mm-tinico, in the W'est Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and
as the winds had continued in the points between NE. and SE a long
time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for
we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from
St. Christopher's, but they had been so long heating up against the wind
that they durst take in no passengers, for four of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in ; so we. were
obliged to go on. It was about a week alter this that we mode the Banks
of Newfoundland; where, to shorten mystery, we put all our French people
on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and
afterwards to carry them to Rance, if they could get provisions to victuu]

themselves with. When I say all the French Went on shore, I should
299
remember, that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were hound to the
East Indies. desired to go the. voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the
coast of Coromandcl; which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked
the man, and had vex}r good reason, as will appear afterwards; also four of
the seamen entered themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows,

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away
3 and 'S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind
at .111 , when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon,
almost as deplorable as that before

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the 19th day of
March, 1694-6, when we spied a sail, our course SE. and by S. We soon
perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could not at
first know what to make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found
she had lost her mointopmast, foremost, and bowsprit; and presently she
fired a gun as a signal of distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at
KNW. a. fresh gale, and we soon come to speak with her. We found her
a ship of Bristol, bound home from Burbadoes, but had been blown out of
the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, by a
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mute were both gone on
shore -, so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an indifl'erent
case for good mariners to bring the ship home They had been already nine
weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible stern), after the hurricane
was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the west--
ward, and in which they lost their masts. They told us they expected to-
have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the
south--east, by a stmng gale of wind at N.l\'.\-V., the some that blew now :
and having no sails to work the ship with but 9. main course, and a kind of
square sail. upon a jury foremost, which they had set up, they could not
lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stood away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost stowed for
want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone: their bread
and flesh were quite. gone--they had not one ounce left in the ship, and had
had none for eleven days. The only relief they had was, their water was
not all spent, and they had about half 2r barrel of llour left; they had sugar
enough 5 some succades, or sweetnieats, they had at first, but these Were all
devoured 3. and they had seven cashs of rum. There was a youth, and his
mother, and a maid-servant on board, who were passengers, and thinking

the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the
son
hurricane began; and having no provisions of their own left, they were. in
a more deplorable condition than the rest 2 for the seamen, being reduced to
such an extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure,
for the poor pamengers; and they were, indeed, in such a. condition that
their misery is very hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me
(the weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go on board the ship. The
second mate, who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been on
board our ship, and he told me, they had three passengers in the great cabin,
that were in u deplorable condition : "Nay," says he, " I believe they are.
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days: and I was
afraid to inquh'e after them," said he, "for I had nothing to relieve them
with." We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we
could spare; and, indeed, I had so far overruled things with my nephew,
that I would have victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia,
or any other part of the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but
there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating too
much, even of that little we gave them. The mate, or commander, brought
six men with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked like skeletons,
and were so weak that they could hardly sit to their ears. The male him-
self was very ill, and half-starved ; for he declared he. had reserved nothing
from the men, and went share and share alike with them in every hit they
ate. I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat before him immediately,
but he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of
order; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something will:
some broth, which he said would be to him both food and physio; and after
he had taken it he grew better. In the. mean time I forgot not the men.
I ordered vietuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured
than ate it: they were 'so exceedingly hungn'y that they were in a manner
ravenous, and had no eonnuand of themselves; and two of them are with
so much greediness, that they were in danger of their lives the ncx'
morning. The sight of these people's distress: was very moving to me, an
brought to mind what i had a terrible prospect of at my first coming on
shore in my island, where 1 had not the least mouthful of food, or any
prospect of procuring any ; besides the hourly apprehensions I had of being
made the feed of other creatures. But all the while the mate was thus

relating to me the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not
301
put out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures
in the great cabin, viz. the mother, her soufond tho maidservnnt, whom he
had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he seemed to confess.
they had wholly neglected, their own extremities being so grew; by which
I understood, that. they hail really given them no food at all, and that
therefore the],' must he perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps. on the floor
or deck of the cabin.

As l therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain. on board
with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that
were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and,

' with my mate andtwelve men, to carry them :1 seek of bread, and four or
five pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause lire meat
to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room. to
prevent the men taking it. to out row, or taking it out of the pot before it
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a time: and
by this cont-ion he preserved the- men, who would otherwise have killed
themselves with that very food that. was given them on purpose to save
their lives.

At the some time, I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin. and set-
what. condition the poor passengers were in; and if they were alive, to
comfort them, and give them what: refreshment was proper: and the
surgeon gave him 0. huge pitcher, with some of the pl'Opitl'CA'l broth which
he had given the mate that was on hoard, and which he did not quest-ion
would restore them gradually. I was not satisfied with this: but, as I said
above, having a great mind to see the scene of misery which I knew the
ship itself would present me with in a more lively manner than T could
have it. hyrepo1t,.[ took the captain of the ship, as we now called him, with
me, and went 1m self, 0. little after, in their boat.

I found the poor men on hoard almost in a, tumult, to get the victnals
out of the boiler before it was ready ~, but my mate observed his orders. and
kept a good guard at. the cook--room door, and the man he placed there,
after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them off by force :
however, he caused some biscuit- cakes to he dipped in the pol, and softened
with the liquor of the. meat, which they called hrcwis, and gave them every
one some, to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety
that he was obliged to give them but- little at a time, But it was all in
vain; and had I not come on hoard, and their own commander and officers

with me, and with good words, and some threats also of giving them no
302
more, I believe they would have broken into the cook-room by force, and
torn the meat out of the furnace--for words are indeed of very small force
to a hungry belly ; however, we pacified them, and fed them gnulually and
cautiously at first, and the next time gave them more, and at last filled
their bellies, and the men did well enough.

But: the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another
nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship's company had so
little for themselves, it was but too true that they had at first kept them
very low, and at last totally neglected them: so that for six or seven days
it might- be said they had really no food at all, and for several days before
very little The poor mother, who, as the men reparted, was a woman of
sense and good breeding, had spared all she could so affectionately for her
son, that at last she entirely sank under it ; and when the mate of our ship
went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her back up aguinst the sides.
between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her
shoulders like a. corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he could
to revive and encourage her, and with a. spoon put some broth into her
mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not. speak :
yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, inthnating that it
was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she Would have said they
should take care of him However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved
at the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth, and,
as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down--though I question whether
he could be sure of it or not: but it was too late, and she died the
same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the prior: of his most affectionate
mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one
stretched Out, with hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it; however, being young,
and having more strength than his mother, the mate got something down
his throat, and he began sensibly to revive; though by giving him, some
time after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordinarv, he was very sick, and
brought it up again.

But the next cure was the poor maid : she my all along upon the deck,
hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down in a fit of
apoplexy, and struggled for life Her limbs were distorted; one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of the chair, and she gripped it so hard

um we could not easily make her let it go; her other arm lay over her
308
head, and her feet lay both together, set fast against. the frame of the cabin
table: in short, she lay just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she
was alive too. The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us after-wards, was
broken--hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days
before, and whom she loved most tenderly. We knew not. what to do with
this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who was a man of very great know-
ledge and experience, had, with great application, recovered her as to life,
he had her upon his hands still; for she was little less than distracted for
a. considerable time after.

Whoever shall read these memorandum must he desired to consider,
that visits at see. are not. like a journey into the country, where sometimes
people stay a week or a fortnight at a place Our business was to relieve
this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them; and though they were
Irvilling to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we could carry no
sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts. However, as their captain
begged of us to help him to set up a muin-toPmast, and a kind of a. top-
most. to his jury-foremost, we did, us it were, lie by him for three or {our
days ; and then, having given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, t-wo
hogsheads of biscuit, and a, proportion of peas, flour, and what other things
We could spare; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some
pieces-of'eight from them for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board
with us, at their own earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all
their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a. pretty, well--bred,
modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his mother,
and also at having lost his fat-her but a few months before, at Barbadoes.
He begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship ; for
he said the cruel fellews'had murdered his mother: and indeed, so they
had, that is to say, passively; for they might have spared a small
sustenance to the poor helpless widow, though it had been but just enough
to keep her alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice
no right, and therefore is remorseless and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how for we were going, and that it would carry
him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad circumstances
almost as those we found him in, that is to say, starving in the world. He
said it mattered not Whither he Went, if he was but delivered from the

terrible crew that he was among ; that the captain (by which he meant rue,
304
for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was
sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to
herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry them where we
would. The surgeon represented the case so afl'ectionately to me that I
yielded, and we tool: them both on board, with all their goods, except
eleven hogslieads of sugar, which could not be removed or come at ; and as
the youth had a bill of hiding for them, I made his commander sign a
writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one
Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to
deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belonging to
the deceased widow; which i suppose was not done, for I could never learn
that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost at sea;
being in so disabled :2, condition, and so far from any land, that I am
of opinion the first storm she met with afterwards, she might founder, for
she was leaky, and had damage in her hold, when we met with her.

I was now in the latitude of 19deg 32', and had hitherto a tolerable voyage
as to Weather, though, at first, the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble
nobody with the little incidents of wind, weather, currents, &c. on the rest
of our voyage; but, to shorten my story, shall observe that I caine to my
old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April, 1695. It was with no
small diflioulty that I found the place ; for as 1' came to it, and went from
it, before, on the south and east side of the island, coming from the Brazils,
so now, coming in between the main and the island and having no chart
for the coast, nor any land-mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether I saw it or not We heat about a great while, and went on shore
on several islands in the mouth of the great river Oronooque, but none for
my purpose; only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was
under one great mistake before, viz. that the continent which I thought I
saw from the island I lived in, was reallyr no continent, but a long island,
or rather a. ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side of the
extended mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came to
my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees, but islanders,
and other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited nearer to our side
than the rest

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose; some I found
were inhabited, and some were not ; on one of them I found some
Spaniards, and thought they had lived there; but, speaking with them,
found they had a sloop lying in a Small creek hard by, and came thither to

305 3 R
make salt, and to catch some pearl-mussels if they could; but that they
belonged to the Isle do Trinidad, which lay farther north, in the latitude of
10 and 1.1 degrees.

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship,
sometimes with the Frenchman's shellop, which we had found it convenient
boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will, at length I came fair
on the south side of my island, and presently knew the very countenance
of the place: so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with the
little creek where my old habitation was As soon as I saw the place,
I called for Friday, and asked him if he knew where he was? He looked
about a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried, " 0 yes, 0 there, 0
yes, 0 there!" pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and oapering
like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into
the sea, to swim ashore to the place.

"W'ell, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find anybody here or
no? and do you think we shall see your father?" The follow stood mute
as a. stock a good while; but, when I named his father, the poor ufl'eotionate
creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very
plexil.ifully. " What is the matter, Friday? are you troubled because you
may see your fatheri'L--"No, no," says he, shaking his head, " no see him
more: no, never more see him again." " Why so, Friday? how do you
know that?"----"O no, 0 no," says Hidey, " he long ago die, long ago ; he
much old man." "Well, Well, Friday, you don't know; but shall we See
any one else then?" The Yellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he
points to the hill just above my old house; and though we lay half a.
league off, he cries out, "We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much man there,
and there, and there" I looked, but I saw nobody--mo, not with a
perspective glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place ;
for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day; and there
were five or six men all together, who stood to look at the ship, not
knowing what to think of us. .

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English ancient
to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice we were friends; and
in about a quarter of an hour after we perceived a smoke arise from the
side of the creek; so I immediately ordered the boat out, taking Friday
with me, and, hanging out a white flag, I went directly on shore, taking
with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the story of my

living there, and the manner of it and every particular, both of myself and
w.
those I left there, and who was, on that account, extremely desirous to go
with me "'0 had, besides, about sixteen men well armed, if we had
found any new guests them which we did not know of; but we had

no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, new high water, we rowed

directly into the creek; smrl [he first man I fixed my eye upon was the

well: as to his habit, I shall describe it afterwarde I ordered nobody to
go on shore at first; but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the
boat, for the affectionate clontnre had spied his father at a distance, it good
way 011' the Spaniards, where, indeed, I saw nothing of him; and if they
had not let him go ashore, he would have jtunpcd into the sea. He was no

nu."-
It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolution,
to have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to
his father: how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took him
"up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down by him; then
stood and looked at him, as any one would look at a. strange. picture, for a
quarter of on hour together; then lay down on the. groundfnud stroked
his legs, and kissed them, and then got up again, and stored at him; one
would have thought the fellow bewitched, But it would have made a dog
laugh the next day to see how his passion ran out another way: in the
morning, he walked along the shore, with his father, several hours, always
leading him by the hand, as if he had been a holy; and every now and
then he would come to the boat to fetch something or other for him,
either a. lump of sugar,'o dram, a biscuit, or something or other that was
good. In the. afternoon his frolics mi another way ; for then he would set
the old man down upon the ground, and dance about him, and make a
thousand antic gestures ; and all the while he did this, he would be talking
to him, and telling him one story or (mother of his travels, and fl what
had happened to him abroad, to divert him In short, if the same filial
affection was to be found in Christians to their parents, in our part of the
world, one would he tempted to say there would hardly have been any need
of the fifth commandment.

But this is a digression: I return to my lending. It would be needless
to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the Spaniards received
me with. The first. Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew very well, was he
whose life I had saved. He came towards the boat, attended by one more,
carrying a. flag of truce also ; and he not only did not know me at first, but
he hurl no thoughts, no notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to
him. " Senhor," sold I, in Portuguese, "do you not lmow me?" At which
he spoke not a word, but, giving his musket to the man that was with him,
threw his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that I did not perfectly
hear, come forward and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable not to
know that face again that he hurl once seen, as of an angel from Heaven,
sent to save his life : he said abundance of very handsome things, as o. well-
bred Spanim'd always knows how, and then, beckoning to the person that
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades He then asked me
il' I would walk to my old habitation, where he would give me possession
of my own house again, and where T should see they had made but mean

improvements. I walked along with him, but, alas l I could no more find
sax
the place than if I had never been there; for they had planted so many
trees, and placed them in such a position, so thick and close to one another,
and in ten years' time they were grown so big, that the place was inacces-
sible, except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves only.
who made them, could find.

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications: he told me
I would say there was need enough of it, when they had given me an
account how they had passed their time since their arriving in the island,
especially after they had the misfortiuie to find that I was gone. He told
me he could not but have some pleasure in my good fortune, when he heard
that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had
oftentimes a streng persuasion that one time or other he should see me
gain, but nothing that ever bcfell him in his life, he said, was so sur-
prising and afflicting to him at first, as the disappointment ho was under
when he came back to the island and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind,
and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all
thought themselves much better among the savmes, only that their number
was so small : " and," says he, " had they been strong enough, we had been
all long go in purgatory ; " and with that he crossed himself on the breast.
"But, sir." says he, " I hope you will not be displeased when 1' shall tell
you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation,
to disarm them, and make them our subjects, as they would not be con-
tent with being moderately our masters, but would be our murderers." I
answered, I was afraid of it- when I left them there, and nothing troubled
me at my parting from the island but that they were not come back, that I
might- have put them in possession of everything first, and left the others in
a state of subjection, as they deserved; but if they had reduced them to ll;
1 was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault with it:
for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were.
lit for any manner of mischief.

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had sent- back,
and with him eleven more. In the dress they were in, it was impossible to
guess what nation they were of ; but he made all clear, both to them and to.
me, First he turned to me, and pointing to them, said, " These, sir, are
some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ;" and then turning to:
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was ; upon which they

all came up, one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordinary
309
fellows, and the like, but mall)r as if they had been ambassadors or noble.
men, and I u. monarch or great conqueror: their behaviour was. to the last
degree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic
gravity, which very well became them; and, in short. they had so much
more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities,
much less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island, after my going
away, is so very remarkable, and has so mun y incidents, which the former
part of my relation will help to understand, and which will, in most of the
particulars, refer to the account I have already given, that I cannot but
commit them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come after me.

In order to do this as intelligibly as I can, I must go back to the
circumstances in which I left the island, and the persons on it, of whom I
an) to speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat that I had sent away
Friday's father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives 1 had rescued from
the savages) in a large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over
the Spaniards companions that he left behind him, in order to save them
from the like calamity that he had been in, and in order to suceonr them
for the present; and that, if possible, we might. together find some way for
our deliverance afterwards. When I sent them away, I had no visible
appearance of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more
than I had twenty years before--much less had I any foreknowledge of
what afierwards happened, I mean, of an English ship coming on shore there
to fetch me all; and it could not be but a very great surprise to them, when
they came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find three strangers
left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left behind me, which would
otherwise have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin
where I left oli; was of their own part; and I desired the Spaniard would
give me a particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the
boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was little
variety in that. part, for nothing remarkable happened to them on the way,
having had very calm weather, and a. smooth sen. As for his countrymen,
it eunlcl not be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see
him (it seems he was the principal man among them, the captain of the
vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been (lead some time): they
were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew that he was

fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour
:sio
him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners ; that when he told them the
story of his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for carrying
them away, it was like a dream to them, and their astonishment, he said, was
somewhat like that of Joseph's brethren when he told them who he was,
and the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when he showed
them the arms, the powder, the hull, the provisions, that he brought them
for their journey or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just.
share of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come-
away with him.

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were obliged
not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but to trespass upon ,their
friendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, on pretence
of going out a fishing, or for pleasure. In these they came away the next
morning, It seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready ; for they
had neither clothes, nor provisions, nor anything in the world but what
they had on them, and a. few roots to eat, of which they used to make their
bread. They were in all three weeks absent; and in that time, unluekily
for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I mentioned in the
other part, and to get off from the island, leaving three of the most im-
pudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains behind me, that any
man could desire to meet with--to the poor Spaniards' great grief and
disappointment:

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards came
ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them previsions, and other
relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave them the long paper of
directions which I had left with them, containing the particular methods
which I took for managing every part of my life there ; the way I baked
my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my com ; how I cured my
grapes, made my pets, and, in a. word, everything I did. All this being
written down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them understood English
well enough): nor did they refuse to aceommorlate the Spaniards with
anything else, for they agreed very well for some time. They gave them
an equal admission into the. house, or cave, and they began to live very
sociably ; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods,
together with Friduy's father, managed all their affairs; but as for the
Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots,
and catch tortoises; and when they came home at night, the Spaniards

provided their suppers for them
311
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the others but
let them alone, which, however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long; but, like the dog in the manger, they would not out themselves.
neither would they let the others eat. The differences, nevertheless, were at
first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating, but at last it broke out
into open war: and it began with all the rudeness and insolenee that can
be imagined--without reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, and,
indeed, to common sense ; and though, it is true, the first relation of it came
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accuseis, yet when I
come to examine the fellows, they could not deny a word of it.

But before I come to the partieulafs of this part, I must supply a defect
in my former relation; and this was, l forgot to set down, among the rest.
that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened a little
quarrel on board of our ship, which I was once afraid would have turned to
a second mutiny; nor was it a-ppeased till the captain, rousing up his
courage, and taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and.
making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons :
and as they hadbeen active in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly.
dangerous words, the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to
England, and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running away with
the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, fright-
ened some other men in the ship; and some of them had put it into the
head of the rest, that the captain only gave them good words for the present,
till they should come to some English port, and that then they should be all
put into gaol, and tried for their lives. The mate got intelligence of this,
and acquainted us with it, upon which it was desired that I, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go down with the mate, and
satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time past should he
pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honour's word to them, they
appeared easy, and the more so when I caused the two men that were in
irons to he released and Forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night ; the wind
also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men, who had been
laid in irons, had stolen each of them a musket, and some other weapons
(what powder or shot they had we knew not}, and had taken the ship's
pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run away with her to their

eompunions in roguery on shore. As soon as we found this, I ordered the
812
long-boat on shore with twelve men and the mute, and away they went to
seek the rogueze; but they could neither find them nor any of the rest, for
they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. The
mote was once resolved, in justice to their mguery, to have destroyed their
plantations, burned all their household stir-'1' and furniture, and left them to
shift- without it ; but having no orders, he let it all alone, left everything as
he found it, and, bringing the pinnace away, come on board without them.
These two men made their number five; but the other three villains were
so much more wicked than they, that alter they had been two or three
days together, they turned the two newcomers out of doors to shift for
themselves, and would have nothing to do with them; nor could they,
for a good while, be persuaded to give them any food : as for the Spaniards,
they were not yet come.

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go
forward: the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English brutes to
have taken in their countrymen again, that, us they said, they might be all
one family ; but they would not heur' of it, so the two poor fellows lived by
themselves; and finding nothing but industry and application would make
them live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of the.
island, but it little more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who
always landed on the east parts of the island, Here they built them two
huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up their magazines and stores in;
and the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and some of the
peas which I had left them, they dug, planted, and enclosed, after the pattern
I had set for them all, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn
was on the ground; and though it was but a little bit of land which they
had dug up at first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to
relieve them, and find them with bread and other eotables ; and one of the
fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making soup,
puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the milk, and such
little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.

They were going on in this little thriving position when the three
unnatural rogues, their own count-ymen too, in mere humour, and to insult
them, came and bullied them, and told them the. island was theirs : that the
governor, meaning me, hail given them the possession of it, and nobody else
had any right to it; and that they should build no houses upon their
ground, unless they would pay rent for them. The two men, thinking they
were jesting at first, asked them to come in and sit down, and see what

313 - SS1.1 l-'l-I AN 1) .-\D\' F..\"!'L' L'BS

fine houses they were that they had built, and to tell them what rent.
they demanded; and one of them merrily said, if they we .4 the ground-
lnndlords. he hoped, if they built tenements upon their land, and made
improvements, they would, according to the custom of landlords, grant it
long lease: and desired they would get a. scrivener to draw the writings.
One of the three, cursing (ind raging, told them they should see they were.
not in jest ; and going to 9. little place at a distance, where the honest men
had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a. firebrand, and claps it to
the outside of their hut, and set it on lire: indeed, it would have been all
burned down in in, few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fellow,
thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and that- not without
some dilliculty too,

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting him away,
that he returned upon him, with a pole he had in his hand, and had not the
man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended his
days at once. His comrade, eeeing the danger they were both in, run in
after him, and innnediately they came both out with their muskets, and the
man that was first>> struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down that
began the quarrel with the stock of his musket, and that before the other
two could come to help him ; and then seeing the rest come at them, they
stood together, and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade
them stund Ofl'. .

The others had lire-sums with them too ; but one of the two honest men, '
bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his danger, told them, if
they offered to move hand or foot, they were dead men, and boldly oom-
manded them to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, lay down
their arms. but seeing him so resolute, it. hrl'mghf. them to a. parley, and
they consented to take their wounded man with them and be gone: and,
indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow. How-
ever, they were much in the Wrong, since they had the advantage, that they
did not disarm them effectually, as they might have done, and have gone
immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an account how the rogues
had treated them; for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and
every day gave them some intimation thatthey did so.

But not to crowd this pix-rt with sin account of the lesser part of the
rogueries with which they plagued them continually night and day, it
forced the two men to such a. desPeralJon, that they resolved to fight- them

all three, the first time they had a fair opportunity. in order to do this,
31-1
they resolved to go to the castle (as they called my old dwelling), where
the three rogues and the Spaniards all Lived together at that time, intending
to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play'
so they got up in the morning before day, and came to the place, and called
the Englishmen by their names, telling a. Spaniard that answered, that
they wanted to speak with them.

It happened that the day before, two of the Spaniards, having been in the
woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I called
the honest men, .and he had made a. sad complaint to the Spaniards of
the barbarous usage they had met with from their three countrymen, and how
they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their corn that they had

laboured so haul to bring forward, and killed the much-gout, and their three
kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance; and that if he
and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not. assist them again, they
should be starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and they
were all at supper, one of them took the freedom to reprove the three
Englishmen, though in Very gentle and manner-1y terms. and asked them
how they could be so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive follows; that
they were putting themselves in a. way to subsist. by their labour, and that
it. had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as
they were then in.

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, " What had they to do
315
there? that they came on shore without. leave; and that they should not
plant or build upon the island; it was none of their ground." Why,"
says the Spaniard very calmly, " Seignior Inglese, they must not stuwe."
The Englishman replied, like a rough tarpauling, " They might starve ;.
they should not plant nor build in that place." " But what must they do
then, seignior?" said the Spaniard. Another of the brutcs returned, "Do?
they should be servants, and work for them." "But how can you expect-
that of them 2" says the Spaniard ; " they are not bought with your money ;.
you have no right to make them servants." The Englishman answered,
" The island was theirs ; the governor had given it to them, and no man had
anything to do there but themselves ; " and with that he swore that he would
go and burn all their new huts; they should build none upon their land.
'Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, " by the same rule, we must be your
servants too." " Ay," returned the bold dog, " and so you shall, too, before
we have done with you ;" mixing two or three oaths in the proper intervals-
of his speech The Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no answer.
However, this little discourse had heated them; and starting up, one says
to the other (I think it was he they called Will Atkins), " Come, J uok, let's
go, and have t'other brush with them; we'll demolish their castle, I'll
warrant you ; they shall plant no colony in our dominions."

Upon this they were all trooping away, with every man a gun, a pistol,
and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among themselves, of what
they would do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity oll'ered; but the
Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to know all the
particulars, only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the
two Englishnien's part, Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it seems they
wondered about the country part- of the night, and then lying down in the
place which I used to call my bower, they were weary and overslcpt them--
selves. The case was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and so
to take the two poor men when they were asleep, and as they acknowledged
afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts while they were in them, and
either burn them there, or murder them as they came out. As malice
seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should not have been
kept awake, However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it
happened, and very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad,

before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.
316
When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, who, it seems,
was the forwardcst man, called out to his comrade, " Ha, Jack, here's the
nest, but the birds are flown." They mused awhile, to think what should
be the occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested pre-
sently that the. Spaniards had given them notice of it. ; and with that they
shook hands, and swore to one another that they would be revenged of the
Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they felltowork
with the poor men's habitation -, they did not set fire, indeed, to anything,

 

. m>> =41:qu xxocxy. DOWN fur. niousa annon.

but they pulled down both their houses, not leaving the least stick standing,
or scarce any Sign on the ground where they stood; they tow all their
household stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in such a manner,
that the poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile off. When
they had done this, they pulled up all the mung trees which the poor men
had plank-d ; broke down an inclosure they had made to secure their cattle
and their corn; and, in a word, sucked and plundered everything as com-
pletely as a horde of Turtms would have done.

The .two men were, at this juncture. gone to find them out, and had
317 '
resolved to fight them wherever they had been though they were but two
to three; so that, had they met, there certainly would have been bloodshed
among them, for they were all very stout, resolute follows, to give them
their due. ,

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they them-
selves could do to meet; for, as if they had dogged one another, when the
three were gone thither, the two were here ; and afterwards, when the two
went- back to find them, the three were come to the old habitation again:
we shall see their dill'erent conduct presently. When the three came back
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they had been
about had put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what
they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping
up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys at play,
takes hold of his hot as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about,
fleeting in his face, says to him, "And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall
have the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners" The Spaniard,
who, though a quiet, civil man, was as brave a man as could be. and,
withal, a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good while, and then,
having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him. and, with one
blow of his list, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe; at
which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, tired his pistol at the
Spaniard immediately: be missed his body, indeed, for the bullets went
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled
pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt- than
he really was, and that put him into some heat, for before he acted all in a
perfect calm _: but now resolving to go through with his work, he stooped,
and taking the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, was just
going to shoot the man who had fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards,
being in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped
in, secured the other two, and took their arms from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the
Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, theSSr began to
cool, and, giving the Spaniards better words, would have had their arms
again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was between them and
the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best method they could
take to keep them from killing one another, told them they would do them
no harm; and if they would live peaceably, they would be very willing to
assist and associate with them as they did before ; but that they could not

' 318
think of giving them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to
do mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had even threatened
them all to make them their servants. '

The rogues were now quite deaf to all reason, and being refused their
arms, they raved away like madmen, threatening what they would do,
though they had no fire-arms. But the Spaniards, (leapising their threat-
ening, told them they should take cure how they olTered any injury to their
plantation or cattle: for if they did, they would shoot them as they would
ravenous beasts, wherever they found them; and if they fell into their
hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. However, this was far from
cooling them, but away they went, raging and swearing like furies. As soon
as they wore gene, the two men came hack, in passion and rage enough
also, though of another kind; for having been at their plantation, and
finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above mentioned, it will easily
be supposed they had provocation enough. They could scarce have. room
to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it
was strange enough to find that three men should thus bully nineteen, and
receive no punishment at all.

The Spimiards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having thus dis-
armed them, made light of their threatenings; but the two Englishmen
resolved to have their remedy gainst them, what pains soever it cost to
'find them out. But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, that
as they had disarmed them, they could not consent that they (the two)
should pursue them with the-arms, and perhaps kill them. " But," said the
grave Spaniard, who was their governor, " we Will endeavour to make them
do you just-ice, if you will leave it to us : for there is no doubt but they
'will come to us again, when their passion is over, being not able to subsist
without our assistance. We promise you to make no peace with them
without. having a full satisfaction for you; and, upon this condition, we
hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than in your own
defence." The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with
great reluctance ; but the Spaniards protested that they did it. only to keep
them from bloodshed, and to make them all easy at last. " For," said they,
" we. are. not so many of us ; here is room enough for us all, and it. is a great
pity that we should not be all good friends." At length they did con-
sent, and waited for the issueof the thing, living for some days with the
Spaniards ', for their own habitation was destroyed.

In about tvc days' time the vagrants, tired with wandering, and almost
319
starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while,
Come back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was
the governor, and two more with him, walking by the side of the creek,
they came up in a. very submissive, humble manner, and begged to be
received again into the society. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told
them they had acted so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very grossly
to themselves, that they could not come to any conclusion without con-
sulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they would go to
them and discourse about it, and they should know in half an hour. It.
may be guessed that they were very hard put to it; for. as they were
to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged they would send
them out some bread in the mean time, which they did, sending, at the
same time, a large piece of goat's flesh, and a boiled parrot. which they use
very eagerly.

After half an hour's consultation they Were called in, and u. long debate
ensued, their two countrymen chin-gins! them with the ruin of all their labour,
and a. design to murder them; all which they owned before, and therefore
could not deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not or: hurt
the three while they were naked and unarmed. so they new obliged the
three to go and rebuild their Fellows" two huts, one to be of the same and
the other of larger dimensions than they were before ; to fence their ground
again, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again for
planting corn, and, in n word. to restore everything to the same state as
they found it, that is, as near as they could,

Well, they submitted to all this 3 and as they had plenty of provisions
given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the whole society
began to live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only that. these
three fellows could never be persuaded to work--l mean for themselves--
except now and then u. little, just as they pleased : however, the Spaniards
told them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study the good of the whole plantation, they would be content to work
for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased ; und thus,
having lived pretty well together for a. month or two, the Spaniards let them
have arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them as before.

It was not above a. week after they had these arms, and went abroad.
before the ungratcfid creatures began to be as insoleut and troublesome as

ever: however, an accident happened presently upon this, which endangered
320
the safety of them all, and they were obliged to lay by all private resent
menus, and look to the preservation of their lives. '

It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard whose life I had
saved, who was now the governor of the rest, Found himself very uneasy
in the night, and could by no means get any sleep: he was perfect-1y well in
body, only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind run upon men fighting
and killing one another; but he. was broad awake, and could not hy any
means got any sleep ; in short, he lay a great while, but, growing more and
more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, on goal;--
skina laid thick upon such (benches and pads as they made for themselves,
so they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get upon
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it. was, and their pumps, and
they were ready for going any way that their thoughts guided them. Being
thus got up, he looked out ; but, being dark, he could see little or nothing,
and, besides, the trees which I had planted, und which were now grown tall,
intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see that it was a
starlight night, and, hearing no noise, he returned and lay down ngain ; but
to no purpose: he could not compose'himseh' to anything like rest; but
his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going out and
coming in, another of them waked, and asked who it was that was up. The
governor told him how it had been with him. "Say you so?" says the
other Spaniard; " such things are not to he slighted, I assure you ; there is
certainly some mischief working ncm' us ;" and presently he asked him, ,
" Where are the Englishmen 2"--" They are all in their huts," says he, "safe
enough." lt seems the Spaniards had kept possession of the main apart-
ment, and had made a place for the three Englishmen, who, since. their lust
mutiny, were always quartered by themselves, and could not come at the
rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, " there is something in it, I am persuaded,
from my own experience. I am satisfied that our spirits embodied have a.
converse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits unembodied, and
inhabiting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for our
advantage, if we know how to make use of it Come, let us go and look
abroad ;' and if we find nothing 9.1. 11.11 in it to justify the trouble, I'll tell
you it story to the purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my
proposing it"

They went out presently, to go up to the top of the hill, where I' used

to go; but they being strong, and a good company, nor alone, as I was, used
321 '1' :r
nOne of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and pulling it up after them,
to go up a socond stage to the top, but were going round through the grove,
unwarily, when they were surprised with seeing a. light as of fire, a very
little way from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one or two,
but of agrcat number.

Among the precautions I used lo take on the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant euro to prevent them making the least- dis-
covery of there being any inhabitant upon the place; and when by any
occasion they came to know it, they felt. it so ell'ectnally that they that got
away were scarce able to give any account of it 5 for we disappeared as soon
as possible ,1 nor did over any that had seen me escape to tell any one else,
except it was the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the
boat; of whom, i mentioned, l was afraid they should go home and bring
more help. Whether it was the consequence of the escape of those men
that so great a number come now together, or whether they came ignorantly,
and by accident, on their nsuat bloody errand, the Spaniards could not
understand ; but, whatever it. was, it. was their business either to have con--
(zealed themselves, or not to have seen them at all, much less to have lot the
savages have seen there were any inhabitants in the place ; or to have fallen
upon them so eli'ectually as not a man of them should have escaped, which
could only have been by getting in between them and their boats : but this
presence of mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tran-
quillity for a great while.

We need not doubt but that. the governor and the man with him, sur-
prised with this sight, ran back immediately and raised their fellows, giving
them an account of the imminent danger they were all in, and they again
as readily took the alarm ', but it was impossible to persuade them to stay
close within where they were, but they must all run out to see how things
stoodi While it was dark, indeed, they were safe, and they had Opportunity
enough, for some hours, to View the savages by the light- of three fires they
had made at a. distance from one another ; what the), were doing the -' knew
not, neither did they know what to do themselves. For, first, the enemy
were too many ; and, secondly, they did not keep together, but wore divided
into several parties, and were on shore in several places.

The Spaniards were in no small ccnstcrnatimi at this sight ; and, as they
found that the Fellows went straggling all over the shore, they made no
douht'hnt, first or lost, some of them would chop in upon their habitation,

or upon some other place where they would see the token of inhabitants ;
322
and they were in great perplcxity also for fear of their flock of goats, which,
if they should be destroyed. would have been little less than starving them,
So the first thing they resolved upon was to dcsputch three men away lcfore
it was light, two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away
to the great valley where the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them
into the very cave itself. Could they have seen the savages altogether in
one body, and at a. distance from their canoes, they were resolved, if there
had been a hundred of them, to attack them ; but that could not be done,
for they were some of them two miles 013' from the other ; and, as it appeared
afterwards, were of two dill'erent nations.

After having mused a. great while on the course they should take, they
resolved, at last, while it was still dark, to send the old savage, Friday's
father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them--~83
what they came for, what they intended to do, end the like. The old men
readily undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the
savages were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he
brings word that he had been among them rmdiscwered,~--that he found
they were two parties, and of two several nations, who had war with
one another, and had 9. great battle in their own country; and that both
sides having had several prisoner's taken in the fight, they were, by more
chance, Landed all on the same island, for the devouring their prisoners and
making merry; but their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled
all their mirth--that they were in a. great mge at one another, and were so
near, that he believed they would light again as soon as (loyhght began to
appear; but he did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made on end of telling
his story, when they could perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that
the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight Friday's father used
all the arguments he could to persuade our people to lie close, and not be
soon; he told them their safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to
do but lie still, and the savages would kill one another to their hands, and
then the rest would go away ', end it was so to u tittle. But it was impos-
sible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so
import-unutc, that'they must run out and see the battle ; however, they used
some caution, the : they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but
went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they
' might securely see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be seen
by them; but thesavages did see them, as we shall find hereafter.

323
The battle was very fierce ; and, if I might believe the Englishmen, one of
them said he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery,
of invincible spirits, and of great pol icy in guiding the light The battle,
they said, held two hours before they could guess which party would lie
beaten; but. then that party which was nearest our people's habitation
began to appear weakest, and after some time more, some of them began to
fly; and this put our men again into a great consternation. lest. any one of
those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter,
and thereby involuntarily discover the place ', and that, by consequence, the
pursuers would also do the like in search of them. Upon this, the.)' resolved
that the)' would stand armed within the wall, and whoever came into the
grove, they msolred to sally out over the wall and kill them, so that, if
possible, not one should return to give an account- of it; they ordered also
that it should he done with their swords, or by knocking them down with
the stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear of raising
an aim in l>> the. noise

As they expected it fell out: three of the routed army fled for life, and
crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least knowing
whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter, The scout
they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this comforting
addition, that the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way
they were gone; upon this, the Spaniard governor, a. man of humanity,
would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, hut sending three men out
by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in behind them, and
surprise and take them prisoners; which was done. The residue of the
conquered people {led to their canoes, and gul- otl" to sea ; the victors retired,
made no pursuit, or very little, but (lruwing themselves into a. body together,
gave two great screaming shouts, most likel)r by way of triumph--11nd so the
fight. ended: the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had the island again free
to themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages for several
years afier.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and
viewing the field of hattle, they found about two-and-th'irty men dead on
the spot; some were killed with long arrows, which were found sticking
in their bodies; but most of them were killed with great wooden swords,
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle, and as

many bows, with a great many arrows. These swords were Me,
324
unwieldy things, and they must be very strong men that used them;
most of those that were killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces,
as we may say, or, as we call it. in English, their brains knocked out, and
several their arms and legs broken; so that it is evident- they fight with
inexpressihle rage and fury. We found not one man that was not stone
dead; for either they stay by their enemy till they have killed him, or
they curry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with them

This delivemnco tamed our ill--disposed Englishmen for a. great while;
the sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared
terrible to the last degree, especially upon supposing that some time or
other they should fall into the hands of those creatures, who would not
only kill them as enemies, but for food, as we kill our cattle; and they
professed to me that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef and mutton,
though it was supposed it was not to he till they were dead, had something
in it so horrible that it nauseatcd their very stomachs, made them sick
when they thought of it, and filled their minds with such unusual terror,
that they were not themselves for some weeks after This, as I said, turned
even the three English brute: l have been speaking of; and for a great
while. after they were tractable, and went about the common business of
the whole society well enough--planted, sowed, leaped, and began to be
all naturalized to the country. But some time after this they fell into
such simple measures again, as brought them into a great deal of trouble,

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed ; and these three being
stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them to work
for them, and as slaves they did well enough ; but they did not take their
measures as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin with them upon the
principle of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the rational
principles of life; much less did they think of teaching them religion, or
attempt civilizing and reducing them by kind usage and afiectionate argu-
ments. As they gave them their food every day, so they gave them their
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough; but they
failed in this by it, that they never had them to assist them and fight for
them as 1 had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh
upon my honest '

But to come to the family pint. Being all now good friends--for
common danger, as I said above, had effectually inconcilcd them-they
begun to consider their general circumstances; and the first thing that

came under consideration was whether, seeing the savages particularly
325
haunted that side of the island, and that there were more remote and
retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and manifestly
to their advantage, they should not rather move their habitation, and
plant in some more proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn.

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would not
remove their habitation; because that, some time or other, they thn'qht
they might hear from their governor again, meaning me; and if I should
send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that side,
where, if they should find the place demolished, they would conclude
the savages had killer] us all, and we were gone, and so our supply
would go too. But, as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the valley where my care was, where the land was as proper
for both, am where, indeed, there was land enough. However, upon
second thoughts, they altered one part of their resolution too, and resolved
only to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part of their corn
there; so that if one part was destroyed, the other might he saved,
And one part of prudence they luckily used: they never trusted those
three savages which they had taken prisoners with knowing unfihing of
the plantation they had made in that volley, or of any cattle they had
there, much less of the cave at that place, which they kept, in case of
necessity, as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also the two barrels
of powder, which I had sent them at my coming away. They resolved,
however, not to change their habitation ;. yet, as I had carefully covered
it first with a wall or fortification, and then with a grove of trees, and
as they were now fully convinced their safety consisted entirely in their
being concealed, they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more
effectually than before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather
thrust in stokes, which in time all grew up to he trees, for some good
distance before the entrance into my apartments, they went on in the
same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground from
the trees J. had set quite dawn to the side of the creek, where I landed
my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so much
as leaving any place to land, or any Sign that. there had been any landing
thereahouts,--these stakes also being of a. wood very forward to grow,
they took care to have them generally much larger and taller than those
which I had planted. As they grew space, they planted them so very

thick and close together, that when they had been three or four years
326
grown, there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into
the plantation As for that part which I had planted, the trees were
grown 'as thick as 9. man's thigh, and among them they had placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that it stood like a. palisudo a quarter
of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it, for a little
dog could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close,

But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground to the
.right hand and to the left, and round even to the side of the hill, leaving
no w; y, not so much as for themselves, to come out but by the ladder
placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again
from the first stage up to the top: so that when the ladder was taken
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could come
at them. This was excellently well contrived: nor was it less than what
they afterwards found occasion for, which served to convince me, that. as
human prudence has the authority of Providence to' justify it, so it has
doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to Work ; and if we listened
carefully to the voice of it, I am per-Snailed we might prevent many
of the disasters which our lives are now, by our own negligence. sub'
jeeted to.

They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and had no
more visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an alarm given them
one morning, which put them into a great consternation; for, some of the
Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side, or end, of the
island (which was that end where I never went, for fear of being dis-
covered), they were surprised with seeing aboveetwenty canoes of Indians
just coming on shore. They made the best of their way home in hurry
enough; and giving the. alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that
day and the next, going out only at night to make their observation; but
they had the good luck to be undiscovered, for wherever the savages
went, they did not land that time on the island, but pursued some other
design. ' .

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one
of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the three
captive slaves, because the fellow had not done something right which
he'bid him do, and seemed a little untraetahle in his showing him, drew
a hatchet out of a frog--belt, which he were by his side, and fell upon
the poor savag, not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the
Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with

the hatchet, which be aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulder,
so that he thought he had cut the poor creature's arm qfl', Til-n to him,
and, cum-eating him not to murder the poor man, placed himself between.
him and the savage, to prevent the mischief. The follow, being enraged
the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he

' would serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard
828
perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he had in his
hand (for they were all working in the field about their corn land) knocked
the brute down. Another of the Exglishmen, running up at the some
time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and then two
Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a third Englishman fell
in upon them. They had none of them any fire-arms or any other weapons
but hatehets: and other tools, except this third Englishman; he had one of
my rusty cutlusses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards, and
wounded them both. This fray set the whole fannily in an uproar, and
more help coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, what should be done 'with them? They had been so
often mutinous, and were so very furious, so rlespemle, and so idle withal,
they knew not what course to take with them, for they were mischievous
to the highest degree, and cared not what hurt they did to any man; so
that, in short, it was not. safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, that
if they had been of his own country, he would have hanged them; for
all laws and all governors were to preserve society. and those who were
dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were
Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would use them
with all possible lonity, and would leave them to the judgment of the
other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen. One of the two honest
Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it might not be left to them,--
"For," says he, "I am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows ; "
and with that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three,
had proposed to have all the live Englishmen join together, and murder
all the Spaniards when they were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins, " How,
Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? What have you to say to that?"
The hardened villain was so far from denying it, that he said it was true,
and swore they would do it- still before they had done with them "Well,
but Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "what have we done to you, that
you will kill us? What would you get by killing us? And what must
we do to prevent you killing us? Must we kill you, or you kill us?
Why will you put- us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" says the:
Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a. rage at
the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three

329 u u
men, and withal had no Weapon near him, it was thought he would have
attempted to lcill the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. This
hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to be
done. The two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage,
were of the opinion that they should hung one of the three, for an example
to the rest, and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted
to commit murder with his hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to
believe he had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable
oondition with the wound he had received, that it- was thought he could
not live. But the governor Spaniard still said no; it was an Englishman
that had saved all their lives, end he would never consent to put an
Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he
said if he hurl been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time left
to speak, it should he that they should pardon him.

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that there
was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most opt to prevail,
where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it
was to he considered what should he done to keep them from doing the
mischief they designed; for all agreed, governor and all, that means were
to be. used for preserving the society from danger. After a long debate, it
was agreed that they should he dis-armed, and not permitted to have either
gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon ; that they should he turned out
of the society, and left to live where they would, and how they would, by
themselves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should
hold any kind of converse with them, or have anything to do with them:
that they should he forbid to come within a certain distance of the place
where the rest dwelt-,2 and if they offered to commit any disorder, so as to
spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or
cattle belonging to the society, they should die without- merey, and would
shoot. them wherever they could find them.

The humane governor, musing upon the sentence, considered a little upon
it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, "Hold; you must
reflect that it will be long are they can misc corn and cattle of their own,
and they must not starve; we must therefore allow them provisions." So
be caused to he added, that they should have a proportion of corn given
them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time they
might be supposed to raise some of their own ; that they should have six
n'iilch-goats, four lie-goats, and six l-Iids given them, as well for present

330
subsistence as for o store ; and that they should have tools given them for
their work in the fields, but they should have none of these tools or pro-
visions, unless they would swear solemnly that. they would not hurt or
injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift for
themselves, They went away sullen and refracton', (LS neither content to
go away nor to stay ; but, as there was no remedy, they went, pretending to
go and choose a. place where they would settle themselves; and some
provisions were given them, but no weapons. About four or five days after,
they came gain for some victuals, and gave the governor an account where
they had pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation; and it- was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest
part of the island, NE, much about the place where I providentially landed
in my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea, in my foolish attempt to
soil round the island. ' ,

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them in a.
manner like my first habitation, being close under the side of a hill, having
some trees growing already on three sides of it, so that by planting others, it
would he very easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for.
The}! desired some dried gout-skins, for beds and covering, which were given
them ; and upon giving their words that they would not disturb the rest, or-
injure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what other
tools they could spare; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing; and, in
a. word, anything they wanted, except arms and ammunition

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got in
their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, the parcel of land
they had planted being but little. Indeed, having all their plantation to-
form, they had a. grout dead of work upon their hands; and when they
come to make boards and pots, and such things, they were quite out of
their element, and could make nothing of it; therefore, when the rainy
season came on, for want of a cave in the earth they could not keep their
grain dry, and it, was in great danger of spoiling. This humbled them
much: so they come and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they
very readily did; and in four days worked a grout hole in the side of the
hill for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things from the
rain: but it was a poor place at best, conmured to mine, and especially as
mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several

new apartments in it.
831 ,
About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic took
these rogues, which, together with the former villnny they had committed,
brought- mischief enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin
of the whole colony. The three new associates begun, it seems, to he
weary of the laborious life they led, and that without hope of bettering
their circumstances : and a. whim took them that they would make a voyage
to the. continent, from whence the savages come, and would try if they
could seize upon some prisoners wrong the natives there, and bring them
home, so as to make them do the laborious port of the work for them.

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no further. But
they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had either mischief in the
design, or mischief in the event. And if I may give my opinion, they
seemed to be under a blast from Heaven; for if we will not allow a
visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of
things with the Divine justice 2 _ It was certziinly an apparent vengeance on
their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they were
in; and they showed not the least remorse for the crime, but added new
villanics to it, such as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor
.slave because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he
directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple all his
life, and in a place Where no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure ;
and, what was still worse, the intentional murder, for such to he sure it was.
.as was afterwards the formed design they all laid, to murder the Spaniards
in cold blood, and in their sleep.

The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very
humble terms desired to he admitted torspeek with them. The. Spaniards
very readily hcurd what they had to say, which was this :--that they were
'tired of living in the manner they did, and that they were not handy
enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and that having no help, they
found they should be starved ; but if the Spaniards would give them leave
to take one of the. canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and
ammunition proportioned to their defence, they would go over to the main,
and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying
them with any other provisions.

The Spnnicrds were glad enough to get rid of them, but very honestly
represented to them the certain destruction they were running into; told
them they had sullered such hardships upon that very spot, that they could,

without any spirit of prophecy, tell them they would he starved or murdered,
a 332
. and bade them consider of it The men replied audaciously, they should
be starved if they stayed here, for they could not work, and would not
work, and they 'oonld but he starved abroad; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them; they had no wives or children to cry after
them; and, in short, insisted importunalely upon their demand, declaring
they would go, whether they gave them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were resolved
to go, they should not go like naked men, and be in no condition to defend
themselves; and that though they could ill spare fire-arms, not having.
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol,
and a. cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought was sufficient
for them. In a word, they accepted the offer; and, having baked bread
enough to serve them a. month given them, and us much goat's ilesh as
they could eat while it was sweet, with a great basket of dried grapes, in pot
of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a
voyage over the see, where it was at least forty miles broad. The boat,
indeed, was a. large one, and would very well have carried fifteen or twenty
men, and therefore was rather too big for them to manage; but as they
had a fair breeze and flood--tide with them, they did well enough. They
had made a must of a. long pole, and a sail of four large goat--skins dried,
which they had sowed or laced together; and away they went merrily
enough. The Spaniards called after them, " Ban wyajo ,- " and no man ever
thought of seeing them any more.

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two honest
Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and cmnfortubly they lived,
now these three turbulent fellows were gone. As for their coming again,
that was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could be imagined;
when, behold, alter two-and--twenty days' absence, one of the Englishmen,
being abroad upon his planting-work, sees three strange men coming
towards him at u distance, with guns upon their shoulders.

Away runs the Englishmen, frightened and amazed, as if he was be-
wilohed, to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone,
for there were strangers upon the island, but he could not tell who
they were. The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, "How do you
mean--you cannot tell who? They are the savages, to be sure."--".No,
no," says the Englishman; " they are men in clothes, with arms." "Nay,
then," says the Spaniard; " why are you so concerned? If they are not

savages, they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation upon earth
338
but will do us good rather tlnm harm." While they were debating
thus, came up the three Englishmen, and, standing without the wood,
which was new planted, hallooed to them. "hey presently knew their
voices, and so 11.1] the. wonder ceased. But. now the admiration was turned
upon another question :--what could he the matter, and what made them
come back again? _

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring where
they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a full
account. of their voyage in a few words :--that they reached the land in
less than two days, but finding the people alarmed at their coming, and
preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, they (lurst not go on shore,
hut sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till they came to a great
opening, by which they perwived that the land they saw from our island
was not the main, but an island: that upon entering that. opening of the sea,
they saw another island on the right hand north, and several more west ; and
being resolved to land soincwhcre,'thcy put over to one of the islands which
lay west, and went boldly on shore; that they found the people very courteous
and friendly to them ; and they gave. them Several roots and some dried fish.
and appeared very sociable; and that the women, as well as the men, were
very forward to supply them with anything they could get for them to eat,
and brought it to them a great way upon their heads. They continued
here four days, and inquired, as well as they could of lhem by signs, whut
nations were this way, and that way, and were told of several fierce and
terrible people that lived almost every way, who, as they made known by
signs to them, used to eat. men ; but, as for themselves, they said, they never
ate men or women, except only such as they took in the wars; and then
they owned they made a great. feast, and ate their prisoners.

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that kind ; and
they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon and to two
fingers 5 and that their great king haul two hundred prisoners now, which he
had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat for the
next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desimus ol' seeing those
prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought they were desirous to
have some of them to carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned
to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising; which
was to signify that the next morning at sunrising they would bring some
for them: and, uuwrdingly, the next morning they brought down five
women and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with

334
them on their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down
to a' seaport town to victnel a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their stomachs.
turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do. To refuse the pri-
soners would have been the highest alfront lo the savage gentry that enuld
be offered them, and what to do with them they knew not However, after
some debate, they resolved to accept of them ; and, in return, they gave the-
snvuges that broght them one of their hetehets, an old key, a knife, and six
or seven of their bullets ; which, though they did not understand their use.
they seemed particularly pleased with ; and then tying the poor creatures"
hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the boot for our men.

The Eglishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had them,
or else they that gave them this noble present would certainly have expected
that they should have gone to work with them, have killed two or three of'
them the next morning, and, perhaps, have invited the donors to dinner.
But having taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks that could
well' pass between people, where, on either side, theyr understood not one
word they could say, the ' put 013' with their boat, and came back towards
the 'first island; where, when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners
at liberty, there being too many of them for their occasion In their
voyage. they endeavoured to have some eommunieation with their prisoners;
but it was impossible to make them understand anything. Nothing they
could say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was looked upon as
going to murder them. They first of all unbound them; but the poor
creatures screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had just felt the
knife at their throats; for they immediately concluded they were unbound
on purpose to be killed. If they gave them anything to eat, it was the.
some thing; they then concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh,
and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more per-
tieularly, the party presently concluded it was to see whether he or she was
fattest, and fittest to kill first ; nay, after they had brought them quite over,
and began to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they expected
every day to make a dinner or supper for their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or journal
of their voyage the Spaniard asked them where their new family was; and
being told that they had brought them on shore, and put them into one of'
their huts, and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they (the

Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony,
335
resolved to go all down to the place and see them ; and did so, and Friday's
father with them, When they came into the hut, there they eat, all hound ;
for when they had brought. them on shore, they bound their hands, that
they might not take the boat and make their escape ; there, I say, they sat,
all of them stark naked. First, there were three comely fellows, well
shaped, with straight limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age ; and five
women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two more about four or
five-and-twenty ; and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about seventeen. The
women were well-favomed, agreeable persons, both in shape and features,
only tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect white, would have
passed for very handsome women, even in London, having pleasant coun--
tenances, and of a very modest behaviour; especially when they came
afterwards to be clothed and dressed, though that dress was very indifferent,
it must he confessed.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards,
who were, to give them a just character, men of the most calm, sedate
tempers, and perfect good humour, that ever I met with ; and, in particular,
of the most modesty : I say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked
men and five naked women, all together bound, and in the most miserable
circumstances that human nature could be supposed to be. viz. to be ex-
pecting every moment to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked
out, and then to be. eaten up like a calf. that is killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's father. to
go in, and see first if he knew any of them, and then if he understood any
of their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at
them, but knew none of them; neither could any of them understand a
word he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women. However,
this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy them that the men
into whose hands they were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred
eating men or women; and that they might be sure they"\\vould not he
killed. As soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy,
and by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for it
seems they were of several nations. The woman who was their interpreter
was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they were willing to be servants,
and to work for the men who had brought them away, to save their lives;
at which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this,
and another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their shoulders

to intimate they were willing to work.
386
The governor, who found that the having women among them would
presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion some
strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intended to do
with these Mama, and how they intended to use them, whether as servants
_ or as wives? One of the Englishmen answered, very boldly and readily,

that they would use them as both; to which the governor said: "I am not
going to restrain you from it--you are your own masters as to that; but
this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and
I desire it of you for that reason only, viz. that you will all engage, that
if any of you take any of these women as a. wife, he shall take but one;
and that, havingr taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we
cannot marry any one of you, yet- it is but reasonable that, while you stay
here, the woman any of you takes shall be maintained by. the man that
- takes her, and should be his wife--I mean," says he, " while he continues
here, and that none else shall have anything to do with her." All this
appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without any difficulty.

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to take any
oi them? But every one of them answered " No." Some of them said they
had wives in Spain, and the others did not like women that were not
Christians; and all together declared that they would not touch one of
them, which was an instance of such virtue as l have not met with in all
my travels. On the other hand, the five Ernglishmen took them every one
a. wife--that is to say, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new form of
living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old habitation,
which they had enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants which-
were taken in the last battle of the savages lived with them; and these
carried on the main part of the. colony, supplied all the rest with food,
and assisted them in anything as they could, or as they found necessity
required.

But- the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, ill-matched
fellows should agree about these women, and that some two of them should
not choose the some woman, especially seeing two or three of them were,
without comparison, more agreeable than the others; but they took a good
way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves, for they set the five
women by themselves in one of their huts, and they went all into the other
hut, and drew lots among them who should choose first. _

Him that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where
the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he chose; and it was

337 x x
worth observing, that he that chose first took her that wa's reckoned the
homelicst and oldest of the live, which made mirth enough among the rest ;
and even the Spaniards laughed at it ; but the fellow considered better than
any of them, that it- was application and business they were to expect
assistance in, us much as in anything else ; and she proved the best wife of
all the parcei

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and fetched
out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon them again, and
they firmly believed they were now going to be devoured. Accordingly,
when the English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set
up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her
with such agoniea and affection as would have grieved the hardest heart in
the world; nor was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they
were not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's
father, who immediately let them know that the five men, who were to
fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for their wives. When they
had done, and the fright the women were in was a. little over, the men went
to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them; and in a few hours
they had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart,
for those they had already were crowded with their tools, household stall,
and provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest oil, and the
two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so that
they continued separated as before; and thus my island was peopled in
three places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be built

And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often happens in
the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are, in such a disposition
of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two worst wives;
and the three reprohates, that were sear-cc worth hanging, that were fit for
nothing, and neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor any one else,
had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious wives; not. that the first
two were bad wives, as to their temper or humour, for all the five were
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than
wives; but- my meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or
industrious, or alike cleanly and neat Another observation I must make,
to the honour of a diligent application on one hand, and to the disgrace of
a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the other, that when I came to the
place, and viewed the several unprovernents, plantings, and mangement of

the several little colonies, the two men had so far outgone the three, that
ass
there. was no comparison. They had, indeed, both of them as much ground
laid out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was, because, according to
my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more com than
they wanted; but the difference of the cultivation, of the planting, of the
fences, and, indeed, of everything else, was easy to be seen at first view.
The two 'lncn had innumerable young trees planted about their huts, so
that, when you came to the place, nothing was to be seen but a wood ; and
though they had twice had their plantation demolished, once by their own
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet
they had restored all again, and everything was thriving and flourishing
about them ', they had grapes planted in order, and managed like a. vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen anything of that kind; and, by
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again as any of
the others. They haul also found themselves out>> a retreat in the thickest
pint of the woods, where, though there was not a natural cave, as I had
found, yet they made one with incessant labour of their hands, and where,
when the mischief which followed happened, they secured their wives and
children so as they could never be found; they having, by sidekiw innu-
memble stakes and poles of the wood which, as I said, grew so readily,
made the grove impassable, except in some places, when they climbed up to
get over the outside part, and then went- on by way: of their own leaving.
As to the three reprohates, as I justly call them, though they were much
civilized by their settlement compared to what they were before, and were
not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity ; yet one of the certain
companions of a profligatc mind never left them, and that was their idle-
ness. It is true, they planted corn,-and made fences; but Solomon's words
were never better verified than in them, " I went by the vineyard of the
slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns : " for when the Spaniards
came to view their crop, they could not see it in some places for weeds, the
hedge had sevend gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten up
the corn; perhaps here and there a (lead bush was crammed in, to stop
them out for the present, but it wus only shutting the stable-door after the
steed was stolen. Whereas, when they looked on the colony of the other
two, there was the very face of industry and success upon all they did;
there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn, or a. gap in any of their
hedges; and they, on the other hand, verified Solomon's words in another
place, "that the diligent hand makcth rich;" for everything grew and
thrived, and they had plenty within and without: they had more. tame
389
cattle than the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet
more pleasure and diversion too.

It is true, the wires of the three were very handy and cleanly within
doors ; and having learned the English ways of dressing and cooking from
one of the other Englishmen, who, as 1 said, was a cook's mate on board the
ship, they dressed their husbands" victuals very nicely imd well; whereas
the others could not be brought to understand it; but then the husband,
who, as I say, had been cook's mate, did it himself. But as for the husbands.
of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched tuitlcs' eggs, and caught fish
and birds; in a word, anything but labour; and they fared accordingly.
The diligent lived well and comfortably, and the slothful hard and beggarly:
and so, I believe, generally speaking. it is all over the world.

But 1 now come to it scene difi'erent from all that had happened before,
either to them or to me; and the origin of the story was this z--Early one
morning, there came on shore five or six canoes of Indians or savages, call.
them which you please, and there is no room to doubt they come upon the
old errand of feeding upon their slaves ; but that part was now so familiar
to the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not Concern themselves
about it, as I did : but having been made sensible, by their experience, that
their only business was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by
any of the savages, they would go off again quietly, when their business was
done, having, as yet, not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in
the island; I say, having been imide sensible. of this, they had nothing to
do but to give notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors, and
not show themselves, only placing a. scout in a proper place, to give notice
when the hosts went. to sea again.

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled all these
measures, and made it known among the savages that there were inhabit-
ants there. ; which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole
colony. After the canoes with the savages were gone oil", the Spaniards
pooped abroad again; and some of them had the curiosity to go to the
place where they had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to
their great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lying fast
asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they had either been so gorgcd
with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were fallen asleep, and
would not stir when the others went, or they had wandered into the woods,
and did not come back in time to be taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a

340
1085 what to do, The Spaniard governor, as it happened, was with them, and
his advice was asked, but he professed he knew not what to do. As for
slaves, they had enough already; and as to killing them; there were none
of them inclined to do that: the Spaniard governor told me, they could
not think of shedding innocent blood ; for as to them, the poor creatures
had done them no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they thought
they had no just quarrel against then), to take away their lives. And here
I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts of
Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met with
seventeen men of any notion Wllntsoever, in any foreign country, who were
so universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so
courteous, as those Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in
their very nature: no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions;
and yet all of them men of great- courage and spirit Their temper and
calmness had appeared in their hearing the insufferable usage of the three
Englishmen ; and their justice and humanity appeared now in the case of
the savages as above. After some consultation, they resolved upon this;
that they would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three men
might be gone. But then the governor recolleeted that the three savages
had no boat; and if they were left to rove about the island, they would
certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it; and so they should be
undone that way. Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the
fellows fast asleep still, and so they resolved to awaken them, and take
them prisoners; and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely
frightened when they were seized upon and bound ; and afraid, like the
women, that they should be murdered and eaten : for it seems, those people
think all the world does as they do, in eating men's flesh ; but they were
soon made easy as to that, and away they carried them.

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home. to the
castle, I mean to my palace under the hill; but they carried them first to
the bower, where was the chief of their country work, such as the keeping
the goats, the planting the corn, (to; and afterward they carried them to
the habitation of the. two Englishmen. ' Here they were set to work, though
it was not much they had for them to do ; and whether it was by negligence
in guarding them, or that they thought the fellows could not mend them-
selves, I know not, but one of them ran away, and, taking to the woods,
they could never hear of him any more. They had good reason to believe

he got home again soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages who
341
came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their
revels as usual, went off in two days' time. This thought terrified them
exceedingly ; for they concluded, and that 'not without good cause indeed,
that if this fellow came home safe among his comrades, he would certainly
give them an aweourit that there were people in the island, and also how
few and weak they were; for this savage, as observed before, had never
been told, and it was very happy he had not, how many there were, or
where they lived 3 nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their
guns, much less had they shown him any of their other retired places ; such
as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had
made, and the like.

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelligence of
them was, that about two months after this, six canoes of savages, with
about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north side
of the island, where they never used to come before, and landed, about an
hour after sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation
of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As the
chief Spaniard said, had they been all there, the damage would not have
been so much, for not a men of them would have escaped; but the ease
differed now very much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. The two
men had the happiness to discover them about a. league oil', so that it was
above an hour before they landed; and as they landed a mile from their
huts, it was seine time before they could come at them. New, having great
reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first thing they did was to
bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two of the three men whom
they brought with the women (who, it seems, proved very faithful. to them),
to lead them, with their two wives, and whatever they could carry away
with them, to their retired places in the woods, which I have spoken of
above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot, till they heard
farther. In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and
that they had bent their course directly that way, they opened the fences
where the milch cows were kept, and drove them all out; leaving their
goats to straggle in the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might
think they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with them was too
cunning for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went directly
to the place.

When the two poor frightened men had secured their Wives and goods,

they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with the women,
842
and who was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed,
to glvc them the alarm, and desire speedy help, and, in the mean time, they
took their urine, and what ammunition they had, and retreated towards the
place in the wood where their wives were sent ; keeping at 0. distance, yet
so that they might see, if possible, which way the savages took. They had
not gone for, but that from a. rising ground they could see the little army of
their enemies come on directly to their habitat-ion, and, in a moment more,
could see all their huts and household stuff flaming up together, to their
great grief and modification ; for this was a great loss to them, irretricvcble,
indeed, for some time They kept their station for a while, till they found
the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rum-
maging every way, and every place they could think of, in search of prey -
and in particular for the people, of whom now it; plainly appeared they had
intelligence.

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure where
they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people might come that
way, and they might come too many together, thought it proper to make
another retreat about half a mile farther; believing, as it afterwards
happened, that the farther they strolled the fewer would be together.
Their next hall; was at the entrance into a very thick-grown port- of the
woods, and where an old trunk of a. tree stood, which was hollow and very
large; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there
what- might offer. They had not stood there long before two of the savages
appeared running directly that way, as if they already had not-ice where
they stood, and were coming up to 9.th them ; and a little way farther
they cspied three more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all
coming the same way; besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a
distance, running another way; for, in a. word, they ran every way, like
sportsmen heating for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand
and keep their posture, or fly; but, after a very short debate with them-
selves, they eonsidered, that if the savages ranged the country thus before
help came, they might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and then
all would be lost; so they resolved to stand them there, and if they were
too many to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the tree, from
whence they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as
their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were landed, which

was near fifty, were to attack them.
348
Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should
fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the. middle party
by which the two and the five that followed would be separated ; at
length they resolved to let the first two pass by, unless they should spy
them in the tree, and come to attack them. The first two savages confirmed
them also in this resolution, by turning a little from them towards another
part of the wood; but the three, and the five after them, came foru-'nrrl
directly to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they resolved to take them in
a line as they came ; and as they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps
the first shot might hit them all three ; for which purpose the man who was
to fire put three or four small bullets into his piece; and having a. fair
loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim,
without being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the
tree, so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly
saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped from
them ; and they both know him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he
should not escape, though they should both lire: so the other stood ready
with his piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to
have a second. But the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim ; for
as the savages kept near one another, a little behind in a. line, he fired, and
hit two of them directly; the foremost was killed outright, being shot in the
head ; the second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot through the
body, and fell, but was not quite dead; and the third hail a little scratch in
the shoulder, perhaps by the same hall that went through the body of the
second; and being dreadfully frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down
upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than sensible
of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made the sound a thousand
times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling from one side to another,
and the fowls rising from all parts, screaming, and every sort making a
dill'erent noise, according to their kind ; just as it was when I fired the first
gun that perhaps was ever shot 03 in the island.

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the matter
was, came on unconcerned, till they canne to the place where their com-
panions lay in a. condition miserable enough. Here the poor ignorant

creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief,
344
stood altogether over the wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed,
inquiring of him, how he came to he hurt: and who, it is very rational to
believe, told them, that a flash of fire first, and immediately after that
thunder from their gods, had killed those two and wounded him. This, I
say, is rational ; for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no man
near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as
heard of a gun ; neither knew they anything of killing and wounding at a.
distance with fire and bullets: if they had, one might reasonably believe
they would not have stood so unconcerned to view the fate of their fellows,
without. some apprehensions of their own.

Our two men, as they confessed to me, were grieved to be obliged to kill
so many poor creatures, who had no notion of their danger ; yet, having them
all thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece again, resolved to
let fly both together among them ; and singling out, by gmement, which to
aim at, they shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them;
the fifih, tightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest; so
that our men, seeing them all full together, thought they had killed them all.

The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come
boldly out from the tree before they had charged their gums, which was a
wrong step; and they were under some surprise when they came to the
place, and found no less than four of them alive, and of them two very
little hurt, and one not stall This obliged them to fell upon them with the
stocks of their muskets; and first they made sure of the runaway savage,
that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt in
the knee, and put them out of their pain ; then the man that was not hurt
at all, came and kneele'd down to them, with his two hands held up,-and
made piteous incans'to them, by gestures end signs, for his life, but could
not say one word to them that they could understand. However, they
made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a. tree hard by ; and one of the
Englishmen, with a piece _of rope~ynrn, which he had by great chalice in his
pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there they left him ; and with
what speed they could, made after the other two, which were gone before,
fearing they, or any more of them, should find the way to their covered
place in the woods, where their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay.
They came once in sight of the two men, but it was at a. great distance:
however, they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley towards
the sen, quite the coutrarywoy from that which led to their retreat. which
they were afraid of ; and being satisfied with that, they went back to. tl>e~

tree \\ here they left their prisoner, who, 41:; they supposed, was delivered by
his cominades for he "11: gone, and the two pieces of ivope--yam with \\ lnrh
they 11ml hound him, lay just at the foot of the tree.

They wore now in as great concern as before, not knowing what cmuse
to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what numher; so they
resolved to go ztwoy to the place where their wives were, to see if all was
well there, and to make them easy. These were in fright enough. to he sure ;
for though the savages were their own countrymen, yet they were most ter-
ribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of
them. When they 0111110 there, they found the savages had been in the wood,
and very near that place, but had not found it; for it was indeed inacces-
sible, from the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it had
been directed by those that knew it, which these did not; thev found,
therefore, ex erything very safe, only the women in a tenihle frirrht. While
they were heie, they had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come
to than assistance; the other ten, with their servants, and Friday' 5 father,
were.gono in a body to defend their huwcr, and the corn and cattle that
were kept there, in case the savages should have rovcd over to that side of
the country, but they did not spread so far. W'ith the seven Spaniards
came one of the three savagen who, as ] said, were their prisoners fonuerly j.
and with them also came the savage whom the Englishman had left hound
hund and foot at the tieei for it seems they came that way, saw the
slaughtel of the set on men, and unbound the eighth, and brought. him along
with them; where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, as they
had the two others who were left when the third ran. away.

The prisoners now began to he a burden to them; and they were so
afraid of their escaping, Dthat thov were once resolving to kill them all,
believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so for theii own pre--
servation. Howevel, the chief of the Spaniards would not consent to it, but
ordered, for the present, that they should be sent out of the way, to my old
cave in the valley, and he kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them,
and have food for their subsistence, which was done 3 and they were bound
there hand and foot. for that night.

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged, that
they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there ; but taking five
of the Sponiurds,m1d themselves, with four muskets and a pistol among
them, and two stout quarter-strives, away they went in quest of the savages.

And first they came to the tree where the men lay that had been killed;
348
but it was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there, for
they had attempted to carry their dead men away, and had dragged two of
them a good way, but had given it. over. From thence they ndvonccd to the
first rising ground, where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed,
and where they had the mortificntion still to see some of the smoke; but
neither could they here see any of the savages. They then resolved, though
with all possible caution, to go forward towards their mined plantation;
but, a little before they mine thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they
saw plainly the savages all embarked again in their canoes, in order to be
gone. They seemed sorry at first, that there was no way to come at them,
to give them a. parting blow; hut, upon the whole, they were very well
satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being new twice mined, and all their improve-

-ments destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and

assist them with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who were not
yet noted for having the least inclination to do any good, yet as soon as
they heard of it (for they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the
matter till all was over), come and offered their help and assistance, and
did, very friendly, work for several days to restore their habitation, and
make necessaries for them. And thus in a little time they were set upon
their legs again.

About two days after this they had the thither satisfaction of seeing
three of the savages' canoes; come driving on shore, and, at some distance
from them, two drowned men, by which they had reason to believe that
they had met with a storm at, sea, which had orcrsct some of them; for it
had blown very haul the night after they went ofli However, as some
might. inisoarry, so, on the other hand, enough of them escaped to inform
the rest, as well of when; they had done us of Whathad happened to them;
and to whet them on to another enterprise of the some nature, which they,
it seems, resolved to attempt, with sulliciont force to carry all before them ;
for except what the first man had told them of inhabitants, they could say
little ofit of their own knowledge, {or they never saw one man; and the
fellow being killed that had allirmed it. thev had no other witness to confirm
it to them.

It was five or six months after this before they heard any more of the
savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had either forgot their
former bud luck, or given over hopes of better; when, on a sudden, they

were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than eight-and--twenty
347
canoes, full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden
swords, and such like engines of war {and they brought such numbers with
thorn, that, in short, it put all our pimple inlo the utmost consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side of
the island, our men had that night'- to consult and consider what to do, In
the first place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was their only
safety before, and would be much more so now, while the number of their
enemies would he so great, they resolved, first of all, to take down the huts
which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the
old cave; because they supposed the savages would go directly thither, as
soon as it. was day, to play the old game over again, though they did not
new land Within two leagues of it. In the next place they drove away all
the flocks of goats they had at- the old bower, as I called it, which belonged
to the Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little. appearance of inhabitants any--
where as was possible ; and the next morning early they posted themselves,
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men, to wait for their
coming. As they guessed, so it happened: these new invaders, leaving
their canoes at the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore,
directly towards the place, to the. number of two hundred and fifty, as near
as our men could judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but, that which
was worse, they had not arms for all their number. The whole account, it
seems, stood thus: first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen,
old Friday, the three slaves taken with the women, who proved very
faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm
these, they had eleven muslcets, five pistols, three fowling-pieces, five
muskets, or lbwling~pieces, which were taken by me from the mntinous
seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three old halbcrts.

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee ; but they had
each a halhert, or a long staff, like a quarter-etafi', with a. great spike of iron
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also every one of
our men had a hatchet. Two of the women could not be prevailed upon
but they would come into the fight, and they had tows anduarrows, which
the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first notion hamsened,
which I have spoken of, where the. lndians fought with one another; and
the women had hatchets too.

The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, commanded the whole;
and Will Atkins, who, though a. dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a most

daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The savages came forward like
848
lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in
their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful
fellow, with six men, was planted just behind 1). small thicket of bushes, as
an advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them pus-3 by, and then fire
into the middle of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as
nimbly as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind the
Spaniards, where the)r stood, having a thicket of trees before them.

When the savages came on, they run struggling about every way in
heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about fifty of
them pass by him; then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he
orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their muskets with six or
seven bullets apiece, about as big as large pistol bullets How many they
killed or wounded they knew not, but the consternation and surprise was
inexprcssible among the savages ; they were frightened to the lust degree to
hear such a, dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but
see nobody that did it; when, in the middle of their fright, W'ill Atkins
and his other three let fly again among the thickest of them; and in less
than a minute, the first three being loaded again, gave them a; third volley.

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they had
fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body been at hand,
to have poured in their shot continually, the savages had been effectually
routed; for the terror that was among them came principally from this,
that they were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could
see nobody that hurt them. But Will Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat : some of the savages who were at a distance spying
them, came upon them behind; and 'though Atkins and his men fired at
them also, two or three times, nnd killed above twenty, retiring as fast as
they could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, us they did afterwards one Spaniard, and
one of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave was a
most gallant fellow, and fought most- desperately, killing five of them
with his own hand, having no weapon but One of the armed staves and
o hatchet

()ur men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other men
killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, alter _
firing three volleys upon them, retreated also; for their number was so
great, and they were so desperate, that though above fifty of them were

killed, and more than as many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth
at!)'Lmr. AND .invamueue

of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and
it was observed that their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were
made outrageous by their wounds, and fought like medmen.

When our men retreated, they lel't the Spaniard and the Englishman
that were killed behind them: and the savages, when the}r came up to
them, killed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking their arms,
legs, and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages ; but
finding our men were gone, they did not seem inclined to pursue them, but
drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted
twice, in token of their victory; after which, they had the mortifieetion
to see several of their wounded men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon
a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have had them
march and charge again all together at once: but the Spaniard replied--
"Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight,- let them alone
till morning ; all the wounded men will be stiff and sore with their wounds,
and faint with the loss of blood; and so we shall have the liawer to
engage." This advice was good: but 'Will Atkins replied merrily, " That
is true, seignior, and so shall I too; and that is the reason I would go on
while I am warm."~--"V'Vell, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you
have behaved gallantly, and done your part; we will fight for you if you
cannot come on ; but I think it best to stay till morning : " so they waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages in
great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great noise and
hurry among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon
them in the night; especially if they could come to give them but one
volley before they were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity to
do; for one of the Englishmen in whose quarter it was where the fight
hogan, led them round between the woods and the sea-side westward, and
then turning short south, they came so near where the thickest of them
lay, that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in among them,
and did dreadful execution upon them ; in half a minute more, eight others
fired after them, pouring in their small shot in such a quantity, that abun-
dance Were killed and wounded; and all this while they were not able
to see who hurt them, or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then
divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in among them

all together. They had in each body eight persons, that is to say, twenty-
350
two men, and the two women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They
divided the fire--arms equally in each party, as well as the halhcrts and
slaves. They would have hwd the women kept back, but they said they
were resolved to (lie with their husbands. Having thus formed their
little army, they marched out from among the trees, and came up to the
teeth of the enemy, shouting aud'hallooing as loud as they could; the
savages stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the
noise of our men shouting from three quarters together. They would have
fought. if they had seen us; for as soon as we came near enough to be seen,
some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not
dangerously. But our men gave thorn no time, but running up to them,
filed among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends of their
muskets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and laid about them
so well, that, in a WON], they set up a dismal screaming and howling,
flying to save their lives which way soever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally wounded
in the tim fights about one hundred and eighty of them; the rest, being
frightened out of their wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills,
with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could help them to ; and as we
did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together to the
sea-side, where they landed, and where their canoes lay. But their disaster
was not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening
from the sea, so that it was impossible for them to go 011' ; nay, the storm
continuing all night, when the tide came up, their canoes weie most of
them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it
required infinite toil to get them oh"; and some of them were even dashed
to pieces against the beach. Our men, though glad of their victory, yet
got little rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as well as they
could, they resolved to march to that part of the island where the savages
were tied, and see what posture they were in. This necessarily led them
over the place where the fight had been, and where they found several of
the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight
disagreeable enough to generous minds, for as truly great man, though
obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his
misery. However, there was no need to give any orders in this case; for
their own savages, who were their servants, despatohod these poor creatures
with their hutchets.

At length they came in view of tho place where the more miserable
851
remains of the suvnges' army lay, where there appeared about a hundred
still ; their posture was generally Sitting upmr the ground, with their knees
up towards their mouth, {ind the head put between the two hands, leaning
down upon the knees. When our men came within two musketshots of
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to he fired, without ball,
to alarm them ; this he did, that by their countenance he might know what
to expect, whether they were still in heart to fight, or were so heartily
beaten as to be discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly. This
stretagem took ': for as soon as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the
flash of the second, they started up upon their feet in the greatest con-
sternation imaginable; and as our men advanced swiftly towards them,
they all ran screaming and yelling away, with a. kind of howling noise,
which our men did not understand, and had never heard before; and thus
they ran up the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had heen calm, and they
had all gone away to sea ; but they did not then consider that this might
probably have hecn.the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes
as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many and so often, as would
quite desolate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who,
notwithstanding his Wound, kept always with them, proved the best coun--
sellor in this case: his advice was, to take the advantage that olfered, and
step in between them and their hosts, and so deprive them of the capacity
of ever returning any more to plague the island. They consulted long
about this; and some were gainst it for fear of making the matches fly
to the woods and live there desperate, and so they should have them to
hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have.
their plantations continually rifled, all their tmne goats destroyed, and, in
short, he reduced to a. life of continual distress.

Will Atkins told them they hud hatter have to do with a hundred men
than with a hundred nations; that as they must destroy their boats, so
they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In
a. word, he showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came
into it ; so they went to work immediately with the boats, and getting some
dry wood together from a. dead tree, they tried to set seine of them on fire,
but they were so wet that they would not burn ; however, the fire so burned
the upper putt, that it soon made them unfit for use at sea,

When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came

runnin out of the woods, and co ' as near as the could to our men,
8 Y
352
kneeled down and cried, "03, 0a, Waremokoa," and some other wores
of their language, which none of the others understood anything of; but
as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy to understand
they begged to have their boots spared, and that they would be gone, and
never come there again. But our men were now satisfied that they had
no way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, hut ell'ectually
to prevent any of these people from ever going home again: depending
upon this, that if even so much as one of them got back into their country
to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that, letting them know that
they should not have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and
destroyed every one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the sight
of which, the savages raised a. hideous cry in the woods, which our people
heard plain enough, after which they run about the island like distuwtcd
men, so that, in a word, our men did not really know What at first to
do with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider
that while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have
kept a good guard at the some time upon their plantations; for though
it is true, they had driven away their cattle, and the lndians did not find
out their main retreat, I moun my old castle ut the hill, nor the cave in
the valley, yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and pulled
it all to pieces, and all the fences and plunting about it; trod all the
corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe,
and did our .men an inestima'ole damage, though to themselves not one
faithings-worth of service. .

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they
were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down; for
as they were too nimble of foot for our people when they found them
single, so our men durst not go abroad single, for fear of being surrounded
with their numbers. The best was, they had no weapons ; for though they
had hows, they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make any; nor
had they any edge-tool among them. The extremity and distress they
were reduced to was great, and indeed deplorable; but, at the some time,
our men were also brought to very bad circumstances by them, for though
their retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest Spoiled, and what to do, or which way to turn themselves,
they knew not The only refuge they had now, was the stock of outdo
they had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew

there, and the plantation of the three Englishmen, Will Atkins and
353 zzLIFE AND mmmrs

his comrades, were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by
an arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the
temples, so that he never spoke more; and it was very remurkuhlc that
this was the some barbarous fellow that out the poor savage slave
with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have murdered the
Spaniards. '

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine was
at any time, after I first, discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got into
the manner of planting and raising my com, and my tame cattle ; for now
they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which would
devour everything they ouuld come at, yet. could he hardly come at
themselves.

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thm they con-- '
eluded was, that they would, if possible, drive the savages up to the farther

'part of the island, south-west, that if any more came on shore they might

not. find one another; then, that they would daily hunt and harass them,
and kill as many of them as they could come at, till they had reduced their
number; and if they could at last tame them, and bring them to anything,
they would give them corn, and tuich them how to plant, and live upon
their daily labour. In order to this, they so followed them, and so terrified
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at
an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear. So
dreadfully frightened were they that they kept out of sight farther and
famher ; till, at last, our men following them, and almost every day killing
or wounding some of them, the)r kept up in the woods or hollow places so
much, that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of food 5 and
man)' were afterwards found dead in the woods, without any hurt, abso-
lutely starved to death.

When our men found this, it>> made their hearts relent, mad pity moved
them, especiallyr the generous--minded Spaniard governor; and he proposed,
if possible, to take one of them olive, and bring him to understand what
they meant, so for as to be able to act as interpreter, and go among them
and see if they might; be brought to some conditions that might be depended
upon, to save their lives and do us no harm.

It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being weak
and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised and made 9. prisoner.
He was sullen at first, and would neither est not drink; but finding

himself kindly used, and victunls given to him, and no violence ofl'cred
354
him, he at last grew tractable, and came to himself. They often brought old
Friday to talk to him, who always told him how kind the others would
be to them all; that they would not only save their lives, but give them
part of the island to live in, provided they would give satisfaction that they
would keep in their own boxurds, and not come beyond it to injure or
prejudice others; and that they should have corn given them to plant and
make it grow for their bread, and some brood given them for their present.
subsistence: and old Friday bode the fellow go and talk with the rest
of his countrymen, and see what they said to it; assuring them that, if
they did not agree immediately, they should be all destroyed.

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to about
thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have
some Food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen,
well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to the place
where they were. The three lndian slaves carried them a large quantity of
bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live
goats ; and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat
down, ate their provisions very thankfully, and were the most. faithful
fellows to their words that could be thought of; for, except when they
came to beg victuals and directions, they never came out of their bounds;
and there they lived when I came to the island, and I went to see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make hrcrul, breed tame goats,
nud milk them: they wanted nothing but wives in order for them soon
to become a. notion They were confined to a neck of land, surrounded
with high rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the see. before them,
on the south-mt corner of the island. They had [and enough, and it was
very good and fruitful; about a mile and a half broad, and three or- four
miles in length Our men taught- t-hem to make wooden spades, such as
I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four
knives; and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent creatures that
ever were heard of.

After this, the colonycnjoyed a. perfect tranquillity, with respect to the
savages, till I came to revisit thorn, which was about two years after; not
but that, now and then, some canoes of savages came on shore for their
triurnphal, unnatural feasts; but us they were of several net-ions, and
perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or the reason of it, they
did not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they

had, it would have been very hard to have i'orurd them out
355
Thus, I think, I have given a full account; of all that happened to them
till my return, at least that was worth notice. The lndinns were wonder-
fully civilized by them, and they frequently went among them; but they
forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Tndiens coming to them, because
they would not have their settlement hetruyed again. One thing was very
remarkable, viz. that they taught the savages to make wicker-work, or
baskets, but they soon outdid their masters: for they made abundance of
ingenious things in wicker--work, particularly baskets, sieves, hird'cages,
cupboards, Sac. ; as also chairs, stools, beds, couches, being very ingenious at
such work when they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we furnished
them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pickuixes, and all things of that
kind which they could want. With the help of those tools, they were so
very handy that they came at last to build up their huts or houses, very
handsomely, raddliug or working it up like basket-work all the way round.
This piece of ingenuity, although it looked very odd, was an exceeding good
fence, its well against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and our men were
so taken with it, that they got the Indians to come and do the like for
them; so that when I came to see the. two Englislnncn's colonies, they
looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in a hive.

As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, useful,
and sober fellow, he had made himself such a, tent of basket-work us, I
believe, was never seen; it was one hundred and twenty paces round on
the outside, as I measured by my steps ; the walls were as close worked as
a basket, in panels or squams of thirty-two in number, and very strong,
standing about seven feet high; in the middle was another not above
twenty-two paces round, but built- stronger, being octagon in its form, and
in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts; round the top of which
he laid strong pieces, knit together with wooden pins, from which he raised
a. pyramid for a handsome roof of eight. rafters, joined together very well,
though he had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself
too, out of the old iron that I had left there. Indeed, this fellow showed
abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of :
he made him a. forgo, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he
made himself charcoal for his work ; and he formed out of the iron crows a
middling good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made many
Ems, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts, and hinges. But to
return to the house: after he had pimhed the roof of his innermost tent, he

356
worked it up between the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched
that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of
a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry as if it had been
tiled or slated He owned, indeed, that the savages had made the basket-
work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to all relmd this
inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty--two angles to the top
posts of the inner house, being about twenty feet distant, so that there was
a space like a walk within the outer wicker-wall and without the inner,
near twenty feet wide.

The inner place he partitioned onc with the same wicker-work, but much
fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had six rooms on a floor,
and out of every one of these there was a door: first into the entry, or
coming into the main tent, another door into the main tent, and another
door into the space or walk that was round it; so that walk was also
divided into six equal parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to
store up any necessaries which the family had occasion for. These six
spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other apartments the
outer circle had were thus ordered: As soon as you were in at the door of
the outer circle, you had a short passage straight before you to the door of
the inner house; but on either side was 0. wicker partition, and a door in
it, by which you went first into a large room, or storehouse, twenty feet
wide and about thirty feet long, and through that into another not quite so
long; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, air of which
were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and
served as closets or retiring-rooms to the respective chambers of the inner
circle; and four large warehouses, or barns, or what you please to call them,
which went through one another, two on either hand of the passage, that
led through the outer door to the inner tent Such a piece of basket-work,
I believe, was never seen in the world, nor a house or tent so neatly con-
trived, much less so built In this great. bee-hive lived the three families,
that is to say, Will Atkins and his companion; the third was killed, but
his wife remained with three children, and the other two were not at all
backward to give the widow her full share of everything, I mean as to
their corn, milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle
on the shore; so that they all lived well enough; though, it was true, they
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been observed already.

One thing, however, cannot he omitted, viz. that as for religion, I do

not know that there was anything of that kind among them; they often,
357
indeed, put one another in mind that there was a God, by the very common
method of seamen, swearing by His name: nor were their poor ignorant
savage wives much better for having been married to Christians, as we
must call them; for as they knew very little of God themselves, so they
were utterly incapable of entering into any discourse with their wives about
a God, or to talk anything to them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which 1 can say the wives had made
from them was, that they had taught them to speak English pretty well;
and most of their children, who were near twenty in all, were taught to
speak English too, from their first learning to speak, though they at first.
spoke it in u very broken manner, like their mothers. None of these
children were above six years old when I came thither, for it was not much
above seven years since they had fetched t-hese'livc savage ladies over;
they had all children, more or less: the mothers were all a good sort of
well~govorned, quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one
another, mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I cannot call them
husbands), and lacked nothing but to he well instructed in the Christian
religion, and to be legally married, both which were happily brought
about afterwards by my means, or at least in consequence of my coming
among them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and pretty much
of my runagam Englishmen, I must say something of the Spaniards, who
were the main body of the family, and in whose story there are some inci-
dents also remarkable enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances
when they were among the savages. They told me readily that they had
no instances to give of their application or ingenuity in that country; that
they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of people; that even if means
had been put into their hands, yet they had so abandoned themselves to
despair, and were so sunk under the weight of their misfortune, that they
thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a. grave and sensible man,
told me he was convinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the part
of ivise men to give themselves up to their misery, but always to take hold
of the helps which reason offered, as well for present support as for future
deliverance: he told me that grief was the most senseless, insignificant
passion in the World, for that it regarded only things past, which were
generally impossible to be recalled, or to be. remedied, but had no views of
things to come, and had no share in anything that looked like deliverance

3"."
but. rather added to the affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this
he repeated 3. Spanish proverb, which, though I cannot repent in the some
words that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it into an English proverb
of my own, thus :--

l'n trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.

He then ran on in renntrks upon all the little improvements I had made
in my solitude: my unwcoried application, as he called it; and how I had
made a. condition, which in its circumstances was at first much worse than
theirs, a. thousand times more happy than theirs was, even now when they
were all together. He told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a
greater presence of mind, in their distress, than any people that ever he
met with; that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese wore the worst
men in the world to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first step in
dangers, after the common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down under
it, and die, without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape.

I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that they were cast
upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of food, or present sus-
tenance till they could provide for it ; that, it was true, I had this further
disadvantage and discomfort, that I was alone; but then the supplies I had
provident-wily thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving of the
ship on shore, was such. a. help as would have encouraged any creature in
the world to have applied himself as I had done. "Seig'nior," says the
Spaniard, "had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should never have
got. luilf those twp, out of the ship. as you did: nay," says he, " we should
never have found means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have got- the
raft on shore without heat or soil; and how much less should We have done
if any of us had been alone!" Well, I desired him to abate his compli-
ments, and go on with the history of their coming on shore, where they
landed. He told me they unhoppily londed at a. place where there were
people Without provisions; whereas, had they had the common sense to put
off to sea again, and gone to another island a little further, they hud found
provisions, though without people : there being on island that way, as they
had been told, where there were provisions, though no people--that is to
say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and had
filled the island with goats and hogs at several times, where they had bred
in such multitudes, and where turtle and searl'owls were in such plenty,

that they could have been in no want of flesh, though they had found no
359
breed; whereas, here, they were. only sustained with a few roots and herbs,
which they understood not, and which had no substance in them, and which
the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough; and they could treat them no
better, unless they would turn cannibals, and eat men's flesh.

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to eivilize the
savages they were with1 and to teach them rational customs in the ordinary
way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon them, as unjust.
that they, who come there for assistance and support, should attempt to set
up for instructors of those that gave them food; intimating, it seems, that
none should set; up for the instructors of others but those who could live
without them. They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were
driven to ; how sometimes they were many days without any food at. all.
the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived
more indolent, and for that reason were lesg supplied with the necessaries
of life than they had reason to believe others were in the same part of
the world: and yet they found that these savages were less ravenous and
voracious than those who had better supplies of food. Also they added.
they could not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness
the governing providence of God directs the events of things in this world,
which, they said, appeared in their circumstances: for if, pressed by the
hardships they were under, and the barrenness of the country where they
were, they had searched after a better to live in, they had. then been out of
the wuy of the relief that happened to them by my menus.

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived amongst
expectedthem to go out with them into their wars; and, it was true, that-
as they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the disrmter to lose their
ammunition, they could have been serviceable not only to their friends, but
have made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies; but being with-
out powder and shot, and yet in a condition that they could not in reason
decline to go out with their landlords to their wars; so when they come
into the field of battle, they were in a worse condition than the savages
themselves, for they had neither hows nor arrows, nor could they use those
the savages gave them. So they could do nothing but stand still and he
wounded with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their enemy; and
then, indeed, the three halberds they had were of use to them; and they
would often drive a whole little army before them with those hulberds, and
sharyiened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets. But, for all this,

they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger from
360
their arrows, till at last they round the way to make themselvcslorgc targets
of wood which they covered w ith skins of wild beasts, whose names they
knew not, and these covered them from the arrows of the savages: that,
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great danger; and live of
them were once knocked down together with the clubs of the savages,
which 'Was the time when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say,
the Spaniard whom I relieved. At first they thought he had been killed;
but when they afterwards heard he was taken prisoner, they were under
the greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured their
lives to have rescued him

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of their
company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were come to
themselves, all but him whom they thought had been dead ; and then they
made their way with their halherds and pieces, standing close together
in a line, through a body of above a thousand savages, beating down
all that came in their way, got the victory over their enemies, but to their
great sorrow, because it was with the loss of their friend, whom the other
party, finding alive, carried off, with some others, as I gave an account
before. They described, most affectionately, how they were surprised with
joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery, who they
thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, wild men;
and yet, how more and more they were surprised with the account he gave
them of his errand, end that there was a Christian in any place near,
much more one that was able, and had humanity enough to contribute
to their deliverance.

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief
I sent them and at the appearance of loaves of bread--things they had
not seen since their coming to that miserable place ; how often they crossed
it and blessed it as bread sent from Heaven; and what a reviving cordial
it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent for their
supply; and, after ail, they would have told me something of the joy they
were in at the sight of a. boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person
and place from whence all those new comforts come. But- it was impossible
to express it by words, for their excessive joy naturally driving them to
nnbccoming-extravagances, they had no way to describe them, but by
telling me they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to
their passions suitable to the sense that was upon them; that in some '
it worked one way, and in some another ; and that some of them, through

361 3 A
a surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad, and others
immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called ti
my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his hither, and the poor people's
eostusy-when I took them up at son after their ship was on lire; the joy
of the mate of the ship when he found himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when, otter twenty-eight
years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country.
All these things made me more sensible of the rclution of these poor men,
and more affected with it.

Having thus given a View of the state of things as I found them, I
must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and the condition in
which I left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be
troubled no more with the savages, or if they were, they would be able to
cut them off, if they were twice as many as before ; so they had no concern
about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard,
whom I call governor, about their stay in the island: for us I was not
come to carry any of them of)", so it would not be just to carry off some
and leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength
was diminished. On the other hand, I told them I came to estnblish them
there, not to remove them ; and then I let them know that I had brought
with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had been at a. great charge
to supply them with all things necessary, as well for their convenience as
their defence; and that I had such and such particular persons with me,
as well to increase and recruit their number, as by the particular necessary
employments which they wem bred to, being artiflccrs, to assist them in
those things in which at present they wore in want

They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I
delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by one,
if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that. had been
among them, and would shake hands with one another, and engage in a
siriot friendship and union of interest, that so there might be no more
misunderstandings and jealousies.

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, said they
had met with aiiliction enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends; that, for his part, he would live and die with
them, and was so far from designing anything against the Spaniards, that
he owned they had done nothing to him but what his own med humour

made necessary, and what he would have done, and perhaps worse, in their
362
case; and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish
and brutish things he had done to them, and was very willing and desirous
of living in terms of entire friendship and union with them, and would
do anything that lay in his power to convince them of it; and as for going
to England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty years. .

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and excluded
Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct, its they had let
me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity they were under to
do so; but that Will Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with the savages, and on several occasions since, and had
showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of
them all, that they had lorgotten all that was passed, and thought he
merited as much to he trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries
as any of them; that they had testified their satisfaction in him, by
committing the command to him next to the governor himself; and as
they had entire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they acknow-
ledged they had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest
men could merit to be valued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced
the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would never have any
interest separate from one another.

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we appointed
the next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast.
I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our
dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. We brought
on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of the
ship's provisions, with our punchhowl,_ and materials to fill it; and, in
particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of
English beer; things that neither the Spaniards nor the English had
tasted for many years, and which it may be supposed they were very
glad of. The Spaniards added to our least five whole kids, which the
cooks roasted; and three of them' were sent, covered up close, on board
the ship to the semen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on share,
as we did with their suit meat from on board.

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought my
cargo of goods; wherein, that there might be no dispute about dividing, 1
showed them that there was a suficiency for them all, desiring that they
might all take an equal quantity, when made up, of the goods that were

for wearing. As; first 1 distributed linen sufficient to make every one
353
of them four shirts, and, at the Spaniaml's request, afterwards made them
up six; these were exceeding comfortable to them, having been what they
had long since forgotthe use of, or when it was to wear them. I allotted
the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make every one
a-light coat, like a frock, which I judged fittest for the host of the season,
cool and loose; and ordered that whenever the)r decayed, they should
make more, as they thought fit; the like for pumps, shoes, stockings,
hats, die. I cannot express what pleasure sat upon the eountonnnces of
all these poor men, when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them. They told me I was a father to them ;
and thut having such a correspondent as I was in so remote a part of the
world, it would make them forget that they were left in a. desolate place;
and they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place without my
consent

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, par-
ticularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them most,
necessnrg,r people; but, above all, my general artificer, than whom they
could not name anything that was more useful to them; and the tailor,
to show his concern for them, went to work immediately, and, with my
leave, made them every one a shirt, the first thing he did; and, what was
still more, he taught the women not onlyhow to sew and stitch, and use the
needle, but made them assist- to make the shirts for their husbands, and for
all the rest As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they
were; for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made
clever convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and
everything they wanted of that kind. But to let them see how nature
made urtificem at first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins' basket~
house, as I called it; and they both owned they never saw an instance of
such natural ingenuity before, nor anything so regular and so handily built,
at least of its kind ; and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a. good
while, turning about to me, " I am sure," says he, " that man has no need
of us ; you need do nothing but give him tools."

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man
a. digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows or plough;
and to every separate place a pickuxe, a crow, a broad axe, and a. saw;
always appointing, that as often as any were broken or worn out, they
should be supplied without grudging, out of the general stores that I left
behind. Neils, staples, hinges. lmnnners, Chisels, knives: scissors, and all

so;
sorts of iron-work, they had without reserve, as they required ; for no man
would take more than he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste
or spoil them on any account whatever; and for the use of the smith, 1 left
two tons of unwrought iron for a supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such,
even to profusion, that; they could not but rejoice at them; for now they
could march us I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if there
was occasion; and Were able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but
some little advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, if they
had occasion. .

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved to
death, and the maid also; she was a sober, well educated, religious young
woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one gave her a good word;
she had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the ship
but herself, but she bore it with patience After a while, seeing things so
well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and con-
sidering that they had neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies,
or reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to me, and desired
I would give them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among my
family, as they called it. I agreed to this readily ; and they had a little
plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or houses set
up, surrounded with a busketwork, palisadoecl like Atkins', adjoining to
his plantation. Their tents were contrived so that they had each of them
a. room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent like a. great storehouse, to lay
their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the other two English-
men removed their habitation to the some place; and so the island was
divided into three colonies, and no more, viz. the Spaniards, with old
Friday and the first servants, at my old habitation under the hill, which
was, in a word, the capital city, and where they had so enlarged and
extended their works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that
they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was there
such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world; for
I verily believe that a thousand men might have ranged the island a month,
and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on purpose
for it, they would not have found it Indeed, the trees stood so thick and
so close, and grew so fast woven one into another, that nothing but cutting

'them down first could discover the place, except the only two narrow

entrances where they went in and out could be found, which was not very
366
easy; one of them was close down at the water's edge, on the side of the
creek, and it; was afterwards above two hundred yards to the place: and
the other was up a ladder at twice, as I have already described it; and
they had also 11. large wood, thickly planted, on the top of the hill,
containing above an more, which grew space, and concealed the place from
all discovery there, with only one narrow place between two trees, not
easily to be discovered, to enter on that. side.

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four
families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their wives
and children; three savages that were slaves, the widow and the children
of the Englishman that was killed, the young man and the maid, and,
by the way, we made a wife of her before we went away, There were
besides the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me for
them: also the smith, who was a very necessary men to them, especially
as a gnnsmith, to take care of their arms; and my other man, whom I
called J uelt-of--all-tmdes, who was in himself as good almost as twenty
men ; for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow,
and before I went away we married him to the honest maid that come with
the youth in the ship I mentioned before.

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say something
of the French ecclesiastie that I had brought with me out of the ship's
crew whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a Roman, and
perhaps it may give offence to some hereafter, if I leave anything extre-
ordinary npon record of a man whom, before I begin, I must (to set him
out. in just colours) represent in terms very much to his disadvantage, in
the aeeonnL of Protestants; as, first, that he was a l'apist; secondly, a
Popish priest; and, thirdly, a French Popish priest. But justice demands
of me to give him a. due character; and I must say, he was a grove, sober,
pious, and most religious person; exact in his life, extensive in his charity,
and exemplary in almost everything he did. What then can any one say
against being very sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding
his profession? though it may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the
opinion of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken.

The first hour that I begun to converse with him after he had agreed to i
go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his
wnversation; and he first began with me about. religion in the most
obliging manner imaginable "Sir," says he, "you have not only under '

God (and at that he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have
866
admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging civility.
have taken me into your family, giving me an opportunity of free cou-
versution Now, sir, you see by my habit what my profession is, and l
guess by your nation what yours is 5 I may think it is my duty, and
doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring
all the souls I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the
hitholic doctrine; but as I am here under your permission, and in you
family, I am bound in justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and
good manners, to be under your government; and therefore I shall not,
without. your leave, enter into any debate on the points of religion in which
we may not agree, further than you shall give me leave."

I told him his carriage was so modest that 1 could not but acknowledge
it; that it was true we were such people as they call heretics, but that he
was not the first Catholic I had convexsed with, without falling into
inconveniences, or carrying the questions to any height in debate; that
he should not find himself the worse used for being of a different opinion
from us, and if we (lid not converse without any dislike on either side, it
should be his fault, not mire.

He replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily separated
from disputes; that it was not his business to cap principles with every
man he conversed with ; and that he rather desired me to conveine with
him as a gentleman than as n religionist; and that, if I would give him
leave at any time to discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily
comply with it, and that he did not doubt but 1 would allow him also to
defend his own opinions as well as he could; but that, without my leave,
he would not break in upon me with any such thing. He told me further,
that he would not cease to do all that became him, in his oliice as u priest,
as well as a private Christian, to procure the good of the ship. and the safety
of all that was in her; and though, perhaps, we would not join with him,
and he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he
_ would do upon all occasions In this manner we eonversed; and us he
was of the most obliging, gentlemanlikc, behaviour, so he was, if I may be
allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, us I believe, of great learning.

He gave me a most diverting account. of his life, and of the many extra-
ordinary events of it; of many adventures which hail befallen him in the
few yours that he had been abroad in the world; and particularly it was
Vvery remarkable, that in the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the

misfortune to be live times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the
367
place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed. That his
first intent was to have gone to Mortinico, and that he Went on board 0. ship
hound thither at St. Mule; but, being forced into Lisbon by burl weather,
the ship received some damage by running aground in the mouth of the
river Tagus, and was obliged to unload her cargo there; but finding a
Portuguese ship there bound to the Madeirns, and ready to sail, and sup--
posing he should easily meet with a vessel there bound to Martinico, he
went on board, in order to sail to the Madeims; but the master of the
Portuguese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, had been out of his
reckoning, and they drove to Fuyal; where, however, he happened to find
a. very good market for his cargo, which was com, and therefore resolved
not to,go to the )[ndeiras but to load salt at the Isle of May, and to go
away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in this exigenee but to go with
the ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far (LS the Bnnhs [so they cull the
place where they cuteh the fish), where meeting with 3 anch ship bound
from France to Quebec, and from thence to Marfinico, to carry provisions,
he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first design ; but
when he came to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel pro-
ceeded no further; so the next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the
ship that was burned when we took them up at sea, and then shipped with
us for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one voyage, besides what i
shall have occasion to mention further of him.

But I shall not make digression into other men's stories, which have no
relation to my own ; so T return to what concerns our affairs in the island.
lie came to me one morning (for he lodged among us all the while we were
upon the island), and it happened to he just when I was going to visit the
l'lnglishmen's colony, at the furthest port of the island; I say, he come to
me, and told me, with a. very grove countenance, that he hud for two or
three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with me, which he
hoped would not he displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some
measure correspond with my general design, which was, the prosperity of
my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet thought.
it was, in the way of God's blessing.

I looked it little surprised at the last part of his discourse, and turning
a. little short, " How, sir," said I, " can it be said that we are not in the way
of God's blessing, other such visible assistances and deliver-uncles as we haw

seen here, and of which I have given you a large uecount?"----" If you had
388
pleased, sir," said he, with a world of modesty, and yet great readiness, " to
have heard me, you would have found no room to have been displeased,
much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest that you have not
had wonderful assistanecs and deliverances; and I hope, on your behalf,
that you are in the way of God's blessing, and your design is exceeding
good, and will prosper. But, sir, though it were more so than is even
possible to you, yet there may be some among you that are not equally
right in their actions: and you know, that in the story of the children of
Israel, one Achan in the camp removed (lod's blessing from them, and
turned his hand so against them, that six-und-thirt-y of them, though not
concerned in the crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the
weight of that punishment."

I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him his inference
was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and was really so
religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him,
and begged him to go on; and, in the meantime, because it seemed that
what we had both in say might take up some time, I told him I was going
to the Englishnien's plantations, and asked him to go with me, and we
might discourse of it by the Way. He told me he would the more willingly
wait on me thither, because there partly the thing was acted which he
desired to spank to me about; so we walked amend I pressed him to be
frce and plain with me in what he had to say.

"Why, then, sir," says he, "be pleased to give me leave to lay down a
few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to soy, that we may not
differ in the general plinciples, though we may he of some differing opinions
in the practice of particulars. First, sir, though we dill'er in some of the
doctrinal articles of religion (and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in
the case before us, as I shall show afterwards), yet there are some general
principles in which we both agree --thot there is a God; and that this God
having given us some stated general rules for our service and obedience, we
ought not willingly and knowingly to offend Him, either by neglecting lo
do what He has commanded, or by doing what He has expressly forbidden.
And let our different religions be what they will, this general principle is
readily owned by us all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow
presumptuous shining against His command ; and every good Christian will
be afi'ecttionately concerned to prevent any that are. under his care living
in a. total neglect of God and His commands. It is not your men being

Pmtesmnta. whatever my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from
369 3 B
being concerned for their souls, and from endeavouring. if it lies before me,
that they should live in as little distance from enmity with their Maker as
possible, especially if you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit."

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at: and told him 1 granted all he
had said, and thanked him that he would so for concern himself for us:
and begged he would explain the particulars of what he had observed, thui;
like Joshua, to take his own parable, I might put away the acoursed thing
from us.

"Why, then, sir," says he, "I will take the liberty you give me; and
there are three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the way of God's
blessing upon your endeavours hero, and which I should rejoice, for your
sake and their own, to see removed, And, sir, I promise myself that you
will fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name them; especially
because I shall convince you that every one of them may, with great ease,
and very much to your satisfaction, be remedied First, sir," says he, " you
have here four Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the
savages, and have taken them as their wives, and have had many children
by them all, and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner,
as the laws of God and man require. To this, sir, I know, you will object
that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind to perform the ceremony;
nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and
have it signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the Spaniard
governor has told you, I mean of the agreement that he obliged them to
make when they tool: those women, viz that they should choose them out
by consent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of
a. marriage, no agreement with the women, as wives, but only an agreement
among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. But, sir, the emence of
the sacrament. of matrimony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man and
wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the contract to
compel the man and woman, at- all times, to own and acknowledge each
other; obliging the man to abstain from all other Women, to engage in no
other contract while these subsist; and, on all occasions, as ability allows,
to provide honestly for them and their children ; and to oblige the women
to the some or like conditions, on their side. Now, sir," says he, "these
men may, when they please, or when occasion presents, abandon these
women, disown their children, leave them to perish, and take other women,

and marry them while these are living;" and here he added, with some
370
warmth, "How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty? And how
shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, however good in
themselves, and however sincere in your design, while these men, who at
present are your subjects, under your absolute government and dominion,
are allowed by yen to live in open adultery ?" '

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with
the couvinom arguments he supported it with; but I thmight to have
got off myyoung priest by telling him that all that part was done
when I was not there: and that they had lived so many years with them
now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy; nothing could be done
in it now. '

"Sir," says he, "asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right in
this, that, it :10ng done in your absence, you could not be charged with
that part of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you
are not, therefore, under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an
end to it. You should legally and effectually marry them ; and as, sir, my
way of marrying may not be easy to reconcile them to, though it will be
effectual, even by your own laws, so your way may he as well before God,
and as valid among men. I mean by a written contract, signed by both
man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws of
Europe would decree to he Valid."

I was amazed to see so moo}; lil'lle piety, and so much sincerity of zeal,
besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own party or
church, and such true warmth for preserving people that he had no
knowledge of or relation to, from transgressing the laws of God. But
recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a written contract, which
I knew he would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and told him I
granted all that he had said to be just, and on his part very kind ; that I
would discourse. with the men upon the point now, when 1 came to them;
and I knew no reason why they should sample to let him marry them all,
which I knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid
in England as if they were married by one of our own clergymon.

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he
had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his debtor for the first,
and thanked him heartily for it He told me he would use the some
freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped I would take it as well;
and this was, that, notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he
called them, had lived with these women almost seven years, had taught
. them to speak English, and even to read it, and that they were, as he
perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and capable of instruction,
yet they had not, to this hour, taught them anything of the Christian
religion--mo, not so much as to lrnow there was u God, or a. worship, or in
what manner God was to he served, or that. their own idolatry, and
worshipping the)r knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said,
was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly call them to
account for, and perhaps at last take the work out of their hands. He
spoke this very affectionately and warmly.

" I am persuaded," says he, " had those men lived in the savage country
whence their wives came, the sav'ges would have taken more pains to have
brought them to be idolators, and to worship the devil, than any of these
men, so far as I can see, have taken with them to touch the knowledge of
the true God. Now, sir," said he, " though I do nothcknowledge your
religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad to see the devil's servants and
the subjects of his kingdom taught to know the general principles of the
Christian religion; that they might, at least, hear of God and o Redeemer,
and of the resurrection, and of a future state--things which we all believe;
that they might, at least, be so much neurcr coming into the bosom of the
true church than they are now, in the public profession of idolatry and
devil-worship." .

I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms, and embraced him
eagerly. "How far," said I to him, "have I been from understanding the
most essential part of a Christian, viz, to love the interest of the Christian
church, and the good of other men's souls: I scarce have known what
belongs to the being a. Christian."--"0h, sir! do not say so," replied he;
" this thing is not your feult."--" No," said I ; " but why did I never lay it.
to heart as well as you ? "---" It is not too late yet," said he; "he not too
forward to condemn yourself."----" But what can be. done now?" said I:
"you see I am going uwoy."--->>" Will you give me leave to talk with these
poor men about it? "--" Yes, with all my hear ," said I: " and will oblige
them to give heed to what you say too."----" As to that," said he, " we must
leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them,
encourage them, and instruct them; and if you give me leave, and God his
blessing, 1 do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home
to the great cirele of Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all
embrace, and that even while you stay here." Upon this I said, "I shall

not only give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it."
372
I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame.
" Why, really," says he, " it is of the some nature. It is about your poor
savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim,
air, that is, or ought to be received among all Christians, of what church or
pretended church soever, that the Christian knowledge ou'ght to be pro-
pagated by all possible means, and on all possible occasions. ID is on this
principle that our church sends missionaries into l'ersio, India, and China ;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most
hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence amongst murderers
and barbarians to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring
them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an
opportunity here to have six or soven-and~thirty poor savages brought over
from a state of idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer,
that I wonder how you can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is
really worth the expense of a man's whole life."

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say. I had
here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before me. As
for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this in my heart
before, and I believe I should not have thought of it ; for I looked upon
these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we not had any work for
them to do, we would have used as such, or would have been glad to have
transported them to any other part of the world; for our business was to
get rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent
to any comitxy, so they had never seen their own. I was confounded at
his discourse, and knew not what answer to make him.

He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion--"Sir," says he, "I shall
be very sorry if what I have said gives you any oflenec."--" No, no," said
I, "I run ofl'ended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly confounded,
not only to think that I should never take any notice of this before, but with
reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," said I,
"what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies in a ship
freightcd by merchants, and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of
injustice to detain their ship here. the men lying all this while at victuals
and wages on the owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed
twelve days here, and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per
diem denim-rage ; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more,
and I have been here thirteen already; so that I am perfectly unable

to engage in this work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here
373
signin; in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of
her voyage, I should be just. in the same condition that I was left in here
at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered." He owned
the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage ; but laid it home upon
my conscience, whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not
worth venturing all I had in the world for. I was not so sensible of that
as he was. I replied to him thus: "Why, sir, it is a valuable thing,
indeed, to be an instrument in God's hand to convert thirty-seven houtheus
.to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are an coclesiastic, and are given
over to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall into the way of your pro-
fession; how is it, then, that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake
it than press me to do it? "

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and putting
me to a. full stop, made me a very low how. "I most heaitily thank God
and you, sir," said he, " for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work ;
and if you think yourself discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it,
I will most madily do it, and think it a. happy reward for all the hazards
and difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with,
that I our dropped at last into so glorious a. work."

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to me; his
eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his colour came and went ; in a
word, he was fired with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I
paused a considerable. while before I could tell what to say to him; for I
was really surprised to find a man of such sincerity, and who seemed
possessed of a zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men. But after I had
considered it awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he
would venture, on the single consideration of an attempt to convu-t. thoso
poor people, to be locked up in an Implanted island for perhaps his life, and
at last might not know whether he should he sihlo to do them good or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a. venture? " Pray,
sir," said he, " what do you think I consented to go in your ship to the
East Indies for?"--i" Nay," said I, " that I know not, unless it was to
preach to the Indians."--" Doubtless it was," said he; "and do you think,
if I can convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is
not worth my time, though I should never be fetched off the island again?
---nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than my life
is, or the life of twenty more of the some profession? Yes, sir," says he,

"I would give God thanks all my days, if I could be made the happy
374m m mums I'm: (mm-mums or 1:13 INDIANI.

instrument of saving the souls of those poor men, though I were never to
get my foot oll' this island, or see my native country any more, But since
you will honour me with putting me into this work, for which I will pray
for you all the days of my life, I have one humble petition to you besides"
---"What is that?" said 1--" \Vhy," says he, " it is, that you will leave
your man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me;

for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they to me."
376
I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not
think of parting with him, and that for many reasons: he had been the
companion of my travels; he was not only faithful to me, but sincerely
affectionate to the. last degree; and I. had resolved to do something con-
siderable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I
knew that, as I had bred Friday up to he a Protestant, it would quite
confound him to bring him to embrace another religion; and he would
never, while his eyes were open, believe that his old master was a heretic,
and would be damned; and this might in the end ruin the poor fellow's
principles, and so turn him back again to his first idolatry. However,
a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it was this: I told him
I could not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever, though a work that to him was of more value than his life, ought
to he of much more value than the keeping or parting with a. servant. But,
on the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no means agree to
part with me; and I could not force him to it without his consent, without
manifest injustice; because I had promised I would never send him away,
and he had promised and engaged to me that he would never leave me,
unless I sent him away. .

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational access to
these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of their language.
nor they one of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him Friday's father
had learned Spanish, which I found he also understood, and he should serve
him as an interpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing could
persuade him but he would stay and endeavour to convert them; but
Providence gave another veryr happy turn to all this.

I come back now to the first part of his objections When we came to
the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after some account given
them of what I had done for them, viz. what necessary things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed, which they were very
sensible of, and very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous
life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had
taken of it ; and arguing how unchristisn and irreligious a life it was, 1' first
asked them if they were married men or bachelors? They soon explained
their condition to me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and tho
other three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what con-
science they could take these women, and call them their wives, and have

so many children by them, and not he lawfully married to them? They all
376
gave me the answer I expected, viz. that there was nobody to marry them;
that they agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives, and to
maintain them and own them as their wives ; and they thought, as things
stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had been married
by a person, and with all the formalities in the world.

I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, and
were bmmd in conscience to keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of
men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women and children here-
after; end that their wives, being poor desolate women, fiiendless and
moneyless, would have no way to help themselves. I therefore told them
that, unless I was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for
them, but would take care that what I did should be for the women and.
children without them ; and that, unless they would give me some assurances
that they would marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they
should continue together as man and wife; for that it was both scandalous
to men and offensive to God, who they could not think would bless them if
they went on thus.

All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially Will
Atkins, who now seemed to Speak for the rest, that they loved their wives
as well as if they had been born in their own native country, and would
not leave them on any account whatever; and they did verily believe that
their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their
skill, as much for them and for their children, as any women could possibly '
do ; and they would not part with them on any account. Will Atkins, for
his own particular, added, that if any man would take him away, and offer
to carry him home to England, and make him captain of the best man-oil
war in the navy, he would not go with him, if he might not carry his wife
and children with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would
be married to her new with all his heart.

This was just as I would have it. The priest was not with me at that
moment, but was not far off : so to try him further, I told him I had a
clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him married next
morning, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as
for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it,
aud was glad I had a minister with me, and he believed they would be all
willing also. I then told him that my friend, the minister, was a French-
man, and could not speak English, but I would (wt the clerk between them.
He never so much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant

377 3 c
which was, indeed, what I was afmid of. We then parted, and I went back
to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his companions.- I
desired the French gentleman not to s.1.y anything to them 'till the business
was thoroughly ripe -, and I told him what answer the men had given me.

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me, and told me they
had been considering what I had said; that they were glad to hear I had u.
clergyman in my company, and they were very willing to give me the
satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married as soon as I pleased ; for
they were for from desiring to part with their wives, and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest when they chose them. So I appointed
them to meet me the. next morning ; and, in the mean time, they should let
their wives know the meaning of the marriage law; and that it was not
only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not
forsake them, whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing, and
were very well satisfied with' it, as, indeed, they had reason to be: so they
failed not to attend altogether at my apartment next morning, where I
brought out my clergyman; end though he had not on a minister's gown,
after the manner of England, or the habit. of a priest, after the manner of
France, yet having a black rest something like. u cassock, with a sash round
it, he did not look very unlike a. minister; and as for his language, I was
his interpreter. But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the
' samples he made of marrying the women, because they were not baptized
and professed Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his person ;
and there was no need, after that, to inquire whether he was a clergyman or
not>>. Indeed, I was afraid his soruplcs would have been carried so far as
that he would not have married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was
able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and
at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talked with the
men and the women too ; end though at first I was a little backward to it,
yet at last I agreed to it with at good will, perceiving the sincerity of his
design.

When he came to them, he let- them know that I had acquainted him
with their circumstances, and with the present design; that he was very
willing to perform that part of his function, and marry them, as I had
desired; but that before he could do it, he must take the liberty to talk
with them. He told them, that in the sight of all indifl'erent men, and in-

the sense of the laws of society, they had lived all this while in a state of
378
sin; and that it was true, that nothing but the consenting to marry, or
ell'ect'ually separating them from one another, could now put an end to it,
but there was a diliiculty in it too, with respect to the laws of Christian
matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, that of marrying one
that is a professed Christian to a savage, an idolntor, and a, heathen,----une
that is not baptized ; and yet that he did not see that there was time left to
endeavour to persuade the women to be baptized, or to profess'the name of
Christ, whom they had, he doubled, heard nothing of, and without which
they could not be baptized He told them he doubted they were but
indifferent Christ-inns themselves; that they had but little knowledge of
God or of his ways, and therefore he could not expect that they had said
much to their wives on that head yet; but. that unless they would promise
him to use their endeavours with their wives to persuade them to become
Christians, and would, as well as they could, instruct them in the know-
ledge and belief of God that made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that
redeemed them, he could not marry them ; for he would have no hand in
joining Christians with savages, nor was it consistent. with the principles of
the Christian religion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very faithfully
to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I could ; only sometimes
adding something of my own, to convince them how just it was, and that
I was of -his mind; and I always very faithfully distinguished between
what I said from myself, and what were the clergyman's words. They told
me it was very true what the gentleman said, that they were very indifi'erent
Christians themselves, and that; they had never talked to their wives about
religion. " Lord, sir," says Will Atkins, "how should we teach them
religion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, sir," said he,
" should we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it
would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves?
And if we should tell them that we believe all the things we Speak of to
them, such as of good people going to heaven, and wicked people to the
devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that believe all
this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are? Why, sir, 'tia enough
to give them a. surfeit of religion at first hearing; folks must have some
religion themselves before they begin to teach other people."--" Will
Atkins," said I to him, "' though I am afraid that what you say has too
much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife she is in the wrong ; that
there is a God, and a religion better than her own; that her gods are idols ;
379
that they can neither hour not speak; that there is a. great Being that made
all things, and that can destroy all that he has made; that he rewards the
good and punishes the bad; and that we are to be judged by him at last
for all we do here? You are not so ignorant, but even nature itself will
teach you that all this is true; and I am satisfied you know it all to be
true, and believe it yourself."----"'l'hat is true, sir," said Atkins; " but with
what face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell me
immediately it cannot be true 1' "----"Not true 3" said 1 3 "what. do you mean
by that?"----"VVhy, sir," said he, "she will tell me it cannot be true that
this God I shall tell her of can he just, or can punish or reward, since I um
not punished and sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked creature
as she knows I have been, even to her, and to everybody else -, and that I
should he suffered to live, that have been always acting so contrar)r to whet
I must tell her is good, and to what I ought. to have done."---" My, truly,
Atkins," said I, " I am afraid thou speakest too much truth 3 " and with that
I informed the clerg-'man of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to
know. " Oh," said the priest, " tell him there is one thing will make him
the best minister in the world to his wife, and that is, repentance ; for none
teach repentance like true pcnitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and
then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct his wife; he will
then be able to tell her that there is not only a. God, and that he is the just
rcwarder of good and evil, but that he is a merciful being, and with infinite
goodness and long-sufiering forbenrs to punish those that offend ; waiting to
be gracious, and willing not the death of h sinner, but rather that he should
return and live; and even reserves damnation to the general day of retri-
bution ; that it is a clear evidence or God and of a, future state, that
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment,
till they come into another world ; and this will lead him to touch his wife
the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment. Let him but
repent himself, he will he. an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife"
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, and,
as we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it;
when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an end--"l know all
this, master," says he, " and a great deal more; but I have not the impu-
dence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience know, and my
wife will he an undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived as if I
had never heard of a God or future state, or anythig about it ; and. to talk

of my repenting, alas I (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could
sso
see that the tears stood in his eyes) 't-is past all that with me"---"Past it,
Atkins?" said 1 : " what dost thou mean by that? "---" I know well enough-
whab I mean," says he ; " I mean 'tis too late, and that is too true."

I told the clerQ-'man, word for word, what he said, and this all'ectionate
man could not refrain from tears ; but, recovering himself, said to me,
"Ask him but one quest-ion: Is he easy that it is too late; or is he
troubled, and wishes it were not so 2 " I put the question fairly to Atkins ;
and he answered, with a great deal of passion, "How could any man be
easy in a condition that must certainly end in eternal destruction? that he
was far from being easy; but that, on the contrary, he believed it would
one time or other ruin him."--" What do you mean by that?" said I.
" Why," he said, "he believed he should one time or other out his throat, to
put an end to the terror of it."

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face, when I
told him all this; but turning quick to me, upon it, says, "If that be his
case, we may assure him it is not too late ; Christ will give him repentance
But prey," says he, "explain this to him ; that as no man is saved but by
Christ, and the merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him, how
can it be too late for any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able
to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there
may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God
may refuse to hear, but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy ; and
we, that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all times,
in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerelv reoent : so that it is
never too late to repent."

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness; but it
seemed as if he turned oil" the discoume to the rest, for he said to me, he
would go and have some talk with his wife; so he went out a while, and
we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to
matters of religion, as much as 1 was when I went rambling away from my
father 3 yet there were none of them backward to hear what had been said;
and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with their wives
about it, and do their endra ours to persuade them to turn Christians.

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they gave,
but said nothing a good while ; but at last shaking his head, " We that are
Christ's servants," says he, " can go no further than to exhort and instruct:
and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis

all we can do; we are bound to accept their good words ; but believe me,
331
sir." said he, " whatever you may have known of the life of that man you
call Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere convert among them: I
will not despair of the rest; but that man is oppxn'ently struck \11th the
sense of his past life, and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to
his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it: for attempting to teach
others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. If that poor
Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, he will
assuredlv talk himself into a thorough convert, make himself a penitent,
and who knows what. may follow. "'

Upon this discourse, however and their promising, as above to endeavour
to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married the11tl1er two
couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. After this,
my clergyman, waiting awhile, was curious to know where Atkins was gone,
and turning to me, said, " I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth
here, and look: I dare say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other
talking sen'ously to his wife, Iand teaching her alrend_1r something of
religion" I began to be of the same mind ; so we went out together, and
I enriied him a way which none knew but my self, and where the trees were
so very thick that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and
far harder to see in than to see out: when, coming to the edge of the wood.
I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the shade of a bush, ver1
eager in discourse: I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me and
then having showed him where they were, we stood and looked very stondilv
at them a good while. We ohsewed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to e1 ery quarter of the heavens, and then down to the
earth, then out to the see, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the
trees. "Now," says the clergyman, " you see my words are made good, the
man preaches to her , mark him now, he is telling her that our God has
made him, her and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &o."

--"I believe he is," said 1. Immediately, we perceived Will Atkins sta1t
upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift. up both his hands. We
supposed he said something, but we could not hear him; it was too far for
that. He did not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again; We perceived then the
woman very attentive, but. whether she said anything to him we could
not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees. I could see the tears
run plentifully down my olergyman's cheeks, and I could hardly forhem

myself; but it was a great nfllietion to us both that we were not 110111
882
enough to hear anything that passed between them Well, however, we
could come no nearer for fear of disturbing them : so we resolved to see an
end of this pieee of still c'onversation, and it spoke loud enough to us
without the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her,
and talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see him
embrace her most passionately; another time we saw him take out his
handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind of
transport very unusual; and alter several of these things, we saw him on
a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her up, when
immediately leading her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down
together, and continued so about two minutes.

My friend could bear it no lower, but cries out aloud, " St, Paul! St.
Paul ! behold, he prayeth." I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore
I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might see an end of
the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most affecting that ever I
saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself for a while, but was in such
ruptures, to think that the poor heathen woman was become a Christian,
that he was not able to contain himself ; he wept several times, then throw-
ing up his hands and crossing his breast, said over several things ejaculatory,
and by the way of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the
success of our endeavours. Some he spoke softly, and I could not well hear
others; some things he said in Latin, some in French; then two or three
times the tears would interrupt him, that he could not speak at all ; but I
begged that he would contain himself, and let us more narrowly and fully
observe what was before us, which he did for a time, the scene not being near
ended yet ; for after the poor man and his wife were risen again from their
knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we observed her
motion, that she treasgreatly ail'ected with what he said, by her frequently
lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such other postures
as express the greatest seriousness and attention ; this continued about half
a quarter of an hour, and then they walked away, so we could see no more
of them in that situation.

I took this interval to say to the clergyman, first, that I was glad to see
the particulars we had both been witnesses to; that, though I was hard
enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was all very
sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however ignorant they might both
be, and I hoped such a beginning would yet have a more happy end: "But,

my friend," added I, "will you give me leave ix) start one difficulty here?
883
I cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate concern
which you show for the turning of the poor people from their Paganism to
the Christian religion; but how does this comfort you, while these people
are, in your account, out of the pole of the Catholic church, without which
you believe there is no salvation? so that you esteem these but heretics, as
effectually lost as the Pagans themselves."

To this he answered, with abundance of cendour, thus: "Sir, I am a
Catholic of the Roman church, and a priest of the order of St. Benedict,
and I embrace all the principles of the Roman faith ; but yet, if you will
believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to
my circumstances and your civilities; I sny, nevertheless, I do not look
upon you, who call yourselves reformed, without some charity. I dare not
say (though I" know it is our opinion in general) that you cannot be saved;
I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far as think that he cannot
receive you into the bosom of his church, in a manner to us unperccivablc;
end I hope you have the same charity for us : I pray daily for your being
all restored to Christ's church, by whatsoever method He, who is all-wise,
is pleased to direct. In the mean time, surely you will allow it consists
with me, as a Roman, to distinguish far. between a Protestant and a Pagan ;
between one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not
think is according to the true faith, and a savage or a barbarian, that knows
no God, no Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the pole of the
Catholic church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it than those
who know nothing of God or of his church : and I rejoice, therefore, when
I see this poor man, who, you say, has been a profligute, and almost a mur-
derer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did, though
not fully enlightened; believing that God, from whom every such work
proceeds, will sensibly touch his heart, and bring him to the further
knowledge of that truth in his own time; and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant-savage, his wife, I can never
believe that he shall be cast away himself And have I not reason, then,
to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though
they may not be brought quite home into the bosom of the Catholic church
just at the time when I desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to
perfect his work in his own time, and in his own way? Certainly, I would
rejoice if all the savages in America were brought, like this poor woman, to
prey to God, though they Were all to be Protestants at first, rather than

they should continue Pagans or Heathens; firmly believing, that He that
384
had bestowed the first light on them would farther illuminate them with a
beam of his heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of his church,
when he should see good. "

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious Papist as
much as I was oppressed by the power of his reasoning; and it presently
occurred to my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, we might be
all Catholic Christians, whatever church or particular profession we joined
in; that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right principles;
and as he thought that the like charity would make us all Catholics, so I
told him I behaved, had all the members of his church the like moderation,
they would soon all be Protestants. And there we left that part; for we
never disputed at all. However, I talked to him another way, and taking
l' in] by the hand, " My friend," says I, " I wish all the clergy of the Romish
church were blessed with such moderation, and had an equal share of your
charity. I am entirely of your opinion; but I must tell you, that if you
should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the
Inquisition"--" It may he so," said he; " I know not what they would do
in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be the better Christians
for that severity; for I am sure there is no heresy in obounding with charity."

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there was
over, so we went back our own way ; and when we came back, we found them
waiting to be called in : observing this, I asked my clergyman if we should
discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not; and it was
his opinion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, and hear
what he would say to us: so we called him in alone, nobody being in the
place but ourselves, and I began by asking him some particulars about his
parentage and education. lie told me frankly enough that his father was a
clergyman who would have taught him well, but that he, Will Atkins,
despised all instruction and correction ; and by his brutish conduct cut the
thread of all his father's comforts and shortened his days, for that he broke
his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for the most alt'ectionate
treatment a father ever gave.

In what- he said there seemed so much sincerity of repentance, that it
painfully afi'ectcd me. I could not but reflect that I, too, had shortened the life
of a good tender father by my bad conduct and obstinate self-will. I was,
indeed, so surprised with what he had told me, that I thought, instead of my
going about to teach and instruct him, the man was made a teacher and
instructor to me in a most unexpected manner.

385 3 D
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected
with it, and said to me, " Did I not say, sir, tl;..t when this man was con-
verted he would preach to us all? 1 tell you, sir, if this one man be made a
true pcnitent, here will be no need of me; he will make Christians of all in
the islan ."-----But having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse
with Will Atkins. " But Will," said I, " how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now '1"

W. A.--Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart
through my very soul: I have been talking about God and religion to my
wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has
preached such it sermon to me us I shall never forget while I live.

R. a--No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you; but when you
were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung them back
upon you.

W. A.--Ay, air, with such force as is not to be resisted.

R. (Ii--Pray, Will, let us know what. passed between you and your
wife; for I know something of it already.

W. A--Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it; I am too
full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it; but let her have said
what she will, though I cannot give you an account of it, this I can tell
you, that I have resolved to amend and reform my life.

12. (Ii--But tell us some of it: how did you begin, Will? For this has
been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She has preached a sermon,
indeed, if she has wrought this upon you.

W. A.--'.Vhy, I first tcfi her the nature of our laws about marriage,
and what the reasons were that. men and women were obliged to enter into
such compacts, as it was neither in the power of one not other to break;
that otherwise, order and justice could not he maintained, and men would
run from their wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one
another, and neither families he kept entire, nor inheritances be settled lay
legal descent.

1t. Cfl--You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make her understmd
what you meant by inheritance and families? They know no such things
among the savages, but marry anyhow, without regard to relation, conson-
guinity, or family; brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the
father and the daughter, and the son and the mother.

W. A--I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife assures me of

the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps, for any further relations,
ass
they may not be so amt as we are; but she tells me never in the near
relationship you speak of.

R. C'.--Well, what did she say to what you told her?

W. A.--She said she liked it very well, as it- was much better than in
her country.

R. 0.--But did you tell her what marriage was?

W. A.---Ay, ay, there began our dialogue. I asked her if she would be
married to me our way She asked me what way that was; I told her
marriage was appointed by God; and here we had a stmnge talk together,
indeed, as ever 1111111 and wife had, I believe.

N B.--'I'his dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife, which I took
down in writing just after he had told it me, was as follows :--

sze--Appointed by your God 3 Why, have you a God in your
country? -

W. A .,--Yes my rlem, God is in every. country.

W-L' c. --No your God in my country; my counh y have the great old
Benamuckee God.

W. A.--- ~Child, I am very unfit; to show you who God is; God is in
heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that in
them is.

W fe --N'o mokee de eaith; no you God makee 11.11 earth; no makee my
connlav

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not making her
country.

Wife--No laugh; why laugh me? This no ting to laugh.

[He was justly roprovecl by his wife, for she was more serious than he
at first]

W. A. -----That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any more, my dear.

W fez--Why, you say you God makee all?

W. A .------Yes, child our God made the whole world, and you, and me,
and all things; for he is the only true God, and there is no God but him ;
he lives for ever in heuveu.

Wife--Why you no tell me long ago?

W. A.--'l'hut's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked wretch, and have
not only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything before, but have lived
without God in the world myself.

W11 e.----What, have yous great God in your country, you no know

him? No my 0 to him? N 0 do good ting for him? That no possible
387
W. A.----It is true; though, for all that, we live as if there was no God
in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

W7? law-But why God let you do so? Why he no makee you good live?

W. A.~Il is all our own fault
_ "fife--But you say me he is great, much great, have much great power;
can mukee kill when he will: why he no makee kill when you no serve
him? no say 0 to him? no be good mans?

W. A.-----Thul. is true, he might. strike me dead; and I ought to expect it,
for I have been a. wicked wretch, that is true; but God is merciful, and
does not deal with us as we deserve.

Wife--But then do you not tell God thankee for that too?

W. A.--No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy, any more
than I liuve feared God for his power.

i'l'ifila'l'hen you God no God; me no think, believe he be such one,
great much power, strong : no makee kill you, though you make him much
angry. '

W. A.--What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in God?
What a. dreadful creature am I! and what a sad truth is it, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of heathens!

ll'y'e.----How me Link you have great much God up there [she points
up to heaven], and yet- no do well, no do good thing? Can he tell? Sure
he no tell what you do?

W. A.--Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he hears us speak, sees
what- we do, knows what- we think, though we do not speak.

Wi e.--What ! he no hear you curse, swaar, speak de great damn?

W. A.----Yes, yes, he hears it all.

W'i a.---Where be then the much great power Show?

W. A.----lle is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and this proves
him to he the true God ; he is God, and not man, and therefore we are not
consumed.

[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think how he
could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that. he had dared to do
all the vile things he had done]

i-Vife.---Mereifull \Vhet you call dat?

W. A.--He is our father and maker, and he pities and spares us

Wafer--So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do wicked;

then he no good himself, or no great able.
888or Ronm'sox CRUSOE.

W. A.--Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely great, and
able to punish too; and sometimes, to show his justice and vengeance, he
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners and make examples ; many are out oil
in their sins.

Wife--But no makee kill you yet; then he tellyou, may be, that he no
makee you kill : so yOu makoe de bargain with him,- you do bad thing, he
no be angry at you when he be angry at other man's.

W. A.---.\'o, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon his goodness;
and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me, as he has done other
men.

W-i ci--Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what you say to him
for that? You no tell him thankee for all that too?

W. A.--I am an unthoukful, ungrateful dog, that is true.

"fife--Why he no ma-kee you much good better? you say he mokce
you.

W. A.--He made me as he made all the world ; it is I have deformed
myself and abused his goodness, and made myself an abominable \vretch.

Wife--I wish you makee God know me. I no makee him angry--J no
do bad wicked thing.

[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a poor
untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a wicked
wretch, that he could not say one word to her about God, but what the
reproach of his own carriage. would make most irrational to her to believe;
nay, that alreudy she. had told him that she could not believe in God,
because he, that was so wicked, was not destroyed]

W. Arr--Elly dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to know God,
not God to know you; for he knows you already, and every thought in your
heart.

Wife--Why, then, he know what I say to you now: he know me wish
to know him. How shall me know who malice me?

W. A.--Poor creature, he must teach thee: I cannot teach thee. I will
pray to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me, that am unworthy
to teach thee.

[The poor fellow was in such {in agony at her desiring him to make her
know God, and her wishing to know him, that he said he fell down on his
knees before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the saving
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being

the unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of religion:
339urn AND Abm'ronrs

after which he sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on. This
was the time when we saw him kneel down, and hold up his hands]

'75 e.--Whnt you put- (lown the knee for? What you hold up the hand
for? What you any? Who you speak to? What is all that?

W. A.----My dear, I how my knees in token of my submission to him
that made me : I said. 0 to him, as you call it, and as your old men do to
their idol Bcnamnekee ; that is, I prayed to him. '

Wi e.----What say you 0 to him for?

W. A.------I prayed to him to open your eyes and your understanding, that
you may know him, and be accepted by him.

Weft--Can he do that too?

W. A.--Yes, he can: he can do all things.

"fife--But now he hear what- you say?

W. A.---Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear us.

W1fe.--Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid you"! What
you hear him speak? '

W. A.-----No, we do not hear him speak; but he has revealed himself
many ways to us.

[Here he was at a. great loss to make her understand that God has
revealed himself to us by his word, and what his word was; but at last
he told it- her thus :--]

W. A.----God has spoken to some good men in former days, even from
heaven, by plain words ; and God hos inspired good men by his Spirit ; and
they have written all his laws down in a book.

Wife--Me no understand that ; where is hook?

W. 113--111"?! my poor creature, I have not this book; but I hope I
shall one time or other get. it for you, and help you to read it.

[Here he embraced her wiLh great affection, but with inexpressible grief
that he had not a Bible]

Wefes--But how you mokee me know (hut God leachee them to write
that book ?

W. A.----By the same rule that we know him to be God.

Wife--What rule? \Vhat- way you know him ?

W. A.--Beeuuse he teaches and commands nothing but what is good,
righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly good, as well as per-
fectly happy; and because he forbids, and commands us be avoid, all that
is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its consequence.

Wife--<<That me would understand, that me fair: see; if he teachee all
' 390
good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing, he hear me when I
say 0 to him, as you do just now; he maken me good, if I wish to be good ;
he spare me, no makce kill me, when 1 no be- good : all this you say he do,
yet he be great God: we take, think, believe him to be great God; me say
0 to him with you, my dear.

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her up, made her
kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge
of himself, by his Spirit; and that by some good providence, if possible, she
might, some time or other, come to have a Bible, that she might read
the Word of God, and be taught by it to know him. This was the time
that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her,
as above.

They hudseveral other discourses, it seems, after this ; and particularly
she made him promise that, since he confessed his own life had been a
wicked, abominable course of provocations against God, that he would
reform it, and not make God angry any more, lest he should make him
dead, as she called it, and then she would be left alone, and never be taught
to know this God better; and lest he should be miserable, us he had told
her wicked men would be, after death.

This was u. strange account, and very effecting to us both, but particu-
larly to the young clergyman; he was, indeed, wonderfully surprised with
it, but under the greatest affliction imgigineble that he could not talk to her,
that he could not speak English, to make her understand him ; and as she
spoke but very broken English, he could not understand her; however, he
turned himself to me, and told me that he believed that there must be more
to do with this women than to marry her. I did not understand him at
first; but at length he explained himself, viz. that she ought to be baptized
I agreed with him in that part readily, and wished it to be done presently.
"No, no; hold, sir," says he; " though I would have her be baptized, by all
means, for I must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has indeed
brought her, in a. wonderful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious
life, and has given her just ideas of the being of a God; of his power,
justice, and mercy: yet I desire to know of him if he has said anything to
her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith
in him, and redemption by him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the
last judgment, and the future state."

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor fellow fell

immediately into tears, and told us he had said something to her of all those
391
th ngs,hut that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own conscience
so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly life. that he trembled at the
apprehensions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she
should give to those things, and make her rather contemn religion than
receive it; but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to
receive due impressions of all those things, and that if I would but discourse
with her, she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would
not he. lost upon her.

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter between
my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to begin with her ; but
Sure such a semen was never preached by a Popish priest in these latter
ages of the world ; and, as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the
knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of a Roman
Catholic; and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the Roman bishops
were, before the church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the
consciences of men. In a word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace the
knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder and
astonishment only, as she did the first notions of a God, but with joy and
faith ; with an affection, and a. surprising degree of understanding, scarce to
be imagined, much less to be expreSscd -, and, at her own request, she was
baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that he would
perform that office with some caution, that the man might not perceive he
was of the Roman church, if possible, because of other ill consequences
which might attend a difference among us in that very religion which we
were instructing the other in. He told me. that as he had no consecrated
chapel, nor proper things for the office, I should see he would do it in a
manner that I should not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic myself,
it' I had not known it before; and so he did; for saying only some words
over to himself in Latin, which I could not understand, be poured a whole
dishfnl of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French, very loud,
" Mary (which was the name her husband desired me to give her, for I was
her godfather), 1 baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost;" so that none could know anything by it what
religion he was of. He gave the benediction afterwards in Latin, but either
Will Atkins did not know but it was French, or else did not take notice of
it at that time.

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and after the marriage was
392
over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner exhorted
him, not only to persevere in that good disposition he was in, but to support
the convictions that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life: told
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes;
represented to him how God had honoured him with being the instrument
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he
should be careful he did not dishonour the grace of God; and that if he
did, he would see the heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage
converted, and the instnrment cast away. He said a. great many good
things to them both; and then, recommending them to God's goodness, gave
them the benediction again, I repeating everything to them in English ; and
thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant and agreeable
day to me that ever I passed in my whole life. But my clergyman had not
done yet: his thoughts hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty-
sevon savages, and fain he would have stayed upon the island to have
undertaken it; but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was imprac-
ticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a way of
being done in his absence to his satisfaction.

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass,
I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had
taken out of the famishcd ship's company came to me, and told me he
understood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the English-
men to be married to the savages: that he had a match too, which he
desired might be finished before I went, between two Christians, which he
hoped would not be disagreeable to me

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's servant,
for there was no other Christian woman on the island: so I began to
persuade him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or because he found
himself in this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he had
some considerable Substance in the world, and good friends, as I understood
by himself, and the maid also; that the maid was not only poor, and a
servant, but was unequal to him, she being six or seven and twenty years
old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; that he might very probably,
with my assistance, make :1 remove from this wilderness, and conre into
his own country again; and that then it would be a thousand to one
but he would repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to say more, but he

interrupted mo, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that
398 - 3 1-:
I mistook in my guesses--that he had nothing of that kind in his
thoughts; and he was very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting
them in a way to see their own country again; and not-hing should
have made him think of staying there, but that the voyage I was going
was so exceeding long and hamrdous, and would carry him quite out of
the reach of all his friends; that he had nothing to desire of me, but
that I would settle him in some little property in the island where he
was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he would
live here like a. planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I returned
to England, I would redeem him. He hoped I would not be unmindful of
him when I came to England: that he would give me some letters to his
friends in London, to let them know how good I had been to him, and in
what part of the world, and what circumstances I had left him in: and
he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all
the improvements he had mode upon it, let the value be what it would,
should be wholly mine,

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considerm his youth, and
was the more agreeable to me, because he told me positively the match
was not for himself I gave him all possible assurances that. if I lived
to come safe to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his business
effectually; and that he might depend I should never forget the circum-
stances I had left him in; but still I was impatient to know who was
the person to be married; upon which he told me it was my Jack-of-ull-
trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably surprised when he
named the match; for, indeed, I thought it very suitable. The character
of that man I have given already; and as for the maid, she was a. very
honest, modest, sober, and religious young woman: had a very good share
of sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handsomely and
to the purpose, always with decency and good manners, and was neither
too backward to speak when requisite, nor imperiinently forward when
it was not her business; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent
manager; fit, indeed, to have been governess to the whole island ; and she
knew very well how to behave in every respect.

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them the same
day ; and as I was father at the nltm; and gave her away, so I gave her
a portion; for l appointed her and her husband a handsome large space
of ground for their plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal

the young gentleman made to give him a small property in the island,
3"
put me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they might not quarrel
afterwards about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was now
grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly
pious and religious; and, as far as I may be allowed to speak positively
in such a case, I verily believe he was 0. true penitent. Tic divided things
so justly, and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused to be
drawn up, and signed and sealed, setting out the bounds and situation
of every man's plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally
a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective plants>>
tions or farms, with their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving
all the rest of the island as my own property, and a certain rent for every
particular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in
my name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy of the some
writing. As to the government and laws among them, I told them I
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give
themselves ; only I made them promise me to live in love and good neigh-
bourhood with one another; and so I prepared to leave them.

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being new settled in a
kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much business
in hand, it was odd to have seven--and-thirty Indians live in a. neck
of the island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed; for, excepting the
providing themselves food, which they had diificulty enough to do, some-
times they had no manner of business or property to manage. I proposed,
therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that he should go to them, with
Friday's father, and propose to them to remove, and either plant for
themselves, or be taken into their several families as servants, to be
maintained for their labour, but Without being absolute slaves; for 1
would not permit them to make them slaves by force, by any means;
because they had their liberty given them by capitulation, as it were
articles of surrender, which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very cheer-
fully along with him: so we allotted them land and plantations, which
three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as servants
in the several families we had settled. Thus my colony was in a manner
settled as follows :--The Spaniards possessed my original habitation, which

was the capital city, and extended their plantations all along the side of
395
the brook, which mode. the creek that I have so often described, as far as
my bower; and as they increased their culture, it went always eastward.
The English lived in the north-east part, where Will Atkins and his
comrades began, and came on southward and south-west, towards the
back part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a. great addition
of land to take in, if they found oocasion, so that they need not jostle
one another for want of room. All the east end of the island was left
uninhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there only
for their usual customary l'unrbarities, they might come and go; if they
disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them: and no doubt but they
were often ashore, and went away again; for I never heard that the
planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more.

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the
clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be set
on foot in his absence to his satisfwtion, and l told him that now I thought
that it was put in a fair way ; for the savages, heilg thus divider! among
the Christians, if they would but every one of them do their part with
those which came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very good
effect.

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. " But. how," says he,
" shall we obtain that of them?" I told him we would call them all
together, and leave it in charge with them, or go to them, one by one,
which he thought best; so we divided it,~he to speak to the Spaniards,
who were all Papists, and I to speak to the English, who were all
Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly to them, and made them
promise that they would never make any distinction of Papist or Pro-
testant in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but teach them
the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ;
and they likewise promised us that they would never have any differences
or disputes one with another about religion.

When I came to Will Atkins's house, I found them the young woman
I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were become intimates;
and this prudent, religious young woman had perfected the work Will
Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four days after what
I have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman was made such a
Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my observation or conversation
in the world. It come next- into my mind in the morning before I

went to them, that amongst all the needful things I had to leave with

them, I had not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less
considering for them than my good friend the widow was for me when
she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed
up three Bibles and a. Prayer-hook. However, the good woman's charity
had a greater extent than ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the

comfort and instruction of those that made much better use of them than
I had done

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will
Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman and Atkins's baptized
wife had been disooursing of religion together--for Will Atkins told
it me with a great deal of joy--I asked if they wexe together now, and

he said, yes; so I went into the house, and he with me, and we found
397
them together very earnest in discourse. "0h, sir," says Will Atkins,
"when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring home,
he never wants a. messenger; my wife has got a new instructor: I knew
I was unworthy as I was incapable of that work; that young woman has
been sent hither from heaven--she is enough to convert a whole island of
savages." The young woman blushed, nnd rose up to go away, but I
desired her to sit still; I told her she had a good work upon her hands,
and I hoped God would bless her in it.

We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had any book among
them, though I did not ask ; but I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled
out my Bible ; " Here," said I to Atkins, " I have brought you an assistant
that perhaps you had not before." The man was so confounded, that he
was not able to speak for some time; but, recovering himself, he takes
it with both his hands, and turning to his wife, " Here, my dear," says he,
" did not I tell you our Godhthough he lives above, could hear what we
have said? Here's the book I prayed for when you and I kneeled down
under the hush; now God has heard us, and sent it." When he had said
so, the man fell into such passionate transports, that between the joy
of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like
a child that was crying

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake that
none of us were aware of : for she firmly believed God had sent the hook
upon her husband's petition. It is true that providentially it was so, and
might be taken so in a consequent serise ; but I believe it would have been
no difficult matter at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to have
believed that an express messenger came from Heaven on purpose to
bring that individual book. But it was too serious a matter to suffer
any delusion to take place, so I turned to the young woman, and told
her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert in her first and more
ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to explain to her that
(ind may be very properly said to answer our petitions, when, in the couise
of his providence, such things are in n particular manner brought to pass
as we petitioned for: but we did not expect returns from Heaven in a
miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy that it is not so.

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there was no
priestornft used here; and I should have thought it one of the most
unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. But the efi'ect upon

Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; and there we may be sure was
' 898
no delusion. Sure no man was over more thankful in the world for any
thing of its kind than he was for the Bible--nor, I believe, never any man
was glad of a, Bible from a better principle; and though he had been :1
most profiigate creature, headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet
this man is a standing rule to us all for the wall instructing children, viz
that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair
of the success of their endeavours, let the children be ever so refractory, or
to uppwrunce inscnsiblc to instruction; for, if ever God, in his providence,
touches the conscience of such, the force of their education returns upon
them, and the early instruction of parents is not lost,.though it may have
been many years laid asleep, but some time or other they may find the
benefit of it, Thus it was with this poor man: however ignorant he was
of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had some to do with now
more ignorant than himself, and that the least part of the instruction of his
good father that now come to his mind was of use to him.

Among the rest, it occurred to him, hc said, how his father used to insist
so much on the inexpressiblc value of the Bible, and the privilege and
blessing of it to nations, families, and persons; but he never entertained
the least notion of the worth of it till now, when being to talk to heathens,
savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for his
assistance The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion,
though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship among their
goods, which were not yet brought on shore. And now, having said so
many things of this young woman, 'I cannot omit telling one story more of
her and myself, which has something in it very instructive and remarkable

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced;
how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board that unhappy ship
we met at sea, and how the whole ship's company was reduced -to the last
extremity, The gentlewoman, and her son, and this maid, were first hardly
used as to provisions, and at last totally neglected and starved,----that is to
say, brought to the last extremity of hunger. One day, bciug discbursing
with her on the extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could describe,
by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared '2 She
said she believed she could, and told her tale very distinctly thus :--

"First, we had for some days fared exceeding hard, and suffered very
great hunger; but at last we were wholly without food of any kind, except
sugar, and a. little wine-aniwater. The first day after I had received no

food at all, I found myself, towards evening, empty and sick at the stomach,
399
and nearer night much inclined to yawning and sleep. I lay down on the
couch in the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked
a little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down; after
being about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock iii-the morning,
I found myself empty, and my stomiwh sickish, and lay down again, but
could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill ; and thus I continued all the
second day with a strange variety,--first hungry, then sick gain, with
rctchings to vomit, The second night, being obliged to go to bed again
without any food, more than a drought of fresh water, and being asleep, I
drwmed I was at Barbadocs, and that the market was mightily stocked
with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined
very heartily. I thought my stomach was full after this, as it would have
been after a good dinner; but when I awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in
my spirits to find myself in the extremity of famine The last glass of-
wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its having some spirit
to supply nourishment; but there being no substance in the stomach for
the digesting office to work upon, I found the only effect of the wine was
to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay, as
they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third
day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused, and inconsistent
dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious
with hunger; and I question, had not my understanding returned and
conquered it, whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little child
with me, its life would have been safe or not This lasted about three
hours, during which time I was twice raging mad as any creature in
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can now inform you.

"In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down and struck
my face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mistress lay, and
with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy
bringing me a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal ; and as
the blood came from me, I came to myself, and the violence of the flame or
fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I '
grew sick, and mtched to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in my
stomach to bring up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and they all
believed I was dead 3 but I came to myself soon after, and then had a most
dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described--not like the colic, but a
gnawing, eager pain for food ; and towards night it went off with a kind of

earnest wishing or longing for food. I took another draught of water with
400
sugar in it ; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again;
then I look a. draught of water without sugar, and that stayed with me;
and I laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily that it would
please God to take me away; and composing my mind in hopes of it,
I slumbered awhile, and then waking, thought myself dying, being light
with vapours from on empty stomach. I recommended my soul then to
God, and then earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into the
sea.
. " All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, expiring, but
she bare it with much more patience than i, and gave the last bit of bread
she had left to her child, my young master, who would not have taken it,
but she obliged him to eat it; end I believe it saved his life. Towards the
morning I slept again; and when I awoke I fell into a violent passion of
crying, and after that had a. second fit of violent hunger. I got up ravenous,
and in a most dreadful condition; and once or twice I was going to bite
my own arm. At last I saw the basin in which was the blood I had bled
at my nose the day before: I ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste,
and such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it before,
and afmid it should be taken from me now. After it was down, though the
thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and I
took another draught of water, and was composed and refreshed for some
hours after. This was the fourth day; and thus I kept up till towards
night, when, within the compass of three hours, I had all the several
circumstances over again, one alter another, viz, sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry,
pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then lunatic, then
crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour, and my
strength wasted exceedingly; at night I lay me down, having no comfort
but in the hope that I should die before morning.

" All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger was now turned into a
disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind, instead of food
having found its way into the bowels; and in this condition I lay till
morning, when I was surprised by the cries and lamentetions of my yormg
master, who called out to me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up
a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not deed, though
she was able to give very little signs of life I had then such convulsions
in my stomach, for want of some sustenance, as I cannot describe; with
such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, as nothing but the tortures of
death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen

401 3 y
above cry out, 'A sail ! a sail !' and halloo and jump about. an if they were
distracted. I was not able to get oil" from the hurl, and my mistress much
less; and my young master was so sick, that I thought. he had been ex--
piring; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any ncoount what it
was that occasioned such confusion ; nor had we had 8113' conversation with
the ship's company for two days, they having told us that they had not
a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship; and this they told us often
wards--they thought we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition
we were in when you were sent to save our lives ; and how you found us,
sir, you know as well as I, and better too."

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of starving to
death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding instructive to me,
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because the youth
gave me an account of a good part of it; though I must own, not so
distinct and so feeling as the maid; and the rather, because it seems his
mother fed him at the price of her own life: but the poor maid. whose
constitution was stronger than that of her mistress, who was in yours, and
a weakly woman too, might struggle harder with it ; nevertheless, she might
be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who
might be allowed to keep the last hit something longer than she parted with
any to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here related, if our
ship, or some other, had not so providentially met them, but a few days more
would have ended all their lives. I now return to my disposition of things
among the people. And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many
reasons I did not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had
framed, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I found, at
least of. my first coming, such seeds of division among them, that I saw
plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon
every light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one another; or
perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves,
instead of a. plantation of sober and religious people, as I intended it; nor
did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the extra
two quarter-deck guns that my nephew had provided, for the same reason.
I thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against any
that should invade them, but not to set them up for an offensive war, or to
go abroad to attack others : which, in the end, would only bring min and
destruction upon them I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for

their service another way, as I shall ohsm-ve in its place.
402
Having now done with the. island, I lel'c them all in good circumstances.
and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship again on the 6th
of May, 11an been about. twenty--live days among them: and as they
were all resolved to slay upon the island bill I came to remove them]

promised 'oo send them fluthcr relief from the Bmzils, if I could possibly
find an oppoxtunity, I particularly promised to send them some cattle.
such as sheep, hogs, and cows: as to the two cows and calves which I
brought from England, we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage,

to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.
+n3
Tho next (lay, giving them a. salute of five guns at parting, we set sail,
and arrived at the buy of All Saints in the Bmzils, in about twenty-two
days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this : that about three
days after we had sailed, being heoslmed, and the current setting strong to
thc ENE, running, as it were, into :1. boy, or gulf on the land side, we were
driven something out of our course, and once or twice our men cried out,
" Land to the eastward ! " but whether it was the continent or islands we
could not tell by any means. But the third day, towards evening, the sea
smooth, and the Weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered towards
the land with something very block; not being able to discover what it
was, till after some time, our chief mate, going up the main-shrouds a little
way, and looking at them with a perspective, cried out it was an army. I
could not imagine what he meant by an army, and thwarted him a. little
hastily. "Nay, sir," says he, " don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet
too; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them
paddle along, for they are coming towards us space."

I was u. little surprised then indeed, and so was my nephew, the
captain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island, and
having never been in those seas before, that he could not tell what to think
of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be devoured. 1 must
confess, considering we were becalmed, and the current set strong towards
the shore, I liked it the worse; however, I bode them not be afraid, but
bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we. came so near as to know that we
must engage them. The weather continued calm, and they came on npace
towards us, so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and furl nil our sails ; as
for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but fire, and therefore
the)r should get their beats out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and
the other by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue in that
posture: this I did, that the men in the boots might be ready with sheets
and buckets to put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix to the
outside of the ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came up
with us; but never was such horrid sight seen by Christians: though my
mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet when they
came up we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six canoes; some of
them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the least
six or seven. When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with

wonder and astonishment, as at a. sight which doubtless they had never
404
seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards understood, know
what to make 01' us; they came boldly up, however, very near to us, and
seemed to go about 'to row mund us; but we called to our men in the
boats not to let them come too near they. This very order brought us to
an engagement with them, without our designing it; for five or six of the
large canoes came so near our long-boat. that our men beckoned with their
hands to keep them back, which they understood very ivell, and went,

 

1810:? B KILLED.

back: but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us from those
boats, and one of our men in the. long hoot was very much wounded.
However, I called to than: not to fire by any means; but we handed down
some deal hoards into the boot, and the carpenter present-1y set up a kind
of fence, like waste beams, to cover them from the arrows of the snvges,
if they should shoot again.

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a. body astem of

us and so near that we could easily discern what they were, though We.-
405 -
could not tell their design ; and l easily found they were some of my old
friends, the same sort of savages that l had been used to engage with. In a
short time more they rowed a little further out to sea, till they came directly
broadside with us, and then rowed down straight. upon us, till they came so
near that they could hear us speak ; upon this I ordered all my men to keep
close, lest they should shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns ready;
but being so near as to be. within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck, and cull out- nloud to them in his language, to know what they meant.
Whether they understood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he
had called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost or n'ghest boat to
us, turned their canoes from us, and stooping down, showed us their nnkcd
backs ; whether this was a defiance or challenge We knew not, or whether
it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest: but immediately
Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and, unhappily for him, poor
fellow, they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inex-
pressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their sight The
poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows, and about three more
fell very near him ; such unlucky marksman they were !

I was so annoyed at the loss of my old trusty servant and companion,
that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot, and four
with great, and gave them such it broadside asthey had never heard in
their lives before. They were not above hall" a cable's length oli' when we
fined; and our gunners took their nim so well, that three or four of their
canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare backs to us gave us no great
offence; neither did I know for certain Whether that which would pass for
the greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them or not;
therefore, in return, I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at
them with powder only, which I knew would frighten them sufficiently:
but when they shot at us directly with all the fury they were capable of,
and especially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved
and valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought myself not only
justifiable before God and man, but would have been very glad if I could
have overset every canoe there, and drowned every one of then).

I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we wounded at
this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen among such
a multitude ;. there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset

in all, and the men all set a--swimming: the rest, frightened out of their
' 406chum: "mus mm an EIS mnmlux. samur-

wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many
of them were lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his
life, above an hour after they were all gone The small shot from our
cannon must needs kill and wound a great many; but, in short, we never
knew how it went with them, for they fled so fast, that in three hours, or
thercebouts, we could not see above three or four straggling canoes, nor did'
we ever see the rest any more 5 for a breeze of wind springing up the same.
evening, we weighed, and set sail for the Bruzils.

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he would
neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve himself to death.
But 1 took u way to cure him: for I made them take him and turn him

into the long-boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the sen;
407
again, and so leave him where they found him, if he would not speak; nor
would that do, but they really did throw him into the see, and came away
from him. Then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to
them in his tongue, though they knew not one word of what he said;
however, at last they took him in again, and then he began to be more
tractable : nor did I ever design they should drown him.

We were new under sail again, but I was the most disconsolate creature
alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been very glad to have
gone back to the island, to have taken one of the rest from thence for my
mansion, but it. could not be; so we went on. We. had one prisoner, as
l have said, and it was a long time before we could make him understand
anything ,1 but, in time,'0u1' men taught. him some English. and he. begun to
be a little tractable. Afterwards, we inquired what country he came from,
but could make nothing of whut he said; for his speech was so odd, all
gut-tumls, and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we
could never form a word after him; and we were all of opinion that they
might Speak that. language as well if they were gagged as otherwise; nor
could we perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips,
or palate, but fonned their words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune with
an Open throat He told us, however, some time after, when we had taught
him to speak a little English, that they were going with their kings to fight
a. great. battle, When he said kings, we asked him how many kings? He.
said they were five nution (we could not make him understand the plural s),
and that they 3.11 joined to go against. two nation We asked him what
made them come up to us? He said, "To molten 19. great wonder look."
Here it is to he observed, that all those natives, as also those of Africa,
when they learn English, always add two 15S at the end of the words where
we use one ; and they place the accent upon them, as muluee, lukee, and the
like ; nay, i could hardly make Friday leave it. 011', though at last he did.

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my lust leave
of him. l'oor honest Friday} We buried him with all the decency and
solemnitjr possible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him into the
sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him. So ended the life of the
most grateful, l'aitht'uL honest, and most ull'eetionate servant that ever
man had.

\Ve went. now awuy with a, fair wind for Brazil; and in about twelve
days' time we made hind, in the latitude of five degrees: south ol' the line.
being the north-easternmost land of all that part of Amerieu. We kept on

408
S. by E, in sight of the. shore four days, when we made Cope St. Augustine,
and in three. days came to an anchor in the bay of All Saints, the old place
of my deliverance, from whence came both my good and evil fate. Never
ship came to this port that had less business than I had, and yet it was
with great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least correspondence
on shore: not my partner himselfimho was alive. and made a great figure
among them, not my two merclntntrtmsteos, not the fame of my wonderful
preservation in the island, could obtain me that favour. My partner, how.
ever, remembering that I had given five hundred moidores to the Prior ol'
the Monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was to go to
the governor, and get leave for me personally, with the captain and one
more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and this upon
condition, absolutely capitulatcd for, that we should not- oh'er to land any
goods out of the ship, or to carry-zany person away without licence. They
were so strict with us, as to landing any goods, that it was with extreme
difficulty that I got on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine
broadcloth; studs, and some linen, which I had brought- for a present to
my partner.

He was a very generous, open-hearted man ; although he began, like me,
with little at. first. Though he knew not that. I had the least design of
giving him anything, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions,
wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores, including some tobacco,
and three or four fine medals of gold: but I was even with him in my
present, which, as I have said, consisted of fine broadcloth, English stufils,
lace, and fine holland ; also, l delivered him about the value of one hundred
pounds sterling, in the some goods, for other uses; and 1 obliged him to set
up the sloop, which I had brought with me from England, as I have said,
for the use of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I intended to
my plantation.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very few days,
for she was already framed ; and I gave the master of her such instructions
that he could not miss the place ; nor did he, as I had my. account from my
partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with the. small cargo I sent them ;
and one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me there, oll'ered to go
with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter to the gaudy-nut Spaniard, to
allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a. plantation, and on my giving
him some clothes and tools for his planting work, which he said he under-

409 3 o
stood, having been an old pluntor at Maryland, and a hucanecr into the-
bm'gnin. l encouraged the fellow By granting all he desiicd; and, as an
addition, I gave. him the savage whom we had taken prisoner of war, to be-
his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him his share of every-
thing he wanted with the rest. "

When we come to fit- t-his nntn out, my old partner told me there was a
certain very honest follow, 9. Brazil planter of his iicquaintnnce, who haul
fallen into the displeasure of the church. " I know not what the matter is
with him," says he, "but, on my conscience, I think he is a horctic in his
heart, and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition."
Ho then told me that ho would be very glad of such an opportunity to make
his escape, with his wife and two daughters ; and if I would let them go to
my island, and allot them a plantation, he would give them a small stock to
begin with--for the officers of the. Inquisition had seized all his effects and
estate, and he had nothing left but a. little household stuff, and two slaves ',
" rind," adds he, " though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him
{all into their hands, for he will he assuredly burned alive if he does," I
granted this presently, and oined my Englishman with them: and we
concealed tho mun, and his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the
sloop put out to go to sea ; and then having put all their goods on board
some time before, we put thorn on board the sloop after she was got out of
the bay. Our serum!) was mightily pleased with lhis new partner; and
their skunks, indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and u
farm--hut nothing to begin with, except as above: however, they carried
over with them, what was worth all the rest, some materials for planting
sugarcane; with some plants of cones, which he, I moon the. Brazil
planter, understood very well.

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I sent
them by the sloop three milch cows nnd five calves, about twenty~two hogs
among them, three sows, two mares, and a. stone-horse. For my Spaniards,
according to my promise, I engaged three Brazil women to go, and mooni-
mcnded it to them to marry them, and use: them kindly. i could have
procured more Women, but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had
two daughters, and that there were but live of the Spaniards that wanted
paituers,--t-hc rest. had wives of their own, though in another country. All
this cargo arrived safe. and, as you may easily suppose, was very welcome
to my old inlndiitants, who were now, with this addition, between sixty and:
seventy people, liesides little children, of which there were a great many.

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about it:
and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do well to turn his
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of an old man,
not warned by his own harms, much less by those of other men, to beware;
not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and disappointments--not satisfied
with prosperity beyond expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and
distress beyond example

,'I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full
liberty has to go to the turnkey at; Ncwgate, and desire him to lock him up
among the prisoners there, and starve him. Had 1 taken a. small vessel
from England, and gone directly to the island; had I loaded her, us I did
the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation, and for my
people; taken a patent fiom the government here to have secured my
property, in subjection only to that of England; had I carried over cannon
and ammunition, servants and people to plant, and taken possession of the
place; fortified and strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it
with people, as I might easily have done? had I then settled myself there,
and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as l ml": also have done in
six months' time, and ordered my friends to have titted her out again for
our supply,--haxl I done this, and stayed there myself, I had at. least acted
like a man of common sense. But I was possessed of a wandering spirit,
and scorned all advantages: I pleased myself with being the patron of the
people I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic
way, like an old patriarchal nicnierch,'providing for them as if I had been
father of the whole family, as well as of the plantation. But I never so
much as pretended to plant in the name of' any government or nation, or to
acknowledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation
more than another: nay, I never so much us gave the place a name, but
left. it as I found it, belonging in nobody, and the people under no discipline
or government: but my own; who, though I bad influence over them as a
father and benefactor, had no authority or power to act or command one
way or other, further than voluntary consent moved them to comply. Yet
even this, had I stayed there, would have done well enough; but as I
rsmltnled from them, and came there no more, the last letters I had from any
of them were by my partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop to

the place, and who sent me word, though I had not the letter till I got to
41]
London, several years after it was written, that they went- on but poorly,
were discontent with their long stay there: that Will Atkins was dead;--
that five of the Spaniards were come n.\vay,----and though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes with
them ; and that they begged of him to mite to me to think of the promise
Iliad made to fetch them away, that they might see their country again
before they died.

But I was gone a wildgoose chase, indeed! and they that will have any
more of me, must be content to follow me into a new.variety of follies,
hardships, and Wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may be
duly observed ; and we may see how easily Heaven can goige us with our
own desires, make the. strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish
us most severely with those very things which we think it would be our
utmost happiness to be allowed to possess. Whether I had business or no
business, away I went: it is no time new to enlarge upon the reason or
absurdity of my own conduct, hut to come to the history--I was embarked
for the voyage, and the voyage I went.

T shall only add a. word or two concerning my honest Popish clergy-
man, --for let their opinions of us, and all other heretics in general, as they
call us. he as unchsritohle as it may, I veriljr believe this man was very
sincere, and wished the good of all men: yet I believe he used reserve in
many of his expressions, to prevent giving me Ofihnce; for l scarce heard
him once cull on the Blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jagu, or his guardian
angel, though so common with the rest of them. However, I say, I had
not the least doubt of his sincerity and pious intentions: and 1 am lll'llll)'
of opinion, if the rest or the I'opish missionaries were like. him, they would
strive to visit. even the poor Tar-tars and Laplanders, where they have nothing
to give them, as well as covet to flock to India, Persia, China, Sm. the most
wealthy of the heathen countries; for if they expected to bring no gains
to their church by it, it may well be admired how they came to admit the
Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Christian saints.

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pinns priest asked me leave
to go thither; being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage
he began. How happy it had been for me il' 1 had gone with him ! But
it was too late new: all things Heaven appoints for the best: hari I gene
with him, I had never llml so many things to be thankful for, and the render
had never heard of the second part of the travels and advontnms of Robin-

son Crusoe; so I must here leave exelaiming at myself, and go on with my'
412
voyage. From the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the
Cape of Good Hope, and hade tolei-ubly good voyage, our course generally
south-east, now and then a storm, and some contrary winds : but my disas-
ters at see were at an end--my future rubs and cross events were to befall
me on share, that it might appear the land was as well prepared to be our
scourge as the sea.

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a. supcrcargo on board. who

was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only being
limited to a certain number of days for stay, by charter-party, at the several
ports she was to go to This was none of my business, neither did I meddle
with it; my nephew, the captain, and the supemmgo, adjusting all those
things between them as they thought fit. We stayed at the Cape no longer
than was needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for
the coast of Coromandcl. We were, indeed, informed that a French man-
of-wnr, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone for the Indies;
and as I know we were at war with France, I had some apprehensions of
them ~, but they went their own way, and we heard no more of them.
' T shell not pester the reader with a teclic'ius description of places, jour-
nals of our voyigcs, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade-winds. 8w. ;
it. is enough to name the ports and places which we touched at, and what
occurred to us upon our passage from one to another. We touched first
at the island of Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and
treacherous, and very well armed with Lenses and bows, which they use
with inconceivable dexterity, yet We fared very well with them awhile.
They treated us very civilly; and for some triflcs which we gave them.
such as knives, scissors, Sac. they brought us eleven good fat hullocks, of a
middling size, which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We wcrc obliged to stay here some time after We had furnished our-
selves with provisions; and 1, who was always too curious to look into
every nook of the world wherever I came, went on show as often as I
could. It was on the cast side of the island that we weul. on shore one
evening: and the people, who, by the wny, are Vcry numerous, came
tin-ringing about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance. As wc had traded
freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no
dungcr; but when we saw the people, we out three honghs out of a tree,
and stuck them up at n distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in
that country, not only of a. truce and h'iendship, but when it is accepted,

413
the other side set up three poles or houghs, which is a. signal that the)-
aceept the trace too; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that
you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards them, nor they to come
past your three poles, or houghs, towards you; so that you are perfectly
secure within the three poles, and all the space between your poles and
theirs is allowed like a market for free converse, trufiic, and commerce.
\l'hen you go there, you must not carry your weapons with you; and if
they come into that space, they stick up their javelins and lanees all at the
first poles, and come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered them, and
the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their
weapons, and the truce is at on end.

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater number
of their people came down than usual, but all very friendly and civil; and
they brought several kinds of provisions, for which we satisfied them with
such toys as We had; the women also brought us milk and roots, and several
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made us a little
tent or hut of some boughs or trees, and lay on shore all right. I know
not what was the occasion, but I was not so well satisfied to lie on shore as
the rest; and the boat riding at an anchor at about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of them come
on shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover as also in the boat,
I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of the
branches of the trees all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of our men make a
terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake, to bring the boat in,
and come and help them, for they were all like to be murdered; at the same
time, 1 heard the fire of five muskets, which was the number of guns they
had, and that three limes over; for, it seems, the natives here were not so
easily frightened with guns as the savages Were in America, where I had to
do with them. All this while I knew not what- was the matter, but rousing
immediately from sleep with the noise, I mused the boat to he thrust in,
and resolved, with three fusees we had on board, to land and assist our
men. We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too nuich
haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water, to get to
the bout with all the expedition they could, being pursued by between three
and four hundred mm. 0m: men were but nine in all, and only five of
them had fumes with them; the root had pistols and swords, indeed, but

they Were of small use to them.
41.}
We took up seven of our men, and with difficult-y endngh too, three of
them being very ill wounded; and that. which was still worse was, that
while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger
'as they were in on shore ; for they poured their arrows iu upon us so thick
"that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches,
and two or three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by
mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it
seems, such exact marksman, than, if they could have seen but the least-
parl. of any of us, they would have been sure of us. We had, by the light.
-of the menu, a little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore

'with darts and arrows; and having got really our fire-arms, we gave them
a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of some of them, had wounded
several; however, they stood thus in battle array on the shore till birak of
day, which We supposed was that they might see the better to take their
aim at us.

In this condition. we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our anchor, or
'set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat, and they were
as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. W 9
made signals of distress to the. ship, and, though she rode a league oil; yer.
my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the
posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty well under-

416
stood us; and weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as
he durst with the ship, and then sent another bout, with too hands in her,
to assist us We called to them not to come too near, telling them what
condition we were in; however, they stood in near to us, and one of the
men taking the end of a tow--lino in his hand, and keeping one boat between
him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam on board
us. and made fusi- t-he line to the bout; upon which we slipped out a little
cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the
arrows; we all the while lying close behind the barricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and the show, that we could
lay her side to the shore, she ran along just by them, and poured in a boond-
side among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and
such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had time to examine
into the occasion of this fray ;-and, indeed, our superourgo, who had been
often in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he was sure the inhabitants
would not have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not done
something to provoke them to it. At length, it came out that an old woman,
who had come to sell us some milk, hm] brought it within our poles, and a
young woman with her, who also brought some mots or herbs; and while
thelold woman (whether she was mother to the young woman or no they
could not tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness
to the girl that was with her, at which the old women made a great norse:
however, the seamen would not quit his prize, hutcurried her out of the old
woman's sight among the trees, it being almost dark; the old woman went
away without her, and, as we may suppose, made an outcry among the
people she came from ; who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in
three or four hours, and it was great odd-3 but we had all heen destroyed.
One of our men was killed with n, lance thrown at him just at the
beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made; the
rest came of free, all hut the fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief,
who paid dear enough for his brutality, for we could not hear what became
of him for a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though
the wind presented, and made signals for him, and made our hoot soil up
shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain; so we were obliged to
give him over; and if he alone had sull'ered for it, the loss had been less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on shore once more,
to try if I could learn anything of him or them: it. was the third night
416
after the action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could by any moons,
what mischief we had done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side.
I was careful to do it in the dark, lest we should he attacker! again: but 1
ought, indeed, to have been sure that the men 1 went with had been under
my command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as
l was hmught into by it, without design.

We took twenty as stout follows with in; as any in the ship, besides the
supercargo and myself, end we landed two hours before midnight, at the
some place where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening before. I

 

'um Mimi-{S . . .AIJATIO.

landed here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they
had quitted the field, and il' they had left any marks behind them of the
mischief we had done them; and I thought if we could surprise one or two
of them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of exchange.

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bodies,
whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the. other. We neither saw
nor heard anybody stir when we landed: and we mamhed up, one body at
a distance from the other, to the plzwc. At fimt- we could see nothing, it being
very dark; till by-and-hy on: boatswain, who led the first party, stumbled.
and fell over a. dead body. This made them halt awhile; for knowing by

417 3 u
the circumstances that they were at the place where the Indians had stood.
they waited for my coming up there, We concluded to halt till the moon
began to rise, which we knew would he in less than an hour, when we could
easily discern the havoc we had made among them. "'e told thirty-two
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead; some had an
arm, and some a leg shot ofl', and one his head ; those that were wounded,
we supposed, they had carried away. When we had mode, as I thought, a
full discovery of all we could come ix) the knowledge of, I resolved on going
on hoard; but the hoatswain and his party sent me word that they were
resolved to make a visit to the Indian town. where these dogs, as they called
them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with them; and if they could find
them, as they still fancied they should, they did not doubt of getting a good
booty; and it might be they might (ind Ton: Jeffry there: that was the
man's name we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what onswor
to have given them ; for I should have commended them instantly on board.
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had in ship and ship-
loading in 'Our charge, and a voyage to make which depended very much
upon the lives of the men ; but as they sent me word they were resolved to
go, and only asked me and my company to go along with them, I positively
refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in order to go to the
boat. One or two of the men began to importnne me to go; and when I
refused, began to grumble, and any they were not under my command, and
they would go. " Come, Jack," says one of the men, " will you go with me?
I'll go for one." J ook said he would,----and then onether,----and, in a word,
they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the
boat So the snpcrcargo and I, with the third man, went back to the boot,
where we told them we would stay for them, and take care In take in as
many of them as should he left; For I told them it was a mod thing they were
going about, and supposed most of them would have the fate of Tom Jeffry.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come off
again, and they would take care, 850.; so away they went. I exit-rented them
to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and
that they were int-rusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they
miscarried, the ship might he lost for want of their help, and that they
could not answer for it to God or man. But I might as well have talked to
the mainmnst. of the ship: they were mad upon their journey; only they

gave. me good words, and heggml T would not be angry; that they did not
418
doubt but they would be back again in about an hour at furthest; for the
Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile ofi', though they found it
above two miles before they got to it.

Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate. and
such as none but medmen would have gone about, yet, to give them their
due, they went about it as wnrily as boldly; they were gsllantly armed, for
they had every man at l'usce or musket, a bayonet, and a. pistol; some of
them had broad outlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain and
two more had poleaxes; besides all which, they had among them thirteen
hand grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any
wicked work in the world. When they went out, their chief design was
plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a. circum--
stance which none of them were aware of set them on (he with revenge, and
made devils of them all.

When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had
been the. town, which was not above half a mile off, they, were under great
<<liszqznpointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and
where the town was, or how big, they knew not. They consulted, therefore,
what to do, and were some time before they could resolve ; for if they fell
upon these, they must cut all their throats ; and it was ten to one but some
of them might escape, it being in the light, though the moon was up ; and if
one escaped, he would run and raise all the town, so they should have a
whole army upon them; on the other hand, if they went away and left
those untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell which
way to look for the town: however, the last was the best advice, so they
resolved to leave them, and look for the town as well as they could They
went on a little way, and found a. cow tied to a tree; this, they presently
concluded, would he a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow certainly
belonged to the town before them, or the town behind them, and if they
untied her, they should see which way she went: if she went buck, they
had nothing to say to her; but if she went forward, they would follow her.
So they cut the cord, which was made of twisted figs, and the cow went on
before them, directly to the town; which, as they reported, consisted of
above two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found several
families living together.

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep could make
them: and, first, the)r called another council, to consider what they had to

do; and presently resolved to divide themselves into three bodies, and so
419
set three houses on fire in three parts of the town; and as the men came
out, to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they need not be asked
what to do 'hen), and so to Search the rest of the houses for plunder: but
they resolved to nmmh silent-1y first through the town, and see What
dimensions it. was of, and if they might venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture upon
them: but while they were animating one another to the work. three of
them, who were a. little before the rest, called out aloud to them, and told
them, that they hads found Tom Jefi'ry : they all ran up to the place, where
they found the poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat
out. There. was an Indian house just by the tree, where they found sixteen
or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had been concerned in the fray
with us before and two or three of them wounded with our shot; and
our men found they were awake, and talking one to another in that house,
but knew not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled {zomrade so enraged them, as before,
that they sworn to one another that they would he revenged, and that. not
an Indian that crime into their hands should have any quarter; and to
work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as might. be expected
from the rage and fury they were in. Their first care was to get>> something
that would soon take fire, but, after a little search, they found that would
be to no purpose; for most of the houses were low, and thatched with
flags and rushes, of which the country is full; so they presently made
some Wildfire, us we call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their
hands, and in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five
places, and particularly that house where the Indians were not gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, _the poor frightened creature-s hogan
to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt ; and
especially at the door, where they drove them back, the boatswain himself
killing one or two with his poleaxe. The house being large, and many in
it, he did not care to go in, but called for a hand grenade, and threw it;
among them, which at first frightened them, but, when it burst, made such
huroe among them that they cried out in a. hideous manner. In short, most
of the Indians who were in the open part of the house were killed or hurt
with the grenade, except two or three more who pressed to the door, which
the himlswnin and two more kept, with their lmyonets on the muzzlcs of
their pieces, and despetched ull that came in their way ; but there was

another apartment- in the house, where the prince or king, or whatever he
42!)
was, and several others, were ; and these were kept in till the house, which
was by this time all in a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were
smothered together.

All this while they fired not a. gun, because they would not. wuken the
people faster than they could master them; but the fire began to woken
them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in
bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all the houses being made of light
combustible stuff, that they could hardly bear the street between them.
Their business was to follow the fire, for the surer execution: as fast as
the fire either forced the people out of those houses which were burning,
or frightened them out of others, our people were ready at- their doors to
knock them on the head, still calling and hellooing one to another to
remember Tom J elfry.

While this was doing, I must. confess I was very uneasy, and especially
when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being night, seemed to be
close by me. My nephew, the captain, who was mused by his men, seeing
such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the mat-ter- ms, or what
danger I was in, eSpecinlly hearing the guns too, for by this time they
began to use their fire-arms; a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind
concerning me and the supercorgo, what would become of us; and at last,
though he could ill spare any more men, yet- not knowing what exigence
we might be in, he took another boat, and with thirteen men and himself
conic ashore to me.

He was surprised to see me and the supercorgo in the boat with no
more than two men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet he
was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing; for the
noise continued, and the flame increased; in short, in was next to an
impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity to know
what had happened, or their concern for the safety of the men: in a word,
the captain told me he would go and help his men, let what would come.
I argued with him, as I did before with the men, the safety of the ship,
the danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners and merchants, &c.
and told him] and the two men would go, ancl- only see if we could at a
distance learn what was likely to be the event, and come back and tell him.
It was in vain to talk In my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before ;
he would go he said; and he only wished he had left but ten men in the
ship, for he could not think of having his men lost for want of help : he had

rather lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all; and away he went.
421
I was no more able to stay behind now, than I was to persuade them
not to go; so the captain ordered two men to row bank the pinnaee, and
fetch twelve men more, leaving the long boat at an anchor; and that, when
they came back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more come
after us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship's
company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the late
quarrel which brought this mischief on.

Being now on the march, we felt. little of the ground we trod on ; and
being guided by the fire, we kept no puth, but went directly to the place of
the flame If the noise of the guns was surprising to us before, the cries of
the poor people were now quite of another nature, and filled us with horror.
I must- confess I was never at the sucking a city, or at the taking a town by
storm. I had heard of 'Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheds, in Ireland, and
killing mun, woman, and child; and I had read of Cormt Tilly seeking the
city of Magdeburg, and cutting the threats of twenty-two thousand, of all
sexes; but I never had an idea of the thmg itself before, nor is it possible to
describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds st hearing it. However,
we went on, and at length came to the town, though there was no entering
the streets of it for the lire. The first object we met with was the ruins of
a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house was consumed ; and
just before it, plainly now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men
and three women, killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the
heap among the fire; in short, there were such instances of rage, altogether
barbarous, and of e fury something beyond what was human, that we thought
it impossible our men could be guilty of it; or, if they were the authors of
it, we thought they ought to be every one of them put to the worst of deaths.
But this was not all: we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went
on just as the fire went on -, so that we were in the utmOst confusion. We
advanced a little way further, and behold, to our astonishment, three naked
women, and crying in a most- dreodfnl manner, came flying as if they had
wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror
and consternation, with three of our English butchers in the rear, who, when
they could not overtake them, fired in among them, and one that was killed
by their shot fell down in our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to
be their enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those that
pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women;
and two of them fell down, as if already dead, with the fright

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins,
422
when I saw this ; and, I believe, had the Lhiee English sailors that pursued
them come on, I had made our men kill them all; however, we took some.
means to let the poor llym creatures know that we would not hurt. them ;
and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands
lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them
know we would; whereupon they crept altogether in a huddle close behind
us, as for protection. T 1th my men drawn up together, and, charging them
to hurt. nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and see what
devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to do, and to command
them off ; assuring them that if they stayed till daylight they would have a
hundred thousand men about their ears: I say I left them, and went among
those flying people, taking only two of our men with me; and there was,
indeed, a piteous spectaclc among them. Some of them had their feet
terribly burned with trampling and running through the fire ; others their
hands burned; ono of the women had fallen down in the fire, and was very
much burned before she could get out again ; and two or three of the men
hud cuts in their books and thighs, from our men pursuing; and another
was shot through the body, and (lied while I wus there.

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was ; but I could
not understand one word they said ; though, by signs, I perceived some of
them knew not what- was the occasion themselves. I was so terrified in my
thoughts at this outrageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went
back to my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town1
through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an end to it,
cost what it would; accordingly, us I came back to my men, I told them
my resolution, and commanded them to follow me, when, at the very
moment, came four of our men, with the huatswain at their head, roving
over heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if
they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as
loud as they could halloo; and with much ado one of them made them
hear, so that they knew who we were, and came up to us.

As soon as the hoatswain saw us, he set up a. halloo like a about of
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come; and, without waiting
tohear me, " Captain," says he, "noble captain l T am glad you are come;
we have not half done yet. Villanous, hell-hound dogs! I'll kill us many
of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head : we have sworn to spare none
of them ; we'll root out the very nation of them from the earth; " and thus

he "In on, out of breath, too, with action, and would not give us leave to
423
speak a word. At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little,
" Burbarous dog !" said I, " what are you doing? I won't have one creature .
touched more, upon pain of death: I charge you, upon your life, to stop
your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead man this minute."
---" Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, or what they have
done? If you want a. reason for what We hove done, come hither; " and
with that he showed me t 9. poor fellow hanging, with his throat cut,

T confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have been
forward enough; hut I thought they had carried their mge too for, and
remembered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi -, " Cursed he their
anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for it was crue ." But I had now
a. new task upon my hands; for when the men I carried with me saw the
sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain them as I should have
had with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told
me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the men being
overpowered; and as to the people, he thought not. one of them ought to
live ; for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man,
and that they ought- to be used like murderers. Upon these words, away
ran eight of my men, with the hoatswain and his crew, to complete their
bloody work ; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came
away pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, much less the horrible
noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercorgo and two men,
and with these Walked back to the boat. It was a. ver)r great piece of folly
in me, I confess, to venture hock as it were alone; for as it began now to
be almost day, and the alarm had run over the country, there stood about
forty men armed with lenses and bows, at the little place where the twelve
or thirteen houses stood, mentioned before; but by accident I missed the
place, and came directly to the seaside, and by the time I got to the see.--
side, it was broad day: immediately I took the pinnnce and went on board,
and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen, I observed,
about the time that I came to the boat-side, that the fire was pretty Well
out, and the noise abated ; but in about half an hour after I got on board, I
heard a volley of our men's fire-arms, and saw a. great smoke. This, as I
understood afterwards, was our men falling upon the men, who, as I said,
stood at the few houses on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or seven-
teen, ond set all the houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women or

children
424
By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace, our men
began to appear; they came dropping in, not in two bodies as they went,
but stmggling here and there in such a manner, that a small force of
resolute men might have cut them all on". But the dread of them was upon
the whole cOnntry; and the men were surprised, and so frightened, that I
believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but. five of our
men Nor in all this terrible action was there a man that made any con-
siderable defence : they were so surprised bet-ween the terror of the tire and
the sudden attack of our mcn in the dark, that they knew not which way to
turn themselves; for if they fled one way they were met by one. party. it"
back again, by another: so that. they were everywhere knocked down ; no.
did any of our men receive tho least hurt, except one that sprained his
foot, and another that had one of his hands burned.

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed, with all
the men, but. with him in particular, as well for his acting so out of his
duty, as commander of the ship, and having the change of the voyage
upon him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his blind
men, in so bloody and cruel an enterprise, My nephew answered me
very respectfully, but told me that when hr. saw the body of the poor
sccnian whom they had murdcrcd in so cruel and horburous a manner,
he was not master of himself, neither could he govern his passion; he
owned he should not have done so, as he was commander of the ship;
but us he was a man, and nature moved him, he could not bear it. As
for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me at all, and they knew
it well enough; so they took no noticc of my dislike. The next day we
set sail, so we never heard any more of it. Our men differed in the,
account of the number they had killed: but according to the host of
their accounts, put all together, they killed or destroyed about one hundred
and fifty people, men, women, and children, and left not a. house standing
in the town. As for the. poor fellow Tom Jelli'y, as he was quite dead
(for his throat was so out that his head was half oil'), it would do him
no service to bring him away; so they only took him down from the
tree where he was hanging by one hand

- However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it,
and I always. alter that time, told them God would blast the voyage;
for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be murder in
them. For though it is true that they had killed Tom Jefi'ry, yet Jem'y

was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had ill-used a young woman
42E 3 L
of theirs, who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the
public capitnlntion.

The hoatswain defended this quarrel when we were alterwards on board.
He said it was true that we seemed to break the truce, but really had
not; and that the war was begun the night before by the natives them-
selves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our men without any just
provocation; so that as we were in a captioity to fight them now, we
might also be in a mpaoily to do ourselves justice upon them in an
extraordinary manner; that though the poor man had taken a little
liberty \rifh the girl. he ought not to hare been murdered, and that in
such a. \r'illz'inous manner; and that they (lid nothing but what was just
and what the laws of Gorl allowed to he done to murderers. One
would think this should have been enough to have warned us against
going on shore amongst heathons and barbarians; but it is impossible
to make mankind wise but at their own expense, and their experience
seems to be always of most use to them when it. is dearest bought.

"'9. were now hound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the
coast of Commando], only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the
supernargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal; where if he missed his
business outward-bound, he was to go out to China, and return to the
coast as he came home. The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf
of Persia. where five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian
side of the gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed,
or carried away into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able
to rescue 1.hem_.and bad but just time to got oil" their boat. I began 1:0

' upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven in this case; but the
boatswuin very warmly told me, he thought I went further in my
censor-es than I could show any warrant for in Scripture; and referred
to Luke xiii. 4-, where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom
the Tower of Siloznn fell were not sinners above all the Gnlileans;
but that which put me lo silence in the case was, that not one of these
five men who were now lost were of those who went. on shore to the
nmssam'rj of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could
not hear to hear the word nus-same with any patience.

But my frequent preaehing to them on this subject had worse con-
sequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the hood
of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me he found

that I brought that affair continually upon the stage; that i made unjust
426
reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on that account, and
himself in particular; that as .T was hut a passenger, and had no com-
mand in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to
bear it; that they did not know but I might have. some ill design in my
head, and perhaps to call them to an account. for it when they came to
England; and that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have done with
it, andolso not to concern myself any further with him, or any of his
affairs, he would leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with
me among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him that
I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, and that
I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not more
upon him than any of the rest; that as to having no command in the
ship, that was true ; nor did I exercise any authority, only took the Liberty
of speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all ; and what
concern I had in the voyage was none of his business; that I was a
considerable owner in the ship In that claim, I conceived I had a right
to speak even further than I had done, and would not>> be accountable to
him or any one else, and begun to be a little warm with him. He made-
but little reply to me at that time, and I thought the affair had been over.
We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being willing to see
the place, I went on shore with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert
myself; and towards. evening was preparing to go on board, when one
of the men came to me, and told me he would not have me trouble myself
to come down to the boot, for they had orders not to curry me on heard
any more. Any one may guess what a. surprise I was in at so insolcnt
a message; and I asked the man, who bade him deliver that message
to me? He told me the coxswain.

I immediately found out the supercargo, and told him the story, adding,
that I foresaw them would he a. mutiny in the ship ; and entreated him to
go immediately .on heard and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have
spared this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore, the matter
was effected on board. The lioetawain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all
the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone oil" in the boat, came up, and
desired to speak with the captain ; and then the hoatswein, making a long
horanguc, and repeating all he had said to me, told the captain that as l was
now gone peaceably on shore, they were 10th to use any violence with me,
which, if I had not gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to

PS27
oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought fit, to tell him, that as
they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his onnnnand, they
would perform it well and faithfully: but if I would not quit the. ship,
or the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail
no further with him; and at that word all, he turned his face towards the
maimnast', which was, it seems, a signal agreed on, when the seamen, being
got together there, cried out, " 0m:- and all ! one. and all I "

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great. presence of
mind; and though he was surprised, yet he told them calmly that he
would consider of the matter; but that he could do nothing in it till he. had
spoken to me about. it. He used some arguments with them, to show them
the nnreasonuhleness and injustice of the thing--but it. was all in vain;
they swore, and shook hands round before his face, that they would all
go on shore, unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come
any more on heard the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me, and
did not know how I might take it. So he began to talk smartly to them;
told them that I was a very considerable owner of the ship, and that if
ever they came to England again, it. would cost them very dear; that. the
ship was mine, and that he could not put. me out of it; and that he would
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than disoblige me so much; so
they might do as they pleased. However, he wouldgo on shore and talk
with me, and invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might
accon'imodate the matter with me But they all rejected the proposal, and
said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and if I came on
hoard, they would all go on shore. "' Well," said the captain, " if you are
all of this mind, let me go on shore and tall: with him." So away he
came to me with this account, a little after the message had heen brought
to me from the coxswain.

l was very glad to see my nephew, I must. confess; for l was not
without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set sail,
and run away with the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in :1
remote country, having nothing to help myself; in short, I had been in
a" worse case than when I was alone in the island. But they had not
come to that length, it- seems, to my satisfaction; and when my nephew
told me what they had said to him, and how they had sworn and shook
hands that they would, one and all, leave the ship, if I was suffered to

come on board, I told him he should not he concerned at it at all, for I
428
would stay on shore. I only desired he would take care and send me
all my necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of money,_
and I would find my way to England as well as I could. This was a
heavy piece of news to my nephew, but. there was no way to help it but
to comply; so, in short, he went on board the ship again, and satisfied
the men that his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had sent
for his goods from on board the ship; so that the matter was over in a
few hours, the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what
course I should steer.

I was now alone in a most remote part of the world, for I was near-
three thousand leagues by sea farther off from England, than 1 was at
my island; only, it is true, I might. travel here by land over the Great
Mogul's country to Surat, might, go from thence to llassora by sea, up the
Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the Desert of"
Arabia, to Aleppo and Scandemon; from thence by sea again to Italy,

. and so overland into l-'mnca Iliad another way before me, which was to
wait for some English ships, which were coming to Bengal from thin, on
the Island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England. But.
as I came hither without any ooncern with the East- India Company, so it
would be difficult to go from hence without their licence, unless with great
favour of the captains of the ships, or the company's factors; and to hath
I was an utter stranger.

Here I had the umriiiioation to see the Ship set sail Without. me ; however,
my nephew left- me two servants, or rather, one companion and one servant. ;
the first was clerk to the purse-r, whom he engaged to go with me, and the
other was his own servant. I then took a good lodging in the house of an
Englishwoman, where several merchants lodged, some French, two Italians,
or rather Jews, and one Englishman. Here I stayed above nine months,
considering What. course to take. I had some English goods with me of
value, and a considerable sum of money; my nephew furnishing me with
a thousand pieces-oficighi, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion,
that I might not be straitencd, whatever might happen. I quickly disposed
of my goods to advantage; and, as I originally intended, I bought here-
some very good diamonds, which, of all other things, were the most proper
for me in' my present circumstances, because I could always carry my
Whole estate about me.

During my stay here, many proposals weie inade- for my return to.
England, but none falling out to my mind, the English. merchant>> who-

429
lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance
with, come to me one nun-mug. saying: " Countryman, 1 have a project to
communicate, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for ought I know,
suit with yams also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it. Here
we are posted, you by accident, and l by my own choice, in a part of the
world very remote from our own wuntry; but it is in a country where, by
us, who understand trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got.
if you will put one thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will
hire n ship here, the first we can get to our minds. You shall he captain,
I'll be merchant, and we'll go a. trading voyage to China; for what should
we stand still for? The whole world is in motion ; why should we be idle?"

I liked this proposal very well; and the more so because it seemed to
he expressed with so much good will. In my loose, unhinged circumstances,
T was the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade. or indeed anything else.
I might perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not my element,
rambling was 3 and no psoposnl for seeing any purl; of the world which I
had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me. It was, however,
some time before we could get a ship to our minds. and when we had got a
vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many as
were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we
should pick up there. Alter some time we. got a mate, a boatswain, and a
gunner, English ; :1 Dutch carpenter, and three foremost men. With these
we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they
were, to make up

When all was ready we set sail for Achin, in the island of Sumatra,
and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for opium
and some arrack', the first a conunodity which bears a great price among
the Chinese, and which, at- tlmt time, was much wanted there. Then we
went up to Suskan, were e'ght months out, and on our return to Bengal 1
was very well satisfied with my adventure. Our people in England often
admire how officers, which the Company send into India, and the merchants
which generally stay there, get such very great estates as they do, and
sometimes come home wofih sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time;
but. it is little matter for wonder, when we consider the innumemble ports
and places where they have 21 free commerce; indeed, at the perts where
the English ships come, there is such great and constant demands for the
growth of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for the returns, as

well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.
430
I got so much money by my first adventure, and such an insight into
the method of getting more, that had I been twenty years younger, I should
have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no farther for making
any fortune; but what was all this to a man upwards of t-ln'eescorc, that
was rich enough, and cuxne abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of
seeing the world than a covctons desire of gaining by it? A restless
desire it really was, for when I was at home, I was restless to go abroad,
and when I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say, what was
this gain to me? I was rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy dcsircs.
about getting more money; therefore the profit of the voyage to me was
of no great force for the prompting '1110 forward to further undertakings.
Hence, I thought- that by this voyage I had made no progress at all, because-
I was come back, as I might call it, to the place them whence T came, as
to a home: whereas, my eye, like that which Solomon speaks of, was never-
satisfied with seeing. I was come into a. part of the world which I was
never in before, and that part, in particular, which I had heard much of,
and was resolved to see as much of it as I could: and then I thought I
might say 1 had seen all the world that was worth seeing.

But my fellowtmvcller and T had different notions: l acknowledge
his were the more suited to the end of a. merchant's life: who, when he is
abroad upon adventures, is wise to stick to that, as the. best thing for him,
which he is likely to get the most money by. On the other hand, mine-
was the notion of a mad, rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing
twice over. But this was not all: I had .1 kind of impatience upon me to
he nearer homo, and yet an unsettled resolution which way to go. In the
interval of these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search
for business, proposed another voyage. among the Spice Islands, to bring
home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.

W'c were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty
was in bringing me to come into it. However, at last, nothing else ofi'ering,
and as sitting still, to me especially, we: the nnha'ppiost part of life, I
resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully, touching at
Borneo, and several other islands, and came home in about five months,
when we sold our spices, with very great. profit, to the Persian merchants,
who carried them uwny to the gulf. My friend, when we made up this.
account, smiled at me: " Well, now," said he, with a. sort of friendly
rebuke on my indolent- temper, "is not this better than walking about. here,
like a. man with nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at the:

431
nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?"--"\\-'hy, truly," said I, "my
friend, I think it is, and I begin to he a convert to the principles of
merchandising; but I must tell you, by the way, you do not know what I
am doing; for if I once conquer my backwarelness, and embark heartily,
old as I mn,l shall harass you up and down the world till I the you;
for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let. you lie still."

A little while after this there came in a. Dutch ship from liatavia; she
was it coaster, not an European trader, of about two hundred tons burden;
the men, as they pretended, having been so sickly that the captain had not
hands enough to go to sea with, so he lay by at Bengal; and having, it
seems, got money enough, or being' willing, for other reasons, to go for
Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his ship. This name to my
ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to bu)r it;
so 1 went to him and told him of it. He considered awhile, for he was
no rash man neither; and at last replied, " She is a little too big--however,
we will have her." Accordingly, we. bought the ship, and agreeing with
the master, we paid for her, and took possession. When we had done so
we resolved to engage the men, if we could, to join with those we had, for
the pursuing our business; but, on a. suddcn, they having received not
their wages, but their share of the money, as we afterwards learned, not
one of them was to be found; we inquired much about them, and at length
were told that the)r were all gone together by land to Agni, the great city
of the Moguls residence, to proceed from thence to Surat, and then go by
sea, to the Gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a. good while, as that I should miss
the opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I thought, and in
such company as would both have guarded and diverted me, would have
suited mightily with my great design; and I should have both. soon the
world, and gone homeword too. But I was much better satisfied 9. few
days after, when i came to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in
short, their history was, that this man the)r called captain was the gunner
only, not. the commander; that they had been a. trading voyage, in which
they had been attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed
the captain and three of his men; and that; after the captain was killed,
these men, eleven in number, having resolved to run away with the ship,
brought. her to Bengal, leaving the mole. and five men more on shore

Well, let them got the ship how they would, we came honestly by her,

as we thought, though we did not. I confess, examine into things so
432
exactly as we might ; for we. never inquired anything of the seamen.
who would certainly have faltered in their account, and contradicted one
another. Somehow or other we should have had reason to have suspected
them; but the man showed us a hill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel
Clostershoven, or some such name, for 1 suppose it was all a (big-em and
called himself by that name, and We could not contradict him: and withal,
having no suspicion of the thing, we went through with our bargain.
We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some. Dutch ;
and now we resolved on a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &e.;
that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucea, isles. In short, not to
fill up this part of my story with titles, when what is to come is so
remarkable, I spent, fmm'first to last, six years in this country, trading
from port to port, backward and forward, and with very good success, and
was now the last year With my new partner, going in the ship above
mentioned, on a. voyzue to China, but designing first to go to Siam, to
buy rice,

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and down a
great while in the Straits ol' Malacca, and among the islands, we were no
sooner got clear of those difficult seas, than we found our ship had sprung a
look, but could not discover where it was. This forced us to make some
port ; and my partner, who knew the country hotter than I did, directed the
captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for I had made the English mate,
one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge of the ship
upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the great My 01- gulf
which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman a gunner's mateon
board an English East--India. ship, then riding in the same river. " Sir," says
he, addressing mo, " you are a stranger on me, and Ito you ; but. I have some-
thing to tell you that very nearly concerns you, I am moved by the imminent
danger you are in, and, for anght I see, you have no knowledge of it."--" I
know no danger l aim in," said I, " but that my ship is leaky, and 1 cannot
find it- out; but I intend to lay her aground tomorrow, to see if I can find
it."---" But, sir," says he, " leaky or not leaky, yea will be wiser than to lay
your ship on shore tomorrow, when you hear what. T have to say to you.
Do you know, sir," said he, " the town of Cambodia. lies about fifteen leagues
up the river; and there are two large English ships about five leagues on
this side, and three Dntch?"--"\Vell," said T, "and what is that to me? "--

" "my. sir," Said he, " is it for it man that is upon such adventures as you
433 3 K
are, to come into a port, and not examine first what ships there are there,
and whether he is able to deal with them Z I suppose you do not think you
are a match for them? " I could not conceive what he meant ; and I turned-
short upon him, and said: "I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot
imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of the Company's ships, or'
Dutch ships. I am no interloper. What can they have to say to me?"
" Well, sir," says he, with a. smile, "if you think yourself secure, you must
take your chance ; but, take my advice, if you do not put to sea immediately,
you will the very next. tide be attacked by five long-boats full of men, and
perhaps, if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars
be examined afterwards. I thought, sir," added he, "I should have met
with a better reception than this, for doing you'n. piece of service of such
importance."--" I can never be ungrateful," said I, 'i for any service, or to
unyman that ofiers me any kindness; but it is past my comprehension what
they should have such 'a design upon me for: however, since you say there
is no time to be lost, and that there is some villanous design on hand against
me, I will go on board this minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men
can stop the leak _: but, sir," said I, " shall I go away ignorant of the cause of
all this? Can you give me no further light into it i"

" 1 can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he ; " but I have a. Dutch
seamen hem with me, and I believe I could persuade him to tell you the
rest; but there is scarce time for it. But the short of the story is this--
the first part of which I suppose you know well enough--that you were
with this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain was murdered by the.
Malays, with three of his men ; and that you, or some of those that were on
board with you, ran away with tho ship, and are since turned Pirates This
is the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as pirates, I can assure
you, and executed with very little ceremony; for you know merchant ships
show but little law to pirates, if they get them into their power."--" Now
you speak plain English," said I, " and 1 thank you; and though I know
nothing that we have done like what you talk of, for I am sure we came
honestly and fairly by the ship; yet seeing such a work is doing, as you
say, and that you seem to mean honestly,l will be upon my gunr ."--" Nay,
sir," says he, " do not talk of being upon your guard ; the best defence is to be
out of danger. If you have any regard for your life, and the lives of all
your men, put to see without fail at high water; and as you have a whole
tide before you, you Will be gone too for out before they can come down ;

for they will come away at high water, and as they have twenty miles to

come, you will get- near two hours of them by the difference of the tide, not
reckoning the length of the way: besides, as. they are unly boats, and not
ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to sea, especially if it,
blowsf'--"Woll," said I, "you have been very kind in this : what shall I do
to make you amends ?"--4--" Sir," says he, "' you may not. be willing to make
me any amends, because you may not be convinced of the truth of it. I will
make an 00hr to you: I have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the
ship -----, which 1 came out. of England in ; and the Dutchman that is with
me has sumn months' pay due. to him. If you will. make good our pay to
us, we will go along with you ; if you find nothing more in it, we will desire:
no more _; hut if we do convince you that we have saved yum- lives. and the
ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave the rest to you."

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and the two

men with me As soon as 1 came to Lhe ship's side, my partner, who was
435 -
on board, came out. on the quarter--deck, and called to me, with a grant deal
of joy, " We have stopped the leak--we have stopped the ieak ! ">>----" Say you
so," said l ; " thank God ! but weigh anchor, then, immediately."--~" "'cigh l"
says he; " what do you mean by that? What is the matter? "--"Ask no
quest-ions," said I ; "but set all hands to work, and weigh Without. losing a.
minute." He was surprised ; however, he culled the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to he got up ; and though the tide was not
quite down, yet a little land-broom blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I
called him into the cabin, and told him the story ; and we culled in the men,
and they told us the rest of it; hut as it Look up a great deal of time, before
we had done, a scuman come! to the cabin door, and culled out to us that
the captain hude him tell us we were chased by five sloops, or hoot-s, full of
men."--" Very well," said 1, "then it. is apparent there is something in it."
I then ordered all our men to he called up, and told them there was a design
to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them if they would
stand by us, and by one another; the men unswered cheerfully, one and all,
thut. they would live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way
he thought host for us to manage a fight. with them ; for resist. them I was
resolved we would, and that w the last drop. He said readily, that the way
was to keep ihcm oll' with our great shot as long as we could, and then to
:usc our small urine, to keep them from boarding us: but, when neither of
these would do any longer, we would retire to our close quarters, for perhaps
they had noL umtcrials to break open our bulkheads, or get in upon us.

The gunner had in the mean time, orders to hring two guns to hear fore
and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and loud them with musket-
bullets and small pieces of old iron, and what Cildlle next. to hand. Thus
we made ready for light; but all this while we kept: out to sea, with wind
enough, and could see the boats at a distance, heing live large long-heals,
following us wirh' all the sail they could make.

Two of those boats (which by our glosses we could see. were English]
outsailecl the rest. Were near two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon
us considerably, so that we found they would come up with us ', upon which
we fired a. gun without bull, to intimate that they should bring to : and we
put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley: but, they came crowding alter
us, till within shot. When we tool; in our white flag. they having made no
answer to it, and hung out. a red flag, and fired at them With a shot. Notr
withstanding this, they cume on till they were near enough to call to them

with a spcuking-tmmpet, bidding them keep off at their Deri'
436
It was all one ; they crowded ufier us, and endeavoured to come under
our stem, so as to board us on our quarter ; upon which, seeing they were
resolute for mischief, and depended upon the strenglh that followed them, I
ordered to brig the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside; when
immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which had been levelled so
true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat, and we then forced
them to take down their sail, and to run all to the head of the boat, to keep
her from sinking 3 so she lay by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the foremost
bout crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular. While
this was doing, one at the three boats that followed made up to the hoot
which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see her (eke out the
men. We then called again to the foremost boat, and offered a truce, to
pmle ' again, and to know what her business was with us; hut had no
answer, only she crowded close under our stern. Upon this, our gunner,
who was a very dexterousz. fellow, run out his two case-guns, and fired again
at her, but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their caps,
and came on. The gunner, getting quicklyr ready again, fired among them .
a second time, one shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, yet fell
in among the men, and we could easil)r see did a great deal of mischief
among them. We now were the ship again, and brought our quarter to
bear upon them, and firing three guns more, we found the boat was almost
split to pieces ; in particular, her rudder and a. piece of her stern were shot
quite away ; so they handed her sail immediz'ztely, and were in great disorder.
To complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again;
where he hit thorn we could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking,
and some of the men already in the water: upon this, I inunediutoly
manned out our pinnace, with orders to pick up some of the men, if they
oculd, and save them from drowning, and immediately come on board ship
with them, because we saw the rest of the boats begun to come up. Our
men in the pinnace followed their orders, and took up three men, one of
whom was just drowning, and it was a. good while before we could recover
him. As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the sail we could
make, and stood further out to the sea _: and we found that when the other
boats omne up to the first, tho}T gave over their chase.

Being thus delivered from a. danger, which, though I knew not the reason
of it. yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended, I resolved that we
should change our course, and not let any one know whither we were going:

so we stood out to sea. onstn-nrd, quite out. of the course of all European
487
ships, whether they were bound to China or anywhere else, within the
commerce of the European nations. When we were at sea, we began to
consult with the two seamen, and inquire what the meaning of ltll this
should he ; and the Dutchmen confirmed the gunner's story, about the false
sale of the ship and of the murder of the captain, and also how that; he,
this Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where they wondered
about a great while, till at length he made his escape, and swam off to a
Dutch ship, which was sailing near the shore in its way from China.

He then told us that ho went to Batavia, where two of the. seamen
belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels, and
gave an account that the fellow who had run awuy with the ship sold her
at Bengal to n. so": of pirates, who were gone a-cruizing in her, and that they
had already taken on English ship and two Dutch ships very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly, though we knew it. to be
false ', yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their hands,
and they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it had been
in vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter
at their hands ; especially considering that our accuscrs had been our judges,
and that we could have expected nothing from them but what rngc would
have dictated, and an ungoverned passion have executed. Therefore it was
his opinion we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came,
without. putting in at any port wlmicver,--bceausc there we could give a
good account of ourselves, could prove where we were when the ship put in,
of whom we bought her, and the like; and, whut- was more than all the
rest, if we were put upon the necessity of bringing it before the proper
judges, we should he sure to have some justice, and not. to be hanged first,
and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but after a little more serious
thinking, I told him I thought- it was a very great hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of
Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, We should he sure to be way-"laid
on every side :--that if we should be taken, us it were running away, we
should even condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he was of my
mind, and that we should certainly be taken. This (longer a. little startled
my partner, and all the ship's company, and we immediately resolved to go
away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China,--and,

pursuing the first design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of
Ass
the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the country, such as we
could get. This was approved of as the best method for our security ; and
accordingly we'st'ccred away NILE keeping above fifty leagues off from the
usual course to the eastward. This, however, put us to some inconvenience:
for, first, the winds, when we came that distance from the shore, seemed to
be more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the E.
and ENE. so that we were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but
ill provided with victunls for so long a run ; and, What was still u'orse,'there
was some danger that those Erglish and Dutch ships, whose bouts pursued
us, whereof some were bound that way, might have got in before us, and if '
not, some other ship bound to China might have information of us from
them, and pursue us with the some vigour.

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, including
the late escape from the long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous
condition that ever I was in through my past life; for whatever ill circum--
stances I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief before; nor had I
ever done anything that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much
less thievish. I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say,
1 had been nobody's enemy but my' own; but now I was wofully embar-
rassed; for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make
that innocence appear ; and if I had been taken, it had been under a,
supposed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to make an
escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or place we
could go to. My partner endeavoured to encourage 1110 by describing the
several ports of that coast, and told me he would'put in on the coast of
Cochin China, or the Bay of Tonquin, intending afterwards to go to Macao,
where a great many European families resided--and particularly the mis-
sionary priests, who usually went thither in order to their going forward
to China

Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though after a tedious
course, and very much straitened for provisions, we came within sight of the
coast very early in the morning; and upon reflection on the past circum-
stances of danger we were in, we resolved to put into a. small river, which,
however, had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we could, either
overland or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any
port thereebouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance : for though
we did not immediately see any European ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet.

the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch ships ; and a third
439
without any colours Spread out, but which we believed to be a. Dutchman,
passed by at about two lcngnes' distunce, steering for the coast of China;
and in the ufternoon went by two English ships steering the same course;
and thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies both one way and
the other. The place we were in was wild and barbarous,'~the people
thieves by occupation ; and though. it is true, we had not much to seek of
them, and, except getting a. few provisions, cored not- how little we had to
do with them, yet. it was with much difficulty that we kept ourselves from
beinglinsnlted by them several ways. We Were in a small river of this
country, within 21 few leagues of its utmost limits northward ; and by our
boat we coasted north-east, to the point. of land which opens the great bay
of Tonqnin; and it was in this beating up along the shore that we dis--
covered we were surrounded with enemies. The people we were among
were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast, andornong
other customs, they have this one : that if any vessel has the misfortune to
be shipwrecked upon their coast, they lllztke the men all prisoners or slavw ;
and it was not long before we fornid a spice of their kindness this way, on
the occasion following.

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a look at son, and that we
could not find it out; and it happened that, as ] have said, it was stopped
unexpectedly, on the eve of our being pursued by the Dutch, and English
ships in the Bay of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound us we desired, we resolved while we were at this place to
lay her on shore, and clean her bottom, and, if possible, to find out. where
the leaks wem. Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all
our guns and other movables to one side, we tried to bring her down, that
we night come at her bottom ; but, on second thoughts, we did not care to
lay her on dry ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants conic wondering down the shore to look at us; and
seeing the ship lie dmvn on one side in such it manner, and hccliug in
towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on her
bottom with stages, and with their boats on the off-side, they presentiy
concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on the ground. On
this supposition, they came about us in two or three hours' time with ten
or twelve large bouts, having some of them eight, some ten men in a. bent,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the ship, and if
they found us there, to have curried us away for slaves.

When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, they
in)
diScoverad us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and side,
washing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little surprised,
could not imagine what their design was; but being willing to be sine, we
took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and others to hand
down arms and ammunition to those that were at work, to defend them-
selves with, if there should he occasion, And it was no more than need:
for in less than a quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems,
that the ship was really a wreck, and that we were all at work endeavouring
to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; andwhon we
handed our arms into the boat, they concluded, by that act, that we were
endeavouring to save some of our goods; upon this, they took it for
granted we all belonged to them, and away they come directly upon our
men, as if it had been in a line-of-battde. _

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to no frightened, for we lay
but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what they should
do. I immediately called to the men that. worked upon the stages, to slip
them down, and get up the side into the ship, and hadc those in the boat
to row round and come on board The few who were on board worked
with all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights; how--
ever, neither the men upon the stages nor those in the boats could do as
they were ordered, before the Cochin Chinese were upon them, when two
of their boats boarded our long-hoot, and began to lay hold of the men as
their prisoners.

The first man they laid hold of was an English seanmn, a. stout, strong
fellow, who having a musket. in his hand, never ofl'ercd to fire it, hut laid
it down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought; but. he understood his
business better than I could teach him, for he grappled the Pagan, and
dragged him by main force out- of their boat into mus, where, taking him
by the. ems, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow
died in his hands. In the mean time, a Dutchman, who stood next, took
up the musket, and with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he
knocked down five of them who attempted to enter the boat But this
was doing little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless because
ignorant of their danger, hogan to throw themselves into the long-host,
where we had but. live men in all to defend it; but th'e lhllowing accident,
which deserved our laughter, gave our men a. complete victory.

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as well

441 3 L
as to pay the seams where he had caulked her to stop the leaks, had got
two kettles just let down into the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and
the other with resin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff as the ahipwrights use
for that work; and the man that attended the carpenter had a great iron
ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the men that were at work with
the hot stuff. Two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this
fellow stood in the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted them with a ladle-
full of the stuff, boiling hot, which so horned and scolded them, being half-
naked, that they roared out like bulls. and, enraged with the fire, leaped
both into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, " Well done, Jack .
give them some more of it:" and stepping forward himself, takes one of
the mops, and clipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among
them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the three boats, there
was not one that escaped being scalded in a most frightful manner, and
made such a howling and crying, that 1 never heard a worse noise.

1 was never better pleased with a victory in my life ; not only as it was
a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was imminent before, but as
we got this victory without any bloodshed, except of that man the seamen
killed with his naked hands, and which T was very much concerned at.
Although it may he a just thing, because necessary (for there is no
neeeseary wickedness in nature), yet I thought it was a sad sort of life,
when we must he always obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to
preserve ourselvesfand, indeed, I think so still; and lwould even now
suffer a great deal, rather than I would take away the life even of the worst
person injuring me; and I believe all considering people, who know the
value of life, would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the
consideration of it;

All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest
of the men on board, had with great dexterity hrought the ship almost to
rights, and having got the guns into their places again, the gunner called
to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among them.
I called back again Lo him, and hid him not ofl'er to fire, for the carpenter
would do the work without him; but hid him heat another pitch--kettle,
which our oook, who was on board, took care of. However, the enemy was
so terrified with what they had met with in their first attack, that they
would not come on again; and some of them who were farthest off. swing
the ship swim, as it- were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see their

mistake, and gave over the enterprise, finding it was not as they expected
442
Thus we got clear of this merry fight; and having got some rice, and some
roots and bread, with about sixteen bags, on board, two days before, we
l'eSOlVUd to stay here no longer, but go fin-ward, whatever came of it; for
we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day with rogues
enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. We
therefore. got all our things on board the some evening, and the next
morning were ready to sail: in the mean time, lying at anchor at some
distance from the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now in a
fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy hud prev
sented. The next day, having finished our work within board, and finding
our ship was perfectly healed of all her looks, we set sail. We would have
gone into the Bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what
was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that had ,been there; but we
durst. not stood in there, because we had seen several ships go in, as we
supposed, but a. little before; so we kept on SE. towards the island of
Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by v. Dutch or English merchant
ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an
Alger-inc inan-of-war.

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on NFL, us if we would go to
the Monillus or the Philippine Islands; and this we did that we might. not
fall into the way of any of the European ships; and then we steered north,
till we came to the latitude of 22deg 30' by which means we made the island
of Formosa directly, where we come to an anchor, in order to get water and
fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very courteous in their
manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually
with us in all their agreements and bargains. This is what we did not find
umong other people, and may he owing to the remains of Christianity which
was once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testi-
mony of what I have often observed, viz, that the Christian religion always
civilizes the people, and reforms their manners, where it is received,
whether it works saving effects upon them or no.

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an
equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all. the ports of China. where
our European ships usually come; being resolved, if possible, not to fall
into any of their hands, especially in this country, where, as our circum--
stances were, we could not fail of being entirely ruined, Being now come
to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved to put into the first trading port

we should come at; and standing in for the shore, a. boat come all" two

leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowing us to be
an European ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were glad of
and took him on board; upon which, without asking us whither We would,
go, he dismissed the bout he came in, and sent it buck. I thought it. was
now so much in our choice to make the old mun carry us whither we would,
that I began to talk to him about carrying us to the Gulf of Nnnkin, which
is the most northern part of the coust of China. The old man suid he knew
the Gulf of Nankiu very well; but smiling, asked us what we would do
there? T told him we would sell our cargo and purchase Chino Wares,
calicoes, row silks, tea, wrought silks, &e.; and so would return by the
same course we come. He told us our best port would havehcen to put in
at Macao, Where we could not have failed of a market for our opium Lo our
satisfaction, and might- for our money have purchased all sorts of China
goods as cheap as we could at. Nankiu

Not being able to put the 'old man out of his talk, of which he was very
opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well as mer-
chants, and that we had a. mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and
the famous court of the monarch of China. " W'hy, then," says the old
man, " you should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the
sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the great canal. This canal
is a navigable stream, which goes through the heurt of that vast empire of
China, crosses all the rivers, posses some considerable hills by the help of
sluice-s and gates, and goes up to the city of l'ekin, being in length near two
hundred and seventy leagues." " Well," said I, " Seignior Portuguese, but,
that is not: oru' business now 3 the great question is, if you can carry us up
to the city of Nnnlrin, from whence we can travel to Pokin afterwards?"
He said he could do so very well, and that there was a great DuLch ship
gone up that way just before. This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch
ship was now our terror, and we had much rather have met the devil, at
least if he hurl not come in loo frightful a figure; and we depended upon it
that a. Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no condition to
fight them; all the ships they tmdc with into those parts being of great
burden, and of much greater force than we were.

The old man found me a. little confused, and under some concern when
he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, " Sir, you need be under no appre-
hensions of the Dutch ; I suppose they are not now at war with your
notion?" " No," said I, " that's true; but I know not what liberties men

may take when they are out of the reach of the laws of their own country."
444mm: hummus m2 cmmmun or In: em.

" Why," says he, " you are no pirates ; what- nced you fear? They will not
meddle with peaceablc merchants, sure." These words put me into the
greatest. disorder and confusion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to
conceal it so, but the 01d man easily perceived it.

" Sir," says he, " I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts at my
talk; pray be pleased to go which way you think fit, and depend upon it,
I'll do you all the service I can." Upon this we fell into further discourse,
in which, to my alarm and amazement, he spoke of the villanous doings of a
certain pirate ship that'hud long been the talk of mariners in those seas;

no other, in a word, than the very ship he was now on board of, and which
445
we had so unluckily purchased. T presently saw there was no help for it
but to tell him the plain truth, and cxpluiu all the danger and trouble we
had suffered through this misadventure, and, in particular, our earnest wish
to be speedily quit of the ship altogether: for whieh reason we had resolved
to carry her up to Nankin.

,The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were in the
right to go away to the north; and that, if he might advise us, it should he
to sell the ship in China, which we might well do, and buy or build
enothcr in the country; adding, that I should meet with customers enough
for the ship at Nankin, that a. Chinese junk would serve me very well to
go back again; and that he would procure me people both to buy one and
sell the other. "Well, but, seignior," said I, "as you say they know the
ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrumental to
bring some honest, innocent men into a terrible broil; for wherever they
find the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by proving this was
the ship."--" Why," says the old man, " T'Il find out a. way to prevent that ;
for us I know all those commanders you speak or very well, and shall see
them all as they pass by, 1 will be sure to set them to rights in the thing,
and let them know that they had been so much in the wrong; that though
the people who were on board at first might run away with the ship, yet it
was not true that they had turned pirates ; and that, .in particular, these
were not the men that {inst went oil' with the ship, but innocently bought
her for their trade; and I am persuaded they will so for believe me, as at
least to act more cautiously 'for the time to come."

In about thirteen days' sail we came to an anchor, at the south-west
point of the. great Gulf of Xenkin 3 where I learned by accident that two
Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that I should certainly
fall into their hands. I consulted my partner again in this exigeney, and
he was as much at a loss as I was. I then asked the old pilot if there was
no creek or harbour which I might put into and pursue my business with
the Chinese privately, and he in no danger of the enemy. He told me if I
would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues, there was a little
port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually landed
from Meeuo, on their progress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese,
and where no European ships ever put in ; and if I thought to put in there,
I might consider what further course to take when I was on shore. He
confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants, except that at some

certain times they had a kind of a. fair there, when the merchants from
446
Japan came over thither to buy Chinese merchandises. The name of the
port I may perhaps spell wrong, having lost this, together with the names
of many other places set down in a little pocket--book, which was spoiled
by the water by an accident; but this I remember, that the Chinese
merchants we cou'cspondcd with called it by a. difi'erent name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, who pronounced it Quinchang. As we
were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed the next
day, having only gone twice on shore where We were, to get fresh water; on
both which occasions the people of the country were very civil, and brought
abimdanee of provisions to sell to us: but nothing without money.

We did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary) for five
days ; but it was very much to our satisfaction, and I was thankful, when I
set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible
to dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, though not profitably, we
would never more set foot on board that unhappy vessel. Indeed, I must
acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of life that ever I had any
experience of, nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of
being in constant fear. Well (lees the Scripture say, "The fear of man
brings a snare: " it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely oppressed
by it, that it is capable of no relief.

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by heightening
every danger; representing the English and Dutch captains to be men
incapable of hearing reason, or of distinguishing between honest man and
rogues: or between a story calculated for our own turn, made out of
nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole
voyage, progress, and design; for we might many ways have convinced any
reasonable creatures that we were not pirates; the goods we had on board.
the course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such
and such ports; and even our very nunmer, the force we had, the number
of men, the few arms, the little ammunition, short provisions; all these
would have served to convince any men Lhat we were no pirates. The
opium and other goods we had on board would make it appear the ship had
been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the names of all the
men that were in the ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of
English, Portuguese, and lndia11s,a.nd but two Dutchmen on board. These,
and many other particular circumstances, might have made it evident to
the understanding of any commander, whose hands we might fall into, that

we were no pirates.
447
But fear, that blind useless passion,'worked another way,-and throw us
into the vapours ; it bewildered our understandings, and set the imagination
at Work to form a thousand terrible things that perhaps might never happen.
We first supposed, as indeed everybody had related to us, that the seamen
on board the Eglish and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so
enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our heating ofi' their boats
and escaping, that. they would not give themselves leave to inquire whether
we were pirates or no, but would execute us off hand, without giving us
any'wom for a defence. We reflected that there really was so much
apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce inquire after any
more; as, first, that the ship was certainly the some, and that some of the
seamen among them knew her, and had been on board her; and, secondly,
that when we had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they were
coming down to examine us, we fought their boats and iled. Therefore we
made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we
were satisfied of the contrary; and, as I often said, T know not but I should
have been apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence, if the tables
were turned, and my case was theirs; and have made no sample of cutting
all the (new to pieces, without believing, or perhaps considering what they
might have to offer in their dcl'encc.

But- let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions; and hoth my
partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard-
arms; of fighting, and being taken; of killing, and being killed: and one
night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck
my double fist. against the side of the cabin I lay in with such a. three as
wounded my hand grievously, broke my knuckles, and out and bruised the
flesh, so that it awaked me out of my sleep. Another apprehension I had
was, the cruel usage we might meet with from them if we fell into their
hands : then the story of Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch
might perhaps torture us, as they did our countrymen there, and make some
of our men, by extremity of torture, confess to crimes they never were
guilty of, or own themselves and all of us to be pirates, and so they would
put us to death with a. formal appearance of justice; and that they might
be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo, worth altogeth'eo
four or five thousand pounds. We did not consider that the captains of
ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners

to them, they could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but would
448clwwa lax-mum m nu. an my: mun.

be accountable for it when they came to their 001mm. However, if they

were to not thus with us, what advantage would it be to us that they should

be culled to an aamunt- for it'l--or if we were first to be murdered, what

satisfaction would it- be to us to have them punished when they came home?

I cannot refrain taking notice here What reflections J. now had upon the

vast, variety of my particular circumstancm; how luau-(l T thought it that I,
449 I 3 M
who had spent forty years in a life of continual difficulties, and was at last
come, as it were, to the port or haven which all men drive at, viz. to have
rest and plenty, should be a. volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy
choice; and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should
now come to be hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime
which I was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of, After those
thoughts, something of religion would come in; and 1' would be. considering
that this seemed to me to be a. disposition of immediate Providence, and I
ought to look upon it and submit to it as such. For, although I was inno-
cent as to men, I was far from being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought
to look in and examine what other crimes in my life were most obvious to
me, and for which Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a
retribution; and thus I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a ship--
wreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.

In its turn, natural eourge would sometimes take its place, and then I
would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that 1 would not be
taken to_ be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in cold
blood; that it were much better to have fallen into the hands of the savages,
though I was sure they would feast upon me when they had loken me, than
those who Would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and
barbarities ; that in the case of the savages, I always resolved to die fighting
to the last gasp, and why should I not do so now? Whenever these thoughts
prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the agitation
of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was
engaged, and I always resolved to take no quarter at their hands; but, even,
at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship and all that
was in her, and leave them but little booty to boast of. _

The greater Weight the anxieties and perplexities of these things were
to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our satisfaction when
we saw ourselves on shore; and my partner told me he dreamed that he
had a very heavy load upon his back, which he. was to carry up a hill, and
found that he. was not able to stand longer under it; but; that the Portuguese
pilot came and took it ofi' his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground
before him appearing all smooth and plain: and truly it was so ; they were
all like men who had a load taken off their backs For my part, I had a
Weight taken oil" from my heart that it was not able any longer to hear;
and as T said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. "Then

we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us 0. lodging,
' 450I'A'ruxu sums Hanan) cause: '10 ac 10 Film.

together with a. warehouse for our goods; it was a little hut, with a larger
house adjoining to iii, built. and also palisadocd round with canes, to keep
out pili'erers, of which there were not a few in that country: however, the
magistrates allowed us a little guard, and we had a soldier with a. kind of
half-pike, who stood sentinel at our door; to whom we allowed a. pinl- of
rice, and a. piece. of money, about the value of three-pence, per day, so that
our gmds were kept very safe.

The fair, or max-b, usually kept at this place, luid been over some time:
however, we found that there were three or four junks in the river, and two
ships from Japan, wit-h goods which thuy had bought in China5 and were
not gone away, having some Japanese merchants on Show.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to get us

acquainted with three missionary Romisli priests who were in the town
m
and who had been there some time converting the people to Christianity;
but we thought they made but poor work of it, and made them but sorry
Christians when they had done. One of these was a Frenchman, whom
they called Fat-her Simon; another was u. Portuguese; and the third 9.
Genoesc. Father Simon was courteous, and very agreeable company; but
the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied
seriously to the work they came about, viz. to' talk with, and insinuate them'
selves among the inhabitants, wherever they had opportunity. "'0 often
ate and drunk with those men; and though, I must confess, the conversion,
as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the true con-
version required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, that it seems
to amount to little more than letting them know the name of Christ, and
say some pmyers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they
understood not, and to cross themselves, and the like; yet it must be con-
fessed that the religionisls, whom we call missionaries. have a firm belief
that these people will be saved, and that they are the. instruments of it;
and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage, and
the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, and the
most violent tortures, for the sake of this work.

Father Simon was appointed, itseems, by order of the chief of the
mission, to go up to I'ekiu, and waited only for another priest, who was
ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with him. We sein'ee ever
met together but he was inviting me to go that journey; telling me how he
would show me all the glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among
the rest, Pekin, the greatest eity in the world ; " a. city," said he, " that your
London and our Paris put together cannot he equal to." But as I looked
on those things with difierent eyes from other men, so l shall give my
opinion of them in a few words, when I come in the course of my travels
to speak more particularly of them.

Dining with Father Simon one day, and being very merry together, I
showed some little inclination to go with him 3 and he pressed me and my
partner very hard to consent. "Why. father," says my partner, " should
you desire our company so much? you know We are heretics, and you do
not love us, nor cannot keep us company with any pleasure."--" 0h," says
he, " you may perhaps he good Catholics in time; my business here is to
convert heathens, and who knows but I may convert you tool"--" Very
well, father," said I, " so you will preach to us all the way? "---" I will not
be troublesome to you," says he ; " our religion does not divest us of good

'62
manners ; besides, we are here like countrymen ; and so we are, compared in
the place we are in ; and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may all
he Ch1istians at last , at least, we we all gentlemen, and we may eonveise
so, without being uneasy to one another." 1 liked this put of his discourse
very well, and it began to put me in mind of my priest that I had left 111
the B111.zils;but Fothm Simon did not come up to his character by 11 grout
deal; for though this friar had no appearance of a criminal levity in him,
yet he had not that. fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere alTeetion
to religion, that my other good eeelesiastie had.

But to leave him a little, though he never loll>> us, nor soliciting us to go
with him 3 we had something else before us at first, for we had all this while
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubt-
ful what we should do, for we were now in a. place of very little business.
Once I was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and the city of
Nankin; but Providence seemed now more visibly, as T thought, than ever
to concern itself in our affairs; and I was encouraged, from this very time,
to think I should, one way or othei, get out of this entangled circumstance
and be brought home to my own country again, though I had not the least
view of the manner. PIOV ideneo, I so), began hereto eleai 11p our way a little;
and the first thing that oll'e1ed w as, that our old Portuguese pilot brought
:1 Japan merchant to us, who inquired what goods we had; and, in the first
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying
115 in gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in
small wedges, of about ten or twelve ounces each. While we were dealing
with him for our opium, it came into my head that he might. perhaps deal
for the ship loo, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it; to him. He
shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him ; but in a
few days after he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make to me, which was this:
he had bought a great quantity of our goods, when he had no thoughts of
proposals made to him of buying the ship; and that, therefore, he had not
money to pay for the ship: but if I would let the some men who were in
the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan; and would
send them from thence to the Philippine Tslands with another leading,
which he would pay the {might of before they went from Japan: and that
at their return he would buy the ship. 1 began to listen to his proposal,
and so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not but.
being to entertain a notion of going myself with him, and so to set soil from

453
the Philippine Islands away to the South Sous; accordingly, I asked the
Japanese merchant if he would not hire us to the Philippine Islands and
discharge us there He. said no, he could not do that, for then he could not
have the return of his cargo; but heuouhl discharge us in Japan, at the
ship's return. "Yell, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and going
myself ; but my partner, wiser than mySelf, persuaded me from it, repre-
senting the dangers, as well of the sees as of the Japanese, who are in false,
cruel, and treacherous people ; likewise those of the Spaniards at the
Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous than they.

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion ; the first thing
we had to do was, to consult with the captain of the ship, and with his
men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan. While I was doing
this, the young man whom my nephew had left with me as my companion
came up, and told me that he thought that voyage promised very fair, and
that there was a great prospect of advantage, and he would he very glad if
I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would
go as a merchant, or us I pleased to order him; that if ever he come to
England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a. faithful account-
of his success, which should be as much mine as T pleased. I was 10th to
part with him ; but considering the prospect. of advantage, which really was
considerable, and that he was a young fellow likely to do well in it, I
inclined to let him go ; but I told him I would consult my partner, and give
him an answer the next day. I discoursed about it with my partner, who
thereupon made :1. most generous offer : " You know it has been on unlucky
ship," said he, " and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again ; if your
steward (so he called my man) will venture the voyage, I will leave my
share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best of it ; and if we live
to meet in England, end-he meets with success abroad, he shall account for
one half of the profits of the ship's freight to us ; the other shall be his own."

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my yoruig man, made
him such an ofi'er, I could not do less then ofl'cr him the some; and all the
ship's company being willing to go with him, we made over half the ship to
him in property, and took a writing from him, ohliging him to account for
the other, and away he went to J open. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual, honest man to him ; protected him at J open, and got him a licence
to come on shore, which the Europeans in general have not lately obtained.
He paid him his freight very punctually ; sent him to the Philippines,

loaded with Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who,
454
trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, and a
great quantity of spices ; and there he was not only paid his freight very
well, and at a very good price, but not being willing to sell the ship then,
the merchant furnished him goods on his own secount ; and with some
money, and some spices of his own which he brought with him, he went
back to the Manillos, where he sold his cargo very well Here, having made
a. good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship mode a free ship, and the
governor of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, on the coast of America,
and gave him a licence. to land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in
any Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made the voyage to
Acapulco very happily, and there he sold his ship; and having there also
obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bella, he found means to get
to Jamaica, with all his treasure ; and about eight years after came to
England, exceeding rich.

But, to return to our particular afi'aiis: being now to part with the ship
and ship's company, it came before us, of course, to consider what recom-
pense we should give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the
design against us in the river Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us
a very considerable service, and deserved well at our hands; though, by the
way, they were a couple of rogues too; for, as they believed the story of our
being pirates, and that we had really run away with the ship, they came down
to us, not only to betray the design that was formed against us, but to go to
sea with us as pirates. One of them confessed afterwards that nothing else
but the hopes of going a roguing brought him to do it: however, the service
they did us was not the less, and, therefore, as I had promised to be grateful
to them, I first ordered the money to be paid them which they said was due
to them on board their respective ships : over and above that, I gave each
of them a small sum of money in gold, which contented them very well. I
then made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made
second mate and parser; the Dutchman I made hoatswain; so they were
both very well pleased, and proved very serviceable, being both able seamen,
and very stout fellows.

We were now on shore in China; if I thought myself banished, and
remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had many ways to get
home for my money, what could I think of myself now, when I was
about a thousand leagues further off from home, and destitute of all manner
of prospect of return? All we had for it was this, that in about four

months' time there was to be another fair at the place where we were,
456
and then we might be able to purchase various manufactures of the
Vcountry, and withal might. possibly (ind some Chinese junks from 'l'onquin
for sale, that; would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This
I liked very well, and resolved to wait ', besides, as our particular persons
were not obnoxious, so, if any English or Dutch ships came thither,
perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage
to some other place in India nearer home. Upon these hopes, we resolved
to cominue here; but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys
into the country. .

First, we Went ten days' journey to Xunlriu, a city well worth seeing;
they say it has a million of people in it: it. is regularly built, and the
streets are all straight, and cross one another in direct lines. But when
I come to compare the miserable people of these countries with ours,
their fabrics, their manner of living, their government, their religion, their
wealth, and their glory, as some cull it, I must confess that I scarcely think
it worth my while to mention them here. We wonder ALL the grandeur, the
riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manufactures, the
commerce, and conduct of these people ; not. that there is really any matter
for wonder, but because, having a. true notion of the berharity of those
countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that. prevail there, we do not
expect. to find any such thing so for off. Otherwise, what are their
buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade
to the universal commerce of England, Holland, France, and Spain? What;
are their cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture,
and infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a few junks and
barks, to our navigation, our merchants fleets, our large and powerful navies'i
Our city of London has more trade than half their mighty empire: one
English, Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty guns, would be able to
fight almost all the shipping belonging to China: but the greatness of
their wealth, their trade, the power of their government, and the strength
of their armies, may be. a little surprising to us, because, as I have said,
considering them as a. barbarous nation of Pagans, little better than savages,
we did not expect such things among them. But- nll the forccs of their
empire, though they were to bring two millions of men inLo the field
together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the country, and starve
themselves; 11- million of their foot could not stand before one embattled
body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surroum'led, though they were

could defeat all the forces of China Nor is there a fortified town in China.
that could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an
European army. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward
and uncertain in their going off ; and their powder has but little strength.
Their armies are badly disciplined, and want skill to attack, or temper to
retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I
came home, and heard our people say such fine things of the power, glory,
magnificence, and trade of the Chinese; because, as far as 1 saw, they
oppcured to be u contemprible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves,
subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a people; nnd were
not its distance inconceivahly great from Mnscovy, and that empire in a.
manner as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar of Muscovy
might with ease drive them all out of their country, and conquer them in
one campaign ; and had the Czar (who is now a growing prince) fallen this
way, instead of attxwlring the warlike Swed l", and equally improved him-
self in the art of war, as they say he has done ; and if none. of the powers
of Europe had envied or interrupted him, he might by this time huvc heen
Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at
Nerve, when the latter was not one to six in number.

As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and
husbandry, are very impel-feet, compared to the some. things in Europe ;
also, in their knowledge, their learning, and in their skill in Lhe sciences,
they are either very awkward or defective, though they have globes or
spheres, and a smattering of the mathematics, and think they know more
than all the world besides. But; the)r know little of the motions of the
heavenly bodies; and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common
people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has
assaulted it, and is going to run nwoy with it; and they full :1 elattcring
with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright the monster away,
just as we do to hive a swarm of hoes 2

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in all the
accounts I hove given of my travels, so l slmll make no more such t is
none of my business, nor'smy part of my design; but io give an account
of my own adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings, and a long
variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that. come after me will have heard
the like of: I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty places,

desert countries, and numerous people, 1 have yet to pass through, more
'57 3 N
than relates to my own story, and which my concern among them make
necessary. '

I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China, about
thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned from Nunkin, I
had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I hurl heard so much
of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length, his time
of going away being set, and the other missionary who was to go with
him being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that We should resolve
either to go, or not; so I referred it to my partner, and left it wholly
to his choice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative, find we prepared
for our journey. We set out with very good advantage, as to finding the
way 3 for We got leave to travel in the rebinue of one of their mandarins,
a kind of Viceroy or principal magistrate in the province where they reside,
and who take great state upon them, travelling with great attendance,
and great homage from the people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished
by them, being obliged to fiu'nish provisions for them and all their atten-
dants in their journeys. I particularly observed in our travelling with his
buggge, that though we received sufficient provisions both for ourselves
and our horses from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet We
were obliged to pay for everything we had, after the market price of the
country, and the maudarin's steward collected it duly from us. Thus our
travelling in the retinue of the mandarin, though it was a great not of
kindness, was not such a. mighty favour to us, but was a great. advantage
to him, considering there were above thirty other people travelled in the
same manner besides us, under the protection of his rebinue; for the
country furnished all the provisions for nothing to 'him, and yet he took
our money for them.

We were twenty--five (lays travelling to l'ekin, through a country
exceeding populous, but I think badly cultivated; the husbandry, the
economy, and the way of living miserable, though they boast so much of
the industry of the people: I say miserable, if compared with our own,
but not so to these poor wretches, who know no other. The pride of the
Poor people is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
in some parts, which adds to that which I call their misery; and I must
needs think the savages of America live much more happy than the
poorer sort of these, because as they lnwe nothing, so they desire nothing;
whereas those are proud and insolcnt, and in the main are in many parts

more beggars and drudgcs. Their ostentation is inexpressiblc ; and, if they
458
can, they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last
degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all the World but themselves.

I must confess T travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the deserts and
vast wildernesscs of Grand Tartar . than here, and yet the roads here are
well paved and well kept, and very convenient for travellcm; but nothing
was more awkward to me than to see such it haughty, imperious, insoleut
people, in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; and my
friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these occasions, to
see their began}? pride. For example, (mining by the house of a. country
gentleman, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues off the city of
Nankin, we had first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house

about two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being
a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper for a merry-
antlrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tasscls, and cuts and
slashes almost on every side: it covered a tafl'ety rest, so greasy as to
testify that his honour must be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was a
poor, starved, hobbling creature, and two slaves followed him on foot to
drive the poor creature along ; he had a whip in his hand, and he bolubourcd
the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about. the tail ; and thus
he rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the city to his
country soot, about half 1!, league before us. We travelled on gently, but

this figure of u. gentleman rode away before us; and as we stopped at a
469
o

village about an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country seat of
this great men, we saw him in a little place before his door, eating a repast.
It was a kind of garden, but he was easy to be seen; and we were given
to understand that. the more we looked at him the better he would he

shaded him over the head, and on the south side; but under the tree was
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look well enough. He sat
lolling hack in it great elbow-chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and had
his meat brought him by two women slaves. He had two more, one of whom
fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand,
and scraped off what she let fell upon. his worship's beard and taffety vest

Leaving the poor wrclch to please himself with our looking at him. as
if we admired his idle pomp, we pursued our journey. Father Simon had
the curiosity to stay to inform himself what daintics the country justice
had to feed on in all his state, which he had the honour to taste of, and
which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in it,
and a. little hag filled with green pepper, and another plant which they have
there, something like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting like
mustard ; all this was put together, and a small piece of lean mutton boiled
in it, and this Washis worship's repast. Four or five servants more
attended at a distance, who we supposed were to eat of the same after their
master. As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected as
a king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended in all his
appearances with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance. I
observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers
packhoises in England seemed to me to look much better; though it was
hard to judgc rightly, for they were so covered with equipuge, mantles,
trappings, the. that we could scarce see anything but their feet and their
heads as the)r went along.

I was now light-hearted, and all my late trouble and perplexity being
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which made this journey the
pleasanter to me ; in which no ill accident- attended me, only in passing or
fro-ding a small river, my horse fell, and made me free of the country, as
they call it,-----thut is to say, threw me in. The place wns not deep, but it
wetted me all over. I mention it because it spoiled my pocket-hook,
wherein I had set down the. names of several people and places which I
had occasion to remember, and which not taking due care of, the leaves

rotted, and the words were never after to be read.

At length we arrived at. l'ekini I had nobody with me but the youth
whom my nephew had given me to attend me as a servant, and who
proved very trusty and diligent ; and my partner had nobody with him but
one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot,' he being
desirous to see the court, we bore his charges for his company, and for our
use of him as an interpreter, for he understood the language of the country,
and spoke good French and a. little English. Indeed, this old man was

 

rm; cums): ons'rmuu)! nus! xx sum,

most useful to us everywhere; for we hurl not. been above a Week at. Pekin,
when he came laughing. " Ah, Seignior Inglese," says he, " l have. some--
thing to tell will make your heart gluLl."----" My heart glad," says I ; "what
can that be? I don't know anything in this country can either give me
joy 01' grief to any great degree." "Yes, yes," said the oltl men in broken
English, "make you glad, me sorry."--"Why," said I, "mil ll- make you
sorry?"----"Benause," said he, " you have bmught me here twenty-lire days'
461
journey, and will leave me to go back ( lune : and which way shall I get to
my port afterwards, without a ship, without a horse, without pecune?"---
so he called money, being his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to
make us merry with. In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their
journey by land to Museovy, within four or five weeks ; and he was sure
we would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind, to
go back alone.

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and had. scarce
power to speak to him for some time, but at last>> I said to him. " How do
you know this? are you sure it is true?"--"Yes," says he ; "I met this
morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is
among them. We cznue last horn Astraciui, and was designing to go to
Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now
resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wolgn to
:\strugan."--" Well, Scigninr," says I, " do not be uneasy about being left
to go back alone -, if this be. a method for my return to England, it shall be
your fault if you go heel: to Macao at all." We then went to consult
together what was to be done ; and I asked my partner what he thought of
the pilot's news, and whether it'wonld suit with his affairs? He told me
he would do just as I would; for he had settled all his nllhirs so well at
Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had made a good
voyage, if he could invest it in China. silks, wrought and raw, he would be
content to go to England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal by the
Company's ships

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot
would go with us, we would hear his charges to Moscow, or to England, if
he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over generous in that
either, if we haul nut mwan'ked him further, the service he had done us
being mall}r worth more than that; for he. had not only been 9. pi lot to us
at son, but he had been like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring
for us the Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.
So, being willing to gratify him, which was but doing him justice, and very
willing also to have him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man
on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as
l computed it, was worth one hundred and seventy-live pounds sterling,
between us, and to bear all his chaiges, both for himself and horse, except

only a horse to carry his goods Having settled this between ourselves, m:
462
called him to let him know what we had resolved. I told him he had.
complained of our being willing to let him go back alone, and I was now
about. to tell him we designed he should not go back at all. That as we
had resolved to go to Eur-0pc with the caravan, we were very willing he
should go with us; and that we called him to know his mind. He shook.
his head and said it was a long journey, and that he had no pecans to carry
him thither, or to subsist himself when he come there. We told him we
believed it. was so, and therefore we had resolved to do something for him
' that should let him see how sensible we were of the service he had done
us, and also how agreeable he was to us : and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out 'as we would do our
own ; and that as for his charges, if he would go with us we would set him
safe on shore (life and casualties excepted), either in Muscovy or England, _
as he would choose, at our own charge, except only Lhe carriage of his
goods. He received the proposal like it man transported, and told us he
would go with us over the Whole world; and so we all prepared for our
journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants:
they had many things to do, and instead of being ready in five weeks, it
was four months and some days before all things were got together.

It was the beginning of February, New Style, when we set- out from
Pokin. My partner and the old pilot had gone express book to the port
where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we had loll:
there; and I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of at
Nnnkin, and who porno to Pokin on his own affairs, went to Nankin, where
I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of
other very fine silks of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all
these brought to Pckin against my partner's return. Besides this, we bought
a large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in
these goods only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling ;
which, together with tea and some fine calicoes, and three camols' loads of
nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides
those we rode upon ; these, with two or three spare horses, and two horses
loaded with provisions, made together twenty-six camels and horses in
our retinue.

The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, made
between three and, four hundred horse, and upwards of one hundred and
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all events; for as the

eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by
463
the Tortnrs. The company consisted of people of several nations; but
there were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though
of them some were Livoninns; and to our particular satisfaction, five of
them were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience in
husineSS, and of very good substance.

\Vhen we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were five in
number, called all the passengers, except the servants, to 21 great council as
they called it. At this council, every one deposited a certain quantity of
money too common stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on
the way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the
guides, getting horses, and the like. Here, too, they constituted the
journey, as they call it; viz. they named captains and officers to draw us
all up, and give the word of command, in case of an attack, and give every
one their turn of command; nor was this forming us into order any more
than what we. afterwards found needful on the way.

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and is full of
pot-tors and earth-makers--that is to say, people that temper the earth for
the China were As I was coming along, our Portuguese pilot, who had
always something or other to say to make us merry, told me he would
show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should have this
to say of China, after all the ill--humoured things that i had said of it, that
1 had seen one thing which was not to be seen in oil the world beside. I
was very importuuate to know what it was; at last he told me it was a
gentleman's house built with China ware " Well " says I_ "are not the
matc1iuls of their buildings the product of their own country, and so it is
all China "6.10, is it not?"-- " No, no," says he, "1 menu it is a house. all
made of China were, such as you call it in England, or as it is called in
our country, porcelain."--"Well," says I, " such a thing may be; how big
is it? Can we carry it in a box upon a. camel? If we can, we will. buy it."
--" Upon a camel Z " says the old pilot, holding up both his hands; " why,
there is u family of thirty people lives in it."

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I come to it, it was
nothing but. this: it was a timber house, or a house huilt, as we call it in
England, with lat-l1 and plaster, but ull this plastering was really" China
warm--that. is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China
were. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked
very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as the large China

were in England is painted, and hard as if it had been burned. As to the
461
inside, all the walls, instead of Wainscot, were lined with hardened and
painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley-tiles in England, all
made of the finest China, and the figures exceeding {the indeed. with
extrzwrdinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but
one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the some
earth, that>> it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the
rooms were of the same composition, and us hard as the earthen floors we
have in use in several parts of England ; as hard as stone, and smooth, but
not burned and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, which were
all, as it were, paved with the same tile; the ceiling and all the plastering
work in the whole house were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof
was covered with tiles of the some, but of 9. deep shining black. This was .
a China. warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be called so, and had I
not been upon the journey, I could have stayed some days to see and
examine the particulars of it. They told me there were fountains and fish-
ponds in the garden, all paved on the bottom and sides with the same;
and fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the
porcelain earth, burned whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be allowed to
excel in it; but I mu very sure they excel in their accounts of it; for they
told me such incredible things of their performance in crockery-ware, for ,
such it is, that I care not. to relate, as knowing it could not. be true. They
told me, in particular, of one workman that made it ship with all its
tackle and masts and sails in earthenware, big enough to carry fifty men.
If they had told me he launched it, and made. a vuyzuo to Japan in it, I
might have said something to it indeed; but as it was, I lmcw the whole
of the story, which was, in short, that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and
said nothing to it This odd sight kept me two hours lmhind the caravan,
for which the leader of it. for the day fined me about the value of three
shillings; and told me if it had been three days' journey without the wall,
as it. was three days within, he must have fined me four times as much,
and made me ask pardon the next council day. I promised to he more
orderly; and, indeed, I found after-minds the orders made for keeping all
together were absolutely necessanr for our common safety.

In two days more we. passed the great China Wall, made for a fortifica-
tion against the Tamils: and a very great work it is, going over hills and
mountains in an endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the

pi'ecipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or
465 3 0
where, if they did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is
near a thousand English miles, but that the country is five hundred in n
straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without measuring the
windings and turnings it takes; it is about four fathoms high, and as many
thick in some places.

I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing on our orders
(for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look at it on every side,
near and for of? ; I mean what was within my view: and the guide, who had
been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to hear
my opinion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep out
the Torture; which he happened not to understand as I meant it, end so
took it for a compliment; but the old pilot laughed: " Oh, Seignior
Inglesc," says he, " you spend: in oolours."--" In colours!" said I, "what
do you mean by thut?"----" Why, you speak what looks white this way,
and black that way,--gny one way and dull another. You tell him it is
a good well to keep out Tartan; you tell me by that it is good for
nothing but to keep out Tartars. I understand you, Scignior Inglese, I
understand you; but Seignior Chinese understood you his own way."
"Well," says I, " do you think it would stand out an army of our country
people, with a good train of artillery 3 or our engineers, with two companies
of miners? Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army
might enter in battaliu ; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that
there should be no Sign of it 1efi?"--"Ay, ay," says he, "I know that"
The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said to the pilot, and I gave
him leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then almost out of their
country, and he was to leave us a little time after this; but when he knew
what I said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more
of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatness while he stayed.

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like the
Picts' wall, so famous in Northumberland, built by the Romans, we began
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people rather confined to live
in fortified towns, as being subject to the inroads and depredations of the
Tar-tars, who rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by
the naked inhabitants of an open country. And hero I began to find the
neeessity of keeping together in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw
several troups of Terms roving about; but when 1 came to see them
distinctly, I wondered more that. the Chinese empire could be conquered

by such contemptible fellows ; for they are a mere horde of wild fellows,
465
keeping no order, and understanding no discipline or manner of fight.
Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing:
and this we found the first day we saw them, which was alter we entered
the wilder part of the country. Our lender for the day gave leave for
about. sixteen of its to go a hunting as they call it; and what wus this but
a hunting of sheep !----howovcr, it may be called hunting, too, for these
creatures are the. wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind :
only they will not run a. great way, and ,you are sure of sport when you
begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or forty in a flock, and,
like true sheep, always keep together when they fly.

 

Tu mm mm A man>> an inn mun-rims.

In pursuit of this odd sort of grime, it was our hap to meet with about.
forty Tartan: whether they were hunting mutton, as we Were, or whether
they looked' for another kind of prey, we know not; but as soon as they
suw us, one of them blew a hideous blast on a kind of horn. This was to
call their friends about them, and, in less than ten minutes, a troop of
forty or fifty more appeared, ut- about a mile distance; but our work was
over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst us;
and us soon as he heard the horn, he told us that we had nothing to do but
to charge them without loss of time; and, drawing us up in a. line, he

asked if we were resolved. We told him we wow ready to follow him ; so
467
he rode directly towards them. They stood gazing at us like a mere
crowd, drawn up in no sort of order at all; but 115 soon as they saw us
advance, they let fly their arrows, which missed us, very happily. Not
that they mistook their aim, but their distance; for their arrows all fell a.
little short of us, but with so true on aim, that had we boon about twenty
yards nearer, we must have had several men wounded, if not killed

Immediately we halted, and though it was at 1:. great- distance, we fired,
and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, following our shot l'ull-
gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand----for so our hold Scot that led
us directed. He was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with such
vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such cool courage too,
that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As soon us we
came up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew; but
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable. The only stand any of
them made'wns on our right, where three of them stood, and, by signs,
called the rest to come back to them, having a kind of Scimitar in their
hands, and their bows hanging to their backs. Onr brave commander,
without asking anybody to follow him, gallons up close to them, and with
his l'usee knocks one of them ofi' his horse, killed the second with his
pistol, and the third ran away. Thus ended our fight ; but. we had this
misfortune attending it, that all our mutton we had in chase got. away.
"To haul not a man killed or hurt ; as for the Tartars, there were about five
of them killed--how many were wounded we knew not; but this we
knew, that the other part-y were so frightened with the noise of our guns,
that they fled, and never made any attempt upon us.

We were 9.11 this while in the Chinese dmninions, and therefore the
Tartar-s were not so bold as afterwards ; but in about five days we entered
a vast wild desert, which held as three days and nights' march: and we
were. (.ililigczd to carry our water with us in great leathern bottles, and to
enenmp all night, just as I have heard they do in the desert of Arabia. I
asked our guides whose dominion this was in : and they told me this was a
kind of border, that might be called no man's land, being a part of Great
Kzirulcnthy, or Grand Tartar-y : that, however, it was all reckoned as belong-
ing to China, but that there was no care taken here to preserve it from the
inroads of thieves, and Lhcrel'ore it was reckoned the worst desert in the
whole march, though we were to go over some much larger.

in passing this frightful wilderness, we saw, two or three times, little
parties of the Tartar-s, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to

468
have no design upon us; and so, like. the man who met the devil, if they
111141 not-hing to my to us, we had nothing to say to them : we let them go.
Once, however, a. party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us.
"'hether it was to consider if they should attack us or not, we knew not ;
but when we had passed at some distance by them, we made a rear-guard of
forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half a mile or
thoroabonts before us. After a while they marched oil", but. they saluted
us with five arrows at their parting, which wounded a horse so that it dis--
abled him, and we left him the next day, poor creature, in great need of a.
good farricr. we saw no more arrows or Tutors that time.

We travelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good as at
first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of China, but lay for the
most part in the villages, some of which were fortified, because of the in-
cursions of the Tartars. When we were come to one of these towns (about
two days and a. halts journey before we came to the city of Naum), I wanted
to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that
road, and horses also; such as they are, because, so many caravans coming
that way, they are often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me- a
camel, would have gone and fetched one for me; but 1, like a fool, must. he
olllcious, and go myself along with him: the placc was about two miles out
of the village, where, it seems, they kept the camels and horses feeding
under a. guard.

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very desirous
of a little variety. When we came to the place, it was a low, marshy
ground, walled round with stones, piled up dry, without mortar or earth
among them, like a, park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door.
Having bought a camel, and xmreed for the price, I came away, and the
Chinese that went with me led the camel, when on a sudden came up five
Tartars on horseback. Two of them seized the fellow and took the camel
from him, while the other three stepped up to me. and my old pilot, seeing
us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which
could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came up
stopped short upon my drawing my sword, for they arc urrunt cowards; but
a. second, coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never
felt till afterwards, and wondered, when .[ came to myself, what was the
matter, and where l was, for he laid me flat on the ground; but my never-
failing old pilot, the Portuguese, had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew

notm of, nor the Tartars either; if they had, I suppose they would not
469
have attached us, for cowards are always boldest when there is no danger.
The old man seeing me down, with a hold heart stepped up to the fellow
that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling
him down by main force a little towards him, with the other shot him in
the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. He then immediately stepped
up to him who hurl stopped us, as I said, and before he could come forward
again, made a blow at him with a seimitar, which he always wore, but
missing the man, struck his horse in the side of his head, out one of the ears
ofl' by the root, end a great slice down by the side of his face. The poor
beast, enmged with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow sat well enough too, but away he flew, and carried him
quite out of the pilot's reach; and at some distance, rising upon his hind
legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him.

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, but
he had no weapon: however, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen
upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly weapon he had
by his side, something like a poleuxe, he wrenched it from him, and made
shift to knock his Tortorian brains out with it. But my old man had the
third Tartar to deal with still; and seeing he did not lly, as he expected,
not come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stood stock still, the old
man stood still. too, and fell to work with his tackle to charge his pistol
again; but, as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, away he seemed, and left
my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a complete victory.

By this time I was a, little recovered. I thought, when I first begun to
wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep; but, us I said above, I wondered
where l was, how I came upon the ground, and what was the matter. A
few moments after, as sense returned, I fell.- pain, though 1 did not know
where ; so I chipped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody, then I
felt. my head ache : and in a moment memory returned, and everything was
present to me again. I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my
sword, but no enemies were in View: I found a Tartar lying deed, and his
horse standing very quietly by him; and, looking further, I saw my (le-
liverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back with
his hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running
to me, and joyfully embraced me, being afraid before that I hurl been killed.
Seeing me bloody, he would see how 1 was hurt ; but. it was not much, only
what we call a broken head ; neither did 1 afterwards lind any great incon<<
venienee from the blow, for it was well again in two 0'. three days.

470
We made no great gain, hmvever, by this victory, for we lost a. camel
and gained a horse. I paid for the lost camel, and sent for another ; but 1 -
did not go to fetch it myself: I had llild enough ol'that.

The city of Nauru, which we were approaching, is a frontier of the
Chinese empire, and is fortified in their fashion. We wanted, as I have
said, above two days' journey of this city, when messengers were sent
express to every pan of the road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt
till they had a guard sent for them 3 for that an unusual body of Tar-burs,

 

close: In woenmm )K A scvnm wn'u ran fLRfAM

making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles
beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travellers: however, it- wus carefully done
of the governor, and We were very glad to hear we should have a guard.
Accordingly, W0 days alter, we had two hundred soldiers sent us fronr a
garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three hundmd more from the oily
of Naum, and with these we advanced boldly. The three hundred soldiers

from Nuum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men

011 each side of our enmels w ith our bnugnge and 1.1111. whole caravan in the
centre , in this (11111213111111 11211111111111.1'ed for 111111.111. we 111101111111.ourselves a.
match for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tutors, il' the1- had uppezued;
but the next day. when they did :1ppear,1 it was quite another thing

Bin-11' in. the morning, 11 hen mmehino from 21 little town called Chungu,
We had 11. 1'11- er to 1111,53, 11. hich we were obliged to ferry ', 11.1111, had the Tar 111.1%

carm- 11.11 being over, the roar-guard was behind; but thev did not appear there.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon a dCSmt 01' about
fifteen or sixteen miles over, 11e knew, by a cloud of dust they raised, that
the enemy was at hand, and piesently they came on upon the spur.

Our Chinese guards,' 111 the 110111511110 had talked so hiw the dav before,
began to stagger; and the soldiers frequentlv looked behind them, a certain
sign in a soldier that he is just reudv to run away. My old pilot was of
my mind' and being near me, called out," 5111311101 Inglese, those 131110113
must be e11co1n-,aged 111-they will ruin us all, for it" the Tartars come on
they will never stand it." -" T 11111 oi your mind, " said I' " but 1'.-11111; must he

on each wing, and encourage them. The-311 will light like breve fellows in
breve company; but without this, they 1111.1 ever-1' 1112111 turn his back."
lmmediemly I rode up to our leader, and told him, who was exactly 01 our
mind; accordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing, and 5311 to the
left, and the rest made a line of rescue; and so we marched, leaving the
last two hundred men to make a hotly by themselves, and to guard the
Camels; only that, if need were, they should send a. hundred men to assist
the last- fifty.

At. last, the. Tartars came on, and an innu111e1-11hle company they were;

crowns, or thereahouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us ; and
here we rested one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there were nine
hundred soldiers kept- here ; but. the reason of it was, that formerly the Mus-
eovite frontiers lay near it to them than they now. do, the Museuvilzes-having
uhundoned that part of the country, which lies from this city west for about
two hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for use; and more especially being
so very remote, and so difficult to send troops thither for its defence: far
we were yet above two thousand miles from Muscovy, prone-fly so called.
After this, we passed seveml greet rivers, and two dreadful deserts ; one of
which we were sixteen days passing over; and. on the 13th of April, we

came to the fwntiem of the Musnovile dominions. I think the first town or
fortress, whichever it may he called, that belonged to the Czar, was called
Arguna, being on the west side of the river Arguna.

I could not but feel great satisfiwhou that [was arrived in a country
governed by Christians; for though the hillseoxdtes do, in my opinion, but
just deserve the name of Christians, yet sueh they pretend to be, and are
very devout in their way. It would certainly occur to 'any reflecting man
who travels the world as I have done, what u. blessing it; is to be brought
into the world where the name of (7'an and a Redeemer is known, adored,
and worshipped; and not when} the people, given up to strong delusions,
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to monsters, elements. horrid-

473 3 p
shaped animals, and monstrous images. Not- a town or city we passed
through but had their pagodas, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant
people worshipping even the works of their own hands. Now we came
where, at least, a face of the Christian worshili appeared; Where the knee
was bowed 1.0 Jesus: and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian
religion was owned. and the name of the true God was called upon and
adored; and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the. brave Seats
merchant with my first- acknowledgment of this; and taking him by the
hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God, we are once again amongst Christians."
He smiled and answered, "Do not rejoice too soon. countryman; these
Museovitcs are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it,
you may see very little of the substance for some months further of our
journey."---"Well," says I, " but still it is better than Paganism, and
worshipping; of devils."--" Why, I will tell you," says he; "except the
Russian soldiers in the gurrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities
upon the road, all the rest or" this country, for above a thousand miles
further, is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of Pagans." And so
indeed, we found it

We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth that is to be
found in any part- of the world: we had, at. least, twelve thousand miles
to the sea, eastward ; two thousand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, west-_
ward; and above three thousand, if we left that sea, and went on west,
to the British and French channels: we had full five thousand miles to
the Indian or Persian Sea, south; and about eight hundred to the Frozen
Sea, north. _

We advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, and
were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar has taken to have cities and
towns built in as many places as it is possible to place them, where his
soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed by the
Romans in the remotest countries of their empire; some of which I had
read of were placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the
lodging of travellers. Thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at
these towns and stat-ions the garrisons and governors were Russians, and
professed Christians, yet the inhabitants Were mere pagans, sacrificing to
idols, and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven;
and not only so, but were, of all the heathcns and pagans that ever I met
with, the most barbarous, except only that they did not eat men's flesh.

Some instances of this we met with in the country between Arguna.
474
where we enter the Museovitc dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians
together, called Nortziousky, in which is a conLinued desert or forest, which
cost us twenty days to travel over. In a village near the last of these
plum-s, I had the curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most
brutish and uusuffemble. They had, T suppose, a great sacrifice that day;
for there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree, at diabolical kind of idol
made of wood; is was dressed up, too, in the most iiiLlly manner; its upper
garment was of sheepskins, with the wool outward ; u great Tartar bonnet
on the head, with two horns growing through in; it was about eight feet
high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion of parts.

 

(muses mum-i: rux 1m": moi.

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village ; and, when I
come near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures ull lying flat upon
the ground round this hideous block of wood; 1 saw no motion among
them, any more than if they had been all logs, like the idol, and at first I
really thought they had been so; but, when I came a little nearer, they
started up upon their feet, and raised a howl, as if it had been so many
deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if they were displeased at our
disturbing them. A little way off from the idol, and at the door of a hut,
made of sheep and cow skins dried, stood three men with long knives in
their hands ; and in the. middle of the lent appeared three sheep killed, and

one young bullock. These, it seems, were. sacrifices to that senseless log of
415
an idol; the three men were priests belonging to it, and the seventeen
pmstrated wretches were the people who brought the offering, and were
making their prayers to that stock.

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brut-ish worship of a
hohgoblin than ever I was at anything in my life, and, overcome with rage,
I rode up to the hideous idol, and with my sword made a stroke at the
bonnet that was on its head, and out it in two; and one of our men that
was with me, taking hold of the sheep--skin that covered it, pulled at it,
when, behold, a most hideous outcry ran through the village, and two or
three hundred people came about my cars, so that I was glad to scour for
it, for some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from that moment to
visit them again. Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was
about four miles 013', in order to provide some horses which they wanted,
several of the homes having been lamed and jaded with the long march over
the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put my design in execution.
I communicated it to the Scots merchant, of whose courage I had sufficient
testimony; I told him what I had seen, and with what indignation I had
since thought that human nature could be so degenerate; I told him if I
could get but four or five men Well armed to go with me, I was resolved to
go and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no
power to help itself, and consequently could not be an object of worship, or
to he prayed to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it.

He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that, owing to the
gross ignorance of the people, they could not he brought to profit by the.
lesson I meant to teach them ; and added that, from his knowledge of the
_ country and its customs, he feared we should fall into great- peril by
giving offence to these brutal idol worshippers. This somewhat stayed my
purpose, but I was still uneasy all that day to put my project in execution;
and that evening meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town,
I again called upon him to aid me in it. "'hen he found me resolutc he
said that, on further thoughts, he could not but applaud the design, and
told me 1 should not go alone, but he would go with me, but he would go
first and bring a stout follow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us;
" and one," said he, " as famous for his zeal us you can desire any one to be
against such devilish things as these" So we. agreed to go, only we three
and my man-servant, and resolved to put it in execution the following
night about midnight, with all possible sceresy.

We thought it better to delay it till the next night, because the caravan

476
being to set forward in the morning, we supposed the governor could not
pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his
power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for the enterprise
as bold in executing, brought me a Turtar's robe or gown of sheep-skins,
and n bonnet. with u. bow and arrows, and had- provided the some for
himself and his countrymen, that the people, if they saw us, should not
determine who we were All the first night we spent in mixing up some
combustible matter, with aqua. vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials
as we could get ; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an
hour after night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and round that the
' people had not the least suspicion of danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy; yet the moon gave us light enough to her) that the idol stood
just in the same posture and place that it did before. The people seemed
to be all at their rest; only that in the great hut, where we saw the three
priests, we saw alight, and going up close to the door, we heard people
talking as if there were five or six of them ; we concluded, therefore, that if
we set wildfire to the idol, these men would come out- inunediotely, and run
up to the place to rescue it from destruction ; and what to do with them we
knew not. Once we thought of currying it away, and setting fire to it. at a
distance ; but. when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our
carriage, so we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman was for setting
fire to the hut, and knocking the creatures that were there on the head
when they come out ; but 1 could not join with Hunt; I was against killing
them, if it were possible to avoid it. "Well, then," said the Scots merchant,
"1 will tell you what we will do: we will try to make them prisoners, tie
their hands, and make them stand and see their idol destroyed."

As it happened, we had twine or packtln'eztd enough about us, which we
used to tie our fireloeks together with; so we resolved to attack these
people first, and with as little noise as we could The first thing we did we
knocked at Lhe door, when one of the priests coming to it, we immediately
seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and
led him to the idol, where we goged him that he might not "raise a noise,
tied his feet also together, and left him on the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another would come
out to see what. the matter was ; but we waited so long till the third mun
came back to us; and then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently,
and immediately out came two more, and we served them just in the some.

:Il
manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the
idol some distance from one another; when, going back, we found two more
were come out of the door, and a. third stood behind them within the door.
\Ve seized the two, and immediately tied them, when the third, stepping

' back and crying out, my Soots merchant went in after them, and taking
out a composition we had made that would only smoke and stink, he set
fire to it, and threw it in among them. By that time the other Scotsman
and my man, taking charge of the two men already bound, and tied
together also by the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there, to
see if their idol would relieve them, making haste hack to us.

'When the firm: We had thrown in had filled the hut with so much
smoke that they were almost sufl'ocoled, we threw in at small leather bag of
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and mllowing it in, we found
there were but four people, who, as we supposed, haul been about some of
their diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short, frightened to death, at
least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak either, For
the smoke.

We quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke soon drove us out,
hound them as we had done the other, and all without any noise. Then we
carried them all together to the idol ; when we came them, We fell to Work
with him. First we danhed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and
tallow mixed with hrimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder, and wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his
bonnet; then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked about to see if we could find anything else to help to burn
him; when my Scotsman remembered that by the hut, where the men were,
there lay a heap of dry forage; away he and the other Scotsman ran and
[etched their arms full of that. When we had done this, we took all our
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and 1mgagged their
mouths, and made them stand up, and set them before their monstrous idol,
and then set fire to the whole.

We stayed by it a. quarter of an hour or thereehouts, till the powder
in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, and, as we could
perceive, had split altogether; and, in a word, till we saw it burned so
that it would soon be quite consumed. We then began to think of going
:urny ; but the scotsman said, " No, we must not go, for these poor deluded
wrenches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn themselves with

the idol." So we resolved to stay till the forage was burned down too, and
47s 'or noemsou censors

then come away and left them. After the feet was performed, we appeared
in the morning among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in getting
ready for our journey; nor could any man suppose that we had been any-
where but in our beds.

But the afi'uir did not end so; the next day came a great number of
the country people to the town gates, and in a. most outrageous manner
demanded satislsction of the Russian governor for thc insulting their priests
and burning their great Chan) Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertsinskay
were at first in a great consternation, for they said the Torture were already
no less thun thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out
messengers to appease them, assuring them that he know nothing of it,
and that there had not a soul in his garrison been shroud, so that it could
not he from anybody there : but if they could let him know who did it, they
should he exemplerily punished. They returned haughtily, that all the
country revorencod the grout Chem Chi-Tlnumgu, who dwelt in the sun, and
no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image but some Christian
miscreunt; and they therefore resolved to denounce war against him and
all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.

The governor, unwilling to make u breech, or to have any cause of war
alleged to be given by him, the Czar having strictly charged him to treat
the conquered country with gentleness, gore them all the good words he
could. At last he told them there as; 1'. caravan gone towards RuSsiu that
morning, and perhaps it was som: of them who had do:- them this injury;
and thut if they would be satisfied with that, he would send after them
to inquire into it. This seemed to ep'mnzc them little ; and accordingly
the governor sent alter us, and gave us a particular account how the thing
was ; intimating wit-ho], that if any in our caravan had done it they should
make their escape; but that whether we had done it or no, we should
make all the haste forward that . as possibl ; and that, in the mean time,
he would keep them in play as long as he oeuld.

This was very friendly in the governor: however, when it come to the
caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the matter; and as for us
that were guilty, ..e war: least of all suspected. However, the captain
of the caravan for the time took the hint that the governor guve us, and
we travelled two days and two nights, without any considerable stop, and
then we lay at a. village called Plothus: nor did we make any long
stop here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, another Muscovite colony,

and where we expected we should be safe. But upon the second day's
479
match from Plothus, by the clouds of dust bohind us at. a great distance,
it was plain We were pursued. We had entered a vast desert, and had
passed by a great lake called Schanks Oscr, when w'e perceived a large
body of horse appear on the other side of the lake, to the north, wc
travelling west. We observed they went away west, as we did, but had
supposed we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas We very
happily took the south side; and in two days more they disappeared again:
for they, believing we were still before them, pushed on till they come to
the Uddu, a very great river when it passes lhrthcr north, but when we
come to it we found it narrow and forduhle.

The third day they had either found their mistake, or had intelligence of
us, und came pouring in upon us towards dusk. We had, to our great satis-
faction, just pitched upon a convenient place for our camp; for, as we had
just entered upon a desert above five hundred miles over, where we had no
towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena, which
we had yet two days" march to; the desert, however, had some few woods
in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda;
it was in a. narrow strait, between little but very thick woods, that we
pitched our camp that night, expecting to he attacked before morning. As
it was usual for thc Mogul Tartars to go about in troops in that desert, so
the caravans always fortify themselves every night against them, as against,
armies of robbers; and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued But
we had this night a most advantageous camp ; for as we lay between two
woods, with a. little rivulot rimming just before our front, we could not be
surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front or rear. We took care
also to make our front as strong as we could, by placing our packs, with
the camels and horses, all in a line, on the inside of the river, and felling
some trees in our rear. I

In this posture we encampod for the night; but the enemy was upon
us before W0 had finished. They did not come on like thieves, as we
expected, but sent three messengers to us, to demand the men to be
delivered to them that had abused their priests, and burned their idol, that
they might burn them with fire; and upon this, they said, they would go
away, and do us no further harm, otherwise the)' would destroy us olL
Our men looked very blank at this message, and began to stare at one
another to soc who looked with the most guilt in their faces ; but nobody--
was the word--nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he

was well assured that; it was not done by any of our camp; that we were
450
peaceful merchants, travelling on our business; that we had done no harm
to them or to any one else; and that, therefom, they must look farther for
the enemies who had injured them, for we were not the people; so they
desired them not to disturb us, for if they did we should defend ourselves.

The}r were far from being satisfied with this for an answer; and a great

crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of day, to our
camp; but seeing us so well posted, they (lurst come no further than the
break in our front, where they stood, in such number as to terrify us very
much; indeed, some spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and looked
at us awhile, and then setting up a great howl, let fly a crowd of arrows
among us ; but we were well enough sheltered under our baggage, and 1 do
not remember that one of us was hurt.
' Some time after this, we saw them more a little to our right, and
expected them on the rear: when a cunning fellow, a. Cossack of Jurawena,
calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, " I will send all these
people away to Sibeilka." This was a city four or five days' journey at
leust to the right, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows,
and getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as it were
back to Nertshiskay; after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes
directly on the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell
them along story that the people who had burned the Chum Chi--Thaungu
were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them--
that is to say Christians: and that they had resolved to burn the god Scale
Tsar, belonging to the Tonguses. As this fellow was himself a Tartar, and
perfectly spoke their language, he counterl'eitcd so well that they all
believed him, and away they drove in a violent hurry to Sibeilku In less
than three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and we never heard
any more of them, nor whether they went to Sibeillm or no. So we passed
away safely on to J arawena, where there was a Russian garrison, and there
we rested five days.

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held no twenty--three
days' march. We furnished ourselves with some tents here, for the better
accommodating ourselves in the night; and the leader of the caravan pro--
cured sixteen waggons of the country, for carrying our water or provisions,
and these carriages were our defence, every night round our little camp ; so
that had the Tux-tars appeared, unless they had been very numerous indeed,
they would not have been able to hurt us. We may well be supposed to
have wanted rest gain after this long journey ; for in this desert we neither

481 3 Q
sew house nor tree, and source a bush; though we saw abundance of the
sable hunters, who are all Tartms of Mogul Tartary, of which this country
is a part; and they frequently attack small caravans, but we saw no num-
bers of them together.

Alter we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty well
inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by the Czar,
with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the camvwxs and defend the
country against the Turtors, who would otherwise make it very dangerous
travelling; and his ozaIish majesty has given such strict orders for the well
guarding the caravans, that, if there are an}r Tutors heard of in the country,
detachments of the garrison are always sent to see the travellers safe from
station to station. Thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an oppor-
tunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots merchant, who was
acquainted with him, offered us a. guard of fifty men, if we thought there
was any danger, to the next station

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe, we should
find the country better inhabited, and the people more civilised; butl
found myself mistaken in both; for we had yet the nation of the Tonguses
to pass through, where we saw the some tokens of paganism and burbarity as
before; only, us they were conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so
dangerous, but for rudeness of manners, and idolatry, no people in the world
ever went beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their
houses are built of the same; you know not a man from a woman, neither
by the ruggedness of their conntenancos nor their clothes; and in the
winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live underground in
vaults, which have cavities going from one to another. If the Tertuis had
their Chain Chi-Thaungu for a whole village or country, these had idols in
every hut and every cave. This country, I reckon, was, from the desert I
spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half of it being another desert,
which took us up twelve duys' severe travelling, without house or tree; and
we were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well water as bread
After we were out of this desert, and hurl travelled two days, we came to
Jane-lay, a Museovitc city, or station, on the great river Jenozav, which,
they told us there, parted Europe from Asia.

All the country bet-Ween the river Oby and the river Jcnezay is as
entirel}r pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Torture.
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom I had an

opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not much wiser, or
482
nearer Christianity, for being under the Museovite government, which they
acknowledged was true enough--hut that, as they said, was none of their
business; that if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguse, or
Tartar subjects, it should he done hy sending cleigymen among them, not
"soldiers ; and they added, with more sincerity than I expected, that it was
not. so much the concern of their monarch to make the people Christians as
to make them subjects,

 

anew: [5 Emma": AT nu: BFSRIAN Mom or Humid.

From this river to the Oby we crossed a. wild uncultivated country,
barren of people and good management, otherwise it is in itself a pleasant,
fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabitants we found in in are all
pgans. except such as are sent. among them from Russia; for this is the
country--I mean on both sides the river Olly--whither the Muscovite
criminals that are not put to death are banished, and from whence it is

next to impossible they should ever get away. I have nothing material to
483
say of my particular affairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of
Siberia, where I continued sonic time on the following account.

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter
began to come on space; whereupon my partner and I called a council
about our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as we were bound
for England, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of
sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter time, by which
means, indeed, the Russians travel more in winter than they can in summer,
as in these sledgcs they are able to run night and day: the snow, being
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the hills, voles, rivers,
and lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon the sur-
face, without any regard to what is underneath,

But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kind. I was
hound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways: either I
must go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jurisluw, and then go off
west for Narva, and the Gulf of Finland, and so on to Duntzic, where I
might possibly sell my China. cargo to good advantage ; or I must leave the
caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by
water to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of shipping either to
England, Holland, or Hamburgh.

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would have been pre-
posterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen up, and I
could not get passage; and to go by land in those countries was {or less
safe than among the Mogul Tartcrs: likewise, as to Archangel in October,
all the ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants who dwell
there in summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are
goo]: so that I could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter,
with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter.
Therefore, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way to let the
caravan go, and make provision to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in
Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three
things to wear out a. cold winter with, viz. plenty of provisions, such us the
country ulli'n'ded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent company.

1 was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island, where
I never l'elt cold, except when I had my agne; on the contrary, l had
much to do to hear any clothes on my back, and never made any fire but
without doors, which was necessary for dressing my food, do. Now I haul

three good vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to
484
the feet, and button close to the wrists; and all these lined with furs.
to make them sufficiently warm. As to a warm house, I must confess
I greatly dislike our way in England of making fires in every room in the
house in open chimneys, which, when the fire was out, always keeps the
air in the room cold as the climate. So I took an apartment in a good
house in the town, and ordered a chimney to be built like a furnace, in
the centre of six several rooms, like a store; the funnel to carry the
smoke went up one way, the door to come at the fire went in another,
and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no fire seen, just as they
heat baths in England. By this means we had always the same climate
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and yet we saw no
fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to meet
with good company here, in a cormtry so barbarous as this--one of the
most northernly parts of Europe But this being the country where the
state criminals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city
was full of Russian noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers, and courtiers. Here
was the famous Prince Galitzin, the old German Rohostiski, and several
other persons of note, and some ladies. By means of my Scotch mer-
chant whom, nevertheless, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance with
several of these gentlemen; and from these, in the long winter nights in
which I stayed here, I received several very agreeable visits.

It was talking one night with a certain Prince, one of the banished
ministers of state belonging to the Czar, that the discourse of my
particular case began. He had been telling me abundance of fine things
of the greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the absolute
power of the Emperor of the Russians: I interrupted him, and told him
I was a, greater and more powerful prince than ever the Czar was,
though my dominions were not so large, or my people so many. The
Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and, fixing his eyes steadily
upon me, began to wonder what I meant I said his wonder would cease
when I had explained myself, and told him the story at large of my living
in the island; and then how I managed both myself and the people that
were under me, just as I have since minutcd it down. They were
exceedingly taken with the story, and especially the prince, who told
me, with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be masters of
ourselves; that he would not have exchanged such a state of life as

mine, to be Czar of Muscovy ; and that he found more felicity in the
485
retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than over he found in
the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar;
that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to
our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under the weight of the
greatest storms without. When he come first hither, he said, he used
to tear the hair from his head, end the clothes from his back, as others
had done before him; but a. little time and consideration had made
him look into himself, as well as round him, to things without: that
he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon
the state of universal life, and how little this world was concerned in
its true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself, fully
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and desires, with
but very little assistance from the world, That being now deprived of
all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of worldly
plensm'es, he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them,
where he found all manner of deformity; and was now convinced that
virtue only makes a. man truly wise, rich, and great, and preserves him
in the way to ,a superior happiness in u future state; and in this, he
said, they were more happy in their banishment than all their enemies
were, who had the full posseSsion of all the wealth and power they had
left behind them. "Nor, sir," says he, " do 1 bring my mind to this
politically, from the necessity of my circumstances, which some call
miserable; but, if I know anything of myself, I would not now go back,
though the Czar my master should call me, and reinstate me in all my
former grandeur."

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much earnestness
and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it was the true sense of his
soul; there was no room to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once thought
myself a kind of monarch in my old station, of which I had given him
an account; but that I thought he was not only a monarch, but a great
conqueror; for he that had got a. victory over his own exorbitant desires,
and the absolute dominion over himself, he whose reason entirely governs
his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city.

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I thought it ;
the cold so intense that I could not so much as look abroad without being
wrapped in furs, and a kind of musk of fur before my face, with only
a hole for breath, and two for sight: the little daylight we had was for

three months not above five hours a (lay, and six at most; only that
lsr.
the snow lying on the ground continually, and the weather being clear,
it was never quite (lnrlc. Our horses were kept, or rather starved, under
ground; and as for our servants, whom we hired here to look after
ourselves and horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers and
toes to thaw and take care of, lest they should mortify and fell ofl'.

It is true, Within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the walls
thick, the windows small, and the glass all double. Our food was chiefly
the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season; bread good enough, but
baked as biscuits; dried fish of several sorts, and some flesh of mutton,
and of buffaloes, which is pretty good meat. All the stores of provisions
for the winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured: our drink
was water, mixed with aqua-vitae instead of brandy ; and for a treat, mead
instead or wine, which, however, they have very good. The hunters, who
venture abroad all weathers. frequently brought us in fine venison, and
sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last. We had
a. good stock of tea, with which we treated our" friends, and we lived
cheerfully and well, all things considered. -

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the weather
at least tolerable ; so the other travellers began to prepare sledges to carry
them over the snow, and to get things ready to he going ; but my measures
being fixed, as I have said, for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the
Baltic, I made no motion; knowing very well that the ships from the
south do not set out. for that part of the world till May or June, and
that if I was there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon as
any ships would be ready to sail. Therefore I made no haste to be
gone, as others did: in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the
travellers, go away before me. It seems every year they go from thence
to Muscovy for trade, to carry furs, and buy necessaries, which they bring
back with them to furnish their shops: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel.

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up; and, as I
was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these people were banished
by the, Czar to Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty
to go whither they would, why they did not then go away to any part; of the
world, wherever they thought fit: and I began to examine what should
hinder them from making such an attempt. But my wonder was over
when I entered ripen that subject with the person I have mentioned, who

answered me thus : " Consider, first, sir," said he, "the place where we are;
487
and, secondly, the condition we are in; especially the generality of the
people who are banished thither. We are surrounded with stronger things
than bars or bolts; on the north side, an unnaviguhle ocean, where ship
never sailed, and heat never swam ; every other way we have above a thou-
sand miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and by ways utterly
impassable, except by the roads made by the government, and through the
towns garrisoned hy his troops ; in short, we could neither pass undiscovered
by the road, nor subsist. any other way, so that it is in vein to attempt it."

I was silenced at once, and found that they were in a prison every jot
as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at Moscow: however,
it came into my thoughts that T might certainly be made an instrument to
procure the escape of this excellent person; and that, whatever hazard I
run, I would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this, I took
an occasion, one evening, to tell him my thoughts. I represented to him
that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being no guard over
him in the country ; and as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel,
and that I went in the retinuc of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to
lie in the stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where I
would immediately secure him on board an English ship, and carry him
safe along with me; and as to his subsistence and other particulars, it
should be my care till he could better supply himself.

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the while
I spoke ; nay, I could see in his very face that what I said put his spirits
into an exceeding ferment; his colour frequently changed, his eyes looked
red, and his heart fluttered, till it might be even perceived in his coun-
tenance; nor could he immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it
were, hesitated what he would say to it: but after he had paused a little, be
embraced me, and Said, "How unhappy are we, unguarded creatures as we
are, that even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and
we are made tempters of one another? " He then heartily thanked me for
my offers of service, but withstood resolutely the arguments I used to urge
him to set himself free. He declared, in earnest terms, that he was fully
bent on remaining where he was rather than seek to return to his former
miserable greatness, as he called it; where the seeds of pride, ambition,
avarice, and luxury, might revive, take root, and again overwhelm hini.
" Let me remain, dear sir," he said, in conclusion--" let me remain in this

blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life, rather than purchase

future happiness which I now have in my View, but should then, I fear,

If I was surprised before, 1 was quite dumb now, and stood silent,
looking at lnm, and indeed, admiring what. I saw. The struggle in his soul
was so great that. though the weather was extremely cold, it put him into a

489 3 n
most violent hunt ; so I said a word or two, that I would leave him to
consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my own
apartment.

About two hours after, I heard somebody at. or near the door of my room.
and l was going to open the door, but he had opened it- and come in. " My
dear friend," says he, " you had almost overset me, but I an) recovered, Do
not take it ill that I do not close with your oii'er. I assure you it is not for
want of sense of the kindness of it in you ; and I came to make the most
sincere acknowledgment of it to you; but I hope I have got the victory
over myself--"My lord," said I, "I hope you are fully satisfied that you
do not resist the call of Heaven."--"Sir," said he, "if it had been from
Heaven, the same power would have influenced me to have accepted it; but
I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I decline it, and
I have infinite satisfaction in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest
man still, though not a free man."

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to him of
my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me
very passionately, and assured me he was sensible of that, and should
always acknowledge it; and with that he offered me a very fine present of
sables,------too much, indeed, for me to accept from a man in his circumstances,
and I would have avoided them, but he would not be refused. The next
morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a small present of too, and
two pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of J apan gold, which
did not all weigh above six ounces or thereabouts, but were faI short of the
value of his sables, which, when I came to England, 1 found worth near two
hundred pounds. He accepted the tee, and one piece of the damask, and
one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan
coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any
more: and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak with me.

When I came to him, he told me I knew what had passed between us, and
hoped I would not move him any more in that affair; but that, since I had
made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had kindness enough to
offer the same to another poison that he would name to me, in whom he hwd
a great shore of concern. In a word, ho told me it was his only son ; who,
though I had not seen him, was in the same condition with himself, and
above two hundred miles from him. on the other side of the Oby; but that,

if I consented, he would send for him.
490
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made some
ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his account;
and that, seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show my respect
to him by my concern for his son. He sent the next day for his son;
and in about twenty days he came back with the messenger, bringing
six or seven horses, loaded with very rich furs, which, in the. whole,
'amounted to a very great- value His servants brought the horses into
the town, but left the young,r lord at a distance till night, when he came
incognito into our apartment, and his father presented him to me; and,
in short, we concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything proper
for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-skins, fine
crmines, and such other furs as are very rich in that city, in exchange
for some of the goods T had brought from China; in particular for the
cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part here, and the rest
afterwards at. Archangel, for a much better price than I could have got
at London; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose
business, more particularly than mine, was merchandise, was mightily
plcused with our stay, on account of the. traffic we made here.

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place. We were
now reduced to a. very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and
camels in all, which passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor
of eleven of them. It was natural also that I should take more servants
with me than I had before; and the young lord passed for my steward;
what great man I passed for myself, I know not, neither did it concern
me to inquire We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over
that we. met with in our whole journey; I call it the worst, because the
way was very deep in some places, and very uneven in others; the best
we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars or
robbers to fear, as they never came on this side of the river Oby, or at least

I very seldom ; but we found it otherwise.

My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly
acquainted with the country, and led us by private roads, so that we
avoided coming into the principal towns and cities upon the great read.
such as Tumon, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others ; because the Musca-
vitc garrisons which are kept there are vex)r curious and strict in their

obscuration upon travellers, and searching lest any of the banished persons
or
of note should make their use-ape that way into Museovy; but, by this
means, as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a
desert, and we were ohl'ged to encnmp and lie in our tents, when we might
have had very good accommodation in the cities on the way ; this the
young lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad
when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his
servant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed places.

We had just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, which in
these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia, and the first city on
the European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, that is, the great city on
the river Kama. And here we thought to see some evident alteration in the
people ; but we were mistaken ; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which
is near seven hundred miles long in some places, but not above. two
hundred miles over where we passed it, so, till we came past that horrible
place, we found very little difference between that country and Mogul
Tartary. The people are mostly Pagans; their houses and towns full of
idols; and their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities, and
the villages near them, where they are Christians, us they call themselves,
of the Greek church : but have their religion mingled with so many relics
of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some places from more
sorcery and witchcraft

In passing this forest (after all our dangers were to our imagination,
escaped), I thought, indeed, we must have been plundered and robbed, and
perhaps murdered, by a. troop of thieves : of what country they were, I am
yet at a loss to know; but they were all on horseback, carried bows and
arrows, and were at first about forty-five in number. They came so nexu- to
us as to be within two musket-shot, and, asking no questions, surrounded
us with their horses, and looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length,
they placed themselves just in our way ; upon which we drew up in a little
line, before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all Thus drawn
up, we. halted, and sent out the Siberian servant, who attended his lord,
to see who they were; his muster was the more willing to let him go,
because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian troop
sent out after him. The man came up near them with a flag of truce, and
called to them ; but though he spoke several of their languages, or dialects
of languages rut-her, he could not understand a word they Suid; however,

after some signs to him not to come near them at his peril, the fellow came
492 '
back no wiser than he went; only that by their dress, he said, he believed
them to be some Tarmrs of Kolmuck, or of the Circassian hordes, and that
there must be more of them upon the great desert, though he never heard
that any of them were seen so far north before.

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy: there was
on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a. little grove, and
very near the road. I immediately resolved we should advance to those
trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could thew. ; for, first. I considered

 

nu: Min-AM um nrr mo common.

that the trees would in a great measure cover us from their arrows ; and, in
the next place, they could not come to charge us in a body : it was, indeed,
my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this cxoollency
attending him, that he was always readicst and west apt, to direct and
encourage us in cases of the most danger. We advanced immediately,
with wlmt speed we could, and gained that little wood; the 'I'urturs, or
thieves, for we know not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not

attempting to hinder us When We came thither, we found. to our great
'93
satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece of ground, and on the one side a
very grout spring of water, which, running out in a little brook, was a.
little farther joined by another of the like size; and was, in short, the
source of a considerable river, called afterwards the Wirtska; the trees
which grew about this spring were not above two hundred, but very large,
and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves
perl'eelzly safe from the enemy unless they attacked us on foot.

While we stayed here waiting lhc motion of the enemy some hours,
without perceiving that they made any movement. our Portuguese, with
some help, out several arms of trees half oil, and laid them hanging across
from one tree to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About two hours
before night, they came down directly upon us; and though we had not
perceived it, we found they had been joined by some more, so that they
were near four-score horse ; whereof, however, we fancied some were women.
They came on till they were within half-shot of our little wood, when we
fired one musket without ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue to
know what they wanted, and bade them keep off ; but they come on with a
double fury up to the wood side, not imagining we were so barricaded that
they could not easily break in. Our old pilot was our captain, as well as our
engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till they came within pistol-
shot, that we might be sure to kill, and that when we did the we should be
sure to take good aim ; we bade him give the word of command, which he
delayed so long, that they were some of them within two pikes' length of
us when we let fly. We aimed so true, that We killed fourteen of them,
and wounded several others, as also several of their horses; for we had all
of us loaded our pieces with two or three bullets apiece at least.

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immediately
about one hundred rods from us; in which time we loaded our pieces again,
and seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and caught four or fire
of their horses, whose riders we supposed were killed; and coming up to
the deed, we judged they were Tutors, but knew not how they come to
make an excursion such an unusual length.

About an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us, and rode
round our little wood to see where they might break in; but. finding us
always remlv to face them, they went off again ; and we resolved not to stir
for that night.

We slept little, but spent the most part; of the night in strengthening
494
our situation, and barricading the entrances into the wood, and keeping a
strict watch. We waited for daylight. and when it came, it gave us a
very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the enemy, who we thought were
discouraged with the receptionthey met with, were now greatly increased,
and had set up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were resolved to
bosicge us; and this little camp they had pitched upon the open plain,
about three-quarters of a mile from us. i confess. I now gave myself
over for lost, and all that I had; the loss of my effects did not lie so nonr
me, though very considerable, as the thoughts of falling into the hands
of such barbarians, at the latter end of my journey, after so many
difficulties and hazards as 1 had gone through, and even in sight of our
port, where we expected safety and deliverance. As to my partner, he
was raging, and declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin, and
that he would rather die than be starved, and he was for fighting to
the last drop.

The young lord, a most gallant youth, was for fighting to the last also;
and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist them all in the
situation we were then in. Thus we spent the day in debates of what we
should do ; but towards evening we found that the number of our enemies
still increased, and we did not know but by the morning they might still
he a greater number ; so I began to inquire of those people we had brought
from 'l'obolski, if there were 'no private ways by which we might avoid
them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard
us over the desert. The young lord's Siberian servant told us, if we
designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to carry us 013' in
the night, to a way that went north, towards the river Petrnz, by which he
made no question but we might get away, and the Tartars never discover
it; but, he said, his lord had told him he would not. retreat, but would
rather choose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord; for that he was too
wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it; that I knew he was brave
enough, by what he had showed already ; but thnt- he knew better than to
desire seventeen or eighteen men to tight five hundred, unless an unavoid-
able necessity forced them to it ; and that if he thought it possible for us
to escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He
answered, if his lordship gave him such orders, he would lose his life if he
did not. perform it; we soon brought his lord to give that Older, though
privately, and we immediately prepared for putting it in practice.

495
'And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in our little
:amp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all night,
that the Tartars 1n ight- conclude we were still there ; but as soon as it was
dark, and we could see the stars (for our guide would not stir before),
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we followed our new guide,
who I soon feuud steered himself by the north star, the country being level
fora long way. '

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be lighter still ;
not that it was dark all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in short,
it was rather lighter than we wished it to be ; but by six o'clock the next
morning, we had got above thirty miles, having almost spoiled our horses.
Here we found a. Russian village, named" Kernzazinskoy, where we rested,
and heard nothing of the Kalmuek 'I'artars that day. About two hours
before night, we set out again, and travelled till eight the next morning,
though not quite so hard as before; and about seven o'clock, we passed a
little river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large town inhabited by
Russians, called Ozomys; there we heard that several troops of Kalxnucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now completely out of
danger of them, which was to our great satisfaction. Here we were obliged
to get some fresh horses, and having need enough of rest, we stayed five
days; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian who
conducted us thither the value of ten pistoles.

In five days more we came to Veussimn. upon the river Witzogda, and
running into the Dwina: we were there, very happily, near the end of our
travels by land, that river being navigable, in seven (lays' passage, to
Archangel. From hence, we came to Lawrenslcoy, the 3d of July; and,
providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a. barge for our own
convenience, we. embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe ut Archangel the
18th; having been a year, five months, and three days on the journey,
includig our stay of about eight months at Tobolski. '

W'e were obliged to slay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the
ships, and must have larried longer, had not a Haniburgher come in above
.1 month sooner than any of the English ships ; when, after some considera-
tion that the city of Harnburgh might happen to he as good a. market for
our goods as London, we all took freight with him; and, having put our
goods on board, it- was most natural for me to put my steward on board to

take care of them; by which means, my young lord had a sulficient
496
opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore again all the time
we stayed there; and this he did that he might not be seen in the city,
where some of the Moseow merchants would certainly have seen and
discovered him.

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same year;
and, afterno extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the Elbe the 18611 of

To conclude: having stayed near four menu's in Hamburgh, I came
from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and
arrived in London the mm of January, 1705, having been absent from
England ten years and nine months. And here, resolving to harass myself
no more, I am preparing for a longer journey than all these, having lived
seventy-two years a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know
the value of rethement, and the blessing of' ending our days in peace.
