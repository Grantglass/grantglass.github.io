  CRUSOE FINDS HIS SHIP DRIVEN CLOSE TO THE SHORE
ROBINSON CRUSOE'S father was a merch-
ant in a foreign country, and Crusoe when
young ran away from home to be a sailor, but
in later years he regretted his conduct.
One night the ship he was on, was overtaken
by a violent storm and the crew tried to save
themselves in a small boat; but the fury of the
storm overturned their small boat and all but
Robinson Crusoe were drowned. Crusoe who
was a powerful swimmer battled in the water
until he finally reached shore almost exhausted.
He looked about him for help that he might get
some food or water, but could see none. He
was afraid of cannibals or wild animals and slept
that night in the branches of a tree.
In the morning when he looked around he
saw his ship wrecked, but floating quite near
the shore, and he also found that he was on an
island without signs of a human being but
himself.
   \\J)
RUSOE needed food and clothes and decided to
swim out to the wreck to get them if by chance
the r were not washed away. He waited until the tide
had ebbed and then swam out and climbed aboard.
Great was his joy when he discovered many things
in the bow of the boat that were dry and in good
condition. He gathered up some clothes, a box of tools,
some powder and shot, guns and a pistol, and all the
food he found. They had a dog and two cats aboard
and Crusoe found these frightened animals safe in a
corner of the boat. They showed signs of being pleased
at seeing him and he decided to take them ashore.
Now all that he needed was a boat to take his
•„•*"*
things ashore, but as there was none to be had he set
to work and made a raft by tieing loose planks together;
with this he managed to get all his things ashore saf ej^.
 CRUSOE MAKES CLOTHES FOR HIMSELF
/CRUSOE made several trips to the wreck
^ and carried off every useful thing he found.
His next thought was about a house to live in.
He picked out a green spot upon the side of a
hill of rock and here he drove stakes in the
ground in the form of a half circle round a little
cave in the rock. He covered the top and sides
of this enclosure with tarpaulin and placed his
tent within it. He soon made his cave larger
by digging and made things quite comfortable
within. He moved in all the things he had tak-
en off the wreck and hung up a hammock for
his bed. He took this hammock off the wreck,
it was one that the sailors slept in.
He made furniture such as a table and chair
and even made his own clothing.
In order to get into his hut Crusoe had to
climb up a ladder to get over the fence and when
he was in he lifted the ladder after him. He had
to have such a fence around his hut in order to
keep out the wild animals.

 CRUSOE DIGGING OUT A DOCK
ROM one side of the island Crusoe could look
*• across the water and see the mainland at a
distance. This sight filled him with longing for
a boat in which he could go out to sea and reach
some point where he might find means to get
back to his friends.
He was determined to try and make a canoe,
such as the Indians made out of the trunk of a
tree. He chose a tree near the water and after
many wearying strokes he finally brought the
tree down. He next set to work to cut and hew
it into the shape of a boat. The boat finished,
his next task was to take it to the sea but he
found he could not carry it, so he had to dig out
a dock, and this meant much more labor, but he
knew in the end he would be rewarded with a
boat in which to go off to sea. When the tide
rose he floated his boat and was overjoyed to
to see it remain upright in the water.
 CRUSOE MAKES A TRIP ROUND THE ISLAND
WHEN Crusoe got his boat to sea, he was
eager to get in her and make a trip
around the island, to see how she went in the
water. He fitted her up for a voyage: He put
a small mast in her and made a sail out of one
that he had taken from the ship; he made some
boxes in which to put food, powder and shot
Taking his gun along, he set out in his boat to
sail around the island. He got a fairly good
start and was half way around when he came to
a great ledge of rocks partly covered by water,
and beyond these was a stretch of sand shoal.
In trying to get around this he was carried far
out to sea by the strong current and could not
get back until the tide changed and carried him
in. He would take no further chances in this
small boat, so he found a good place to hide it
and then took off all the food he had brought
along, and with his umbrella and gun set off for
his hut
   RUSOE had quite enough of the sea, for li.e v
\\J/ was still fresh in his rv*:>

 THE PRISONER ESCAPING FROM THE CANNIBALS
CRUSOE'S mind was full of frightful ideas
^ and fancies about that foot print, and the
dread of falling into the hands of cannibals so
possessed him that he did not go out of his hut
for days. At last it struck him that this foot
print might be his own and the thought lessened
his fear until by degrees his courage returned
and he ventured out.
One day he saw five boats afloat quite near
his hut and on the beach were many savages,
who evidently came to the island to hold a feast
for they sat around a fire eating. Suddenly one
from their number ran away and several gave
chase after him. Crusoe watched all this from
behind a large rock and the savage was making
directly for this rock. He out-ran his pursuers
and Crusoe stopped him when he reached the
rock, and made motions that he intended no
harm, and the savage understood and went off
with him to his hut.

 RID AY was the name Crusoe gave to this man
,^L because he rescued him on that day. Friday
explained in his own way that he had escaped from
a tribe of cannibals.
Crusoe taught Friday how to talk and, above all,
to eat and wear clothes as the white men do. It was
not an easy task, but Crusoe taught Friday so well
that he was of great help in building a second and
larger boat, in which Crusoe had intended to sail to
the mainland.
One day later on the cannibals came back to the
island and this time Crusoe and Friday rescued a white
man, who was a Spaniard, and also a black man who,
to the great joy of Friday, he found was his own father.
The Spaniard told of his comrades who were ship-
wrecked and were now on the mainland and Crusoe
sent Friday's father and the Spaniard off in the new
boat in search of them.

 CRUSOE WATCHES THE MEN FROM THE ENGLISH SHIP
WHILE the Spaniard and Friday's father
were off to the mainland Crusoe dis-
covered a great ship anchored near the shore
and a small boat on the beach. Several men
got out of the small boat and seemed to be lead-
ing prisoners. After tying the hands and feet
of their prisoners these men lay down to sleep
and Crusoe and Friday crept up to the three
prisoners and Crusoe spoke to them. They ex-
plained that they were captain and mates of the
big ship and the others were mutineers who had
overpowered them and taken possession of the
ship. Crusoe made the captain promise to bring
him back to his native land before he would
rescue him and his mates. This they willingly
did and Crusoe and Friday who had guns easily
overpowered the mutineers and restored the ship
to the captain.
Crusoe and Friday sailed away casting many
a longing backward glance at their island.
