644WAS born in the year 1682,1n the city of York: of a' f -'
a good family, though not of that country, my father ,
- being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He
got a good estate by merchandise, and, leaving off his trade,
lived afterwards at York; from whence he had married
V my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a
very good family in that country, and from whom I was ,
.7 called Robimon Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption ' '
-' - of words in England, we are now called, nay, we call,
ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe,- and so my com-r. :
panions always called me. + >>
n =1 had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant.
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, fowl
merly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and" ' .~:f:'
-. was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Span-3' -
iards. , What became of my second brotherInever knew, . ,
; any mere than my father and mother did know what '
~ was become of me. -
:2 Being the third son of the family and not bred to any
. trade, my head beg an to be filled37 very early with ramb-
,_ ling thoughts. . My father, who was very ancient, had
' given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-
education and a country free school generally go, and
designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with
' nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led ' A

me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my.
father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of
my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that propension of nature, tending
directly to the life of misery which "was to befall me.
' My father, a wise and grave man,"gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he
" was'confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly
:with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons,
more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leav-
ing my father's house andmy native country; where 1
might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising
_ ,my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease
and pleasure: u--He told me it was only men of desperate
fortunes on "the one hand, or of aspiring superior
' _ fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adven-
, tures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous
. invundertakings of a nature out of the common road;
L; that these things were all either too far above me, or too
, far below me ;' and that mine was the middle state, or

  
    
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
  
   
  

which he had found; by long experience, was the best
state in the world the most suited to human happiness,
not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the"labour and
sufi'erings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not
embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He, told :me I might
judge of the happiness of this stateiby this. one thing,
-viz.,' that this was the state of life which all other people
envied ; that kings had frequently lamented the miserable
: ' consequences of being born to great things, and wished
?, they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
, ' between_the mean andthe great ;I that the: Wise Man
, gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of true
' , felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches;
He He bade 'me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the upper
and lower part of mankind; but that the middle station

many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of man-
,; kind: nay," they were not subjected to so many distem-
1 pers and uneasiness, either of body or mind, as those
were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and ex travagances,
on one hand, or by hardvlabour, want of necessaries, and
mean and insufiicient diet, on the other hand, bring disd '
5 tempers upon themselves by the natural consequences of
'2, their way of living; that the .middle station of life was
calculated for all kind of virtues,'and all kind of enjoys
ments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a
' middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness,
health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desire
able pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle 17'
station of life; thatthisway men went silently and smooth- , >>' '
1y through the world, and comfortably out of it; not em-
narrasSed with the labours'of the hands or of the head;
not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, or harrassed'
withperplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace
and the body of rest; not enraged with the passion oi
envy, ~or'the secret burning'lust of ambition for great a
things--but in easy circumstances, sliding gently through ,
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living with; ;
out the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning,
by every day's experience, to know it more sensibly;
After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, or to -
precipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided,
against--that I was under no necessity of seeking my.
4" breadethat he would do well for me, and endeavour to '

, enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been .
just recommending to me; and that, if I was not very a;
easy and happy in the world, it must be my ,mere fate, "
or fault, that must hinder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty,
in warning me against measures which he knew would be
to my hurt: In a, word, that as he would do very ldnd
things for me, if I' would stay and settle at home as he
directed, so he would not have so much hand in my mis- .
fortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away4% V mm AND ADVENTURES or Remusou causes;-

"~--:--and,' to close all,'he told me, I had my elderbrothen.
' for my example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country
wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting
him to run into :the army, wheres-he, was killed--and

' though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he,

would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish
step, God would not bless me--and I would have leisure

, hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel,

when there might be none to assist in my recovery. '

. I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know
it to be so himself--I say, I_observed the tears rtm down
his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my
brother who was killed; and that when he spoke of my
havingleisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was
,so moved that he broke off the discourse, and toldme his
heart was so full he could say no more to me. '

; h, I was sincerely afflicted with ,this discourse-was, 1n
' deed, who could be otherwise ?---and I resolved .not to
" think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home ac>>

' cording to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days wore
it all off; and, in "short, to prevent any of my father's

, further importunities, in a few weeks after, I resolved to
' .1 run quite away from him. However, I did not act so hastily
Lneither, as the first heat of my resolution prompted,

- but I took my mother at a tune when I thought her a

*> little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her>> that my
thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that.

" I should never settle to anything with resolution enough
.. to go through with it, and my father had better give me;
" his consent, than force'me to go without it--that I was
' now eighteen years old, which was too late to go appren-
' tice'to a trade, or clerk to- an attorney, that I was sure if

I did, I should never serve out my time, but .I should ,-
certainly run away from my master before my time was
out, and go to sea--and if she would speak to my father to
let me go one voyage abroad, if I'came home again, and
did not like it, I would go no more, and I. would promise,
by double diligence, to recover the time I had lost. _ y

I11:} {A ' suns ros LONDON." ..

 

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father
upon any such subject--that he knew too well what was
my interest, to. give his consent to any such thing so
much for my hurt--and that she wondered how I could
think of any such thing, after the discourse I had had
with my father, and such kind and tender expressions as
she knew my father had used to me--and that, in short,
if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I
might depend I should never have their consent to it--
that, for her part, she would not have so much hand in
my destructioneand I should never have it to say, that .
my mother was willing when my father was not. _
{a Though- my mother refused to move it to my father, ,
yet I heard afterwards, that sh'ereportedall the discourse
0 him: and that my father, after showing a great con-
cern at it, said to her, with a sigh, " That boy might be
happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad,
he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born .

&"--I can give no consent to it." '
- .>> It was not till almost a year after this that I broke"

 

deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and fre-
quently expost'ulati'ng with my father and mother about
their being so positively determined against what they '
knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one
day at Hull, whither I went casually, and without any '
urpose of making an elopement that time--but, I say,
being there, and one of my companions being going by
sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me .
to go. with him, with the common allurement of a sea-
faring man, that it should cost me nothing for my pas-
sage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more,
nor so much as sent them ,word of it; but leaving them
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's bless-
ing or my father's, without any consideration of circum-
stances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows,
on the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for Londom - Never any young adventurer's misc,

than miner? The ship was no sooner got out of the Hum-
ber, than the wind began to blow, and the sea to rise in a
most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea

- before, I was most .inexpressibly sick in body, and ter-

rified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon
what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the
judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's
house, and abandoning my duty; all the good counsel of
my parents, my father's tears, and my mother's entreaties,
came now fresh into my mind ; and my conscience, which
was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has
been since, reproached me with the centempt of advice,
and the breach of my duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went
very high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since--no, nor what I saw a few days after: but it

' was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor,

and had never known anything of the matter. ' I expected
every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every

7 "time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough
'. or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more. In this
; agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that

if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage,

if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would
go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship

again while I lived ; but I would take his advice, and never .
run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now

I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the
middle station of life, how easy, how comfortable he had,

. lived all his days, and never had been exposed-to tem-

pests at sea, nor trouble on shore; and, in short, I re-
solved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go

"home to my father.- -' _ .
' 1's These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while

the storm continued, and indeed some time after ;' but
the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer,
and I began to be a little inured to it. However, I was

' very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick

still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind
was quite over, and a charmingtfine evening followed;the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next
1:>> morning: and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea,
. the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the
, most delightful that ever I saw. - ,
.2 a: I had slept well in thenight, and was now no more sea:
2 sick, but very cheerful--elooking with wonder upon the
sea, that was so rough and terrible the dayjbefore, and
" could be so calm and so pleasant in so littleagtime after: '
7' and now, lest my good resolutions should continua-my
_ companion, who had indeed enticed me away, comes to"
; mess" Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoul-

, 'ened, weren't you, last night, when it blew but a capful
: of wind?'~2.; "A capful d'ye call it?" said I, 5i'twas a
= terrible storm."r;<<-'_>>' A storm, you fool you !, ','. replies he, ,
,'do you call that a storm?! ,why it was nothing at all;

- of such a squall of wind as that; but you're but a fresh-
, water sailor, Bob; come, let us make a bowl of punch,
'- and we'll forget all that : d'ye see what charming weather
2:.jtis now? " To make short this sad part of my story, we
vwent the way of all sailors; the punchvwas made, and I
;.was made half drunk with it, and in that one night's
mwickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflec-
< tions upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the
future. In 'a word, as the sea was returned to its smooth-_
; ness of surface, and settled calmness, by the abatement of
. that storm, so, the hurry of my thoughts being over, my
I fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by thesea
3 being forgotten, and the current of myufermer desires
: returned,,I entirely forgot the vows and'promises that I
3.:made in my distress. 1 found, indeed, some intervals of'
" reflection ; and the serious thoughts did, as it Were, ens '
.deavour toreturn again sometimes; but I shook them off,

: der, " how do you do after it '2 I warrant you were fright- '
trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally -
it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for
if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to
be such an one, as the worst and most hardened wretch
among us would confess both the danger and the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into Yar-
mouth roads; the wind having been contrary and the
weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm.

' Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we
lay, the wind continuing contrary, namely, at south-west,
for seven or eight days; during which time a great many
ships from Newcastle came in to the same roads, as the
common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind
for the river.

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh;
and after we had lain four or five days, blewvery hard.
However, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour,
.the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong,

dour men were unconcerned, and not in the least appre-
>> hensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth,
-- after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the
- ' morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at
work to strike our top-masts, and make everything snug

' and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible.
By noon, the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rid
forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or
twice our anchor had come home ; upon which our master
ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two
anchors a--head, and the cables veered out to the better end.

,;-.. By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now

.- I began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of
the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in

~ the business of preserving the ship, yet, as he went in and
out of his cabin by me, I could hear him, softly to himself,
fsay several times, "Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be

- Tall lost--we shall be all undone I" and the like. During .
'these'first hurries, I was stupid, lying still in my cabin,
(which was in the steerage, and cannot. describe my tem-

' 'per. I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so53'" _VIOLENT s'ronm AT SEA. 9

 

apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against:
I thought the bitterness of death had been past ; and that
this would be nothing, too, like the first. But when the
master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said
we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I got up
' -" out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight
I never saw: the sea went mountains high, and broke
s upon us every three or four minutes; when I could look
about, I could see nothing but distress round us. Two
'ships that rid near us, we found, had cut their masts by
the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that
>> a ship, which rid about a mile a-head of us, was found-
ereda Two more ships, being driven from their anchors,
were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and
that with not a mast standing. The light ships fared the
best,_as not so much labouring in the sea} but him or
three of them drove, and came close by us, running away
j with only their sprit sail out before the wind.

' 1 Towards the evening, the mate and boatswa'in begged
, the master of our ship to let them cut away the foremast,
. which he was very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain pro-
>> testing to him; that if he did not the ship would founder,
' he consented; and when they had cut away the foremast, '
p the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much,

' they were obliged to cut it away also, and make a clear deck.

: Any one must judge what a condition I must be in at
all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in
such a fright before at but a little. But if I can express
. at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, '
was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my
r former convictions, and the having returned from them
to the' resolutions I had wickedly taken at first", than I
. was'at death itself; and these, added to the terror of the
5 storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by no
' words describe it. But the'worst was not come yet; the
-, storm continued with such fury that the seamen them-

' elves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. ~' We ,
had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in
the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried out she

 

 

i~ would founder. c; It was, my advantage, in one-respect. ' 7 r,10 mt. AND ADVENTURES er sonmsou causon. .

that I did not know what they meant by founder, till I
inquired.- However, the storm was so violent, that I saw,
what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and
some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers,
and expecting every moment when .<<the ship would go to
the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all
therest of our distresses, one of the men that had been
down on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung aleak;
another said there was four feet water in the hold. Then
all hands were called to the pump. At that very word,
my heart, as I thought, died within me; and I fell back--
wards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin.
However, the men roused me, and told me,' that I that
was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as
~ another; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the
storm, were obliged to slip and run away to the sea, and
_ would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of
' distress; I, who knew nothing what that meant, was so
. surprised, that I thought the ship had,broke, or some
,. dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised

' that I fell down in a swoon. . As this was a time when

everybody had his own life to think of, nobodyminded me, ,

' ' or what was become of me; but another man steppedup
. to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me
a lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while
,2 before I came to myself. V - .
,_ a>> We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it
, was apparent that the ship would founder; and though
- the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not pos-
.sible she could swim till we might run into a port, so the
master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship,
who had rid it out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out
5 to help us. .It was with the utmost hazard the boat came
. near us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or
for the boat to lie near the ship side, till at last the men
: rowing very heartily, 'and'venturing their lives to save

ours, our men cast them a rope over the stem with a buoy V

to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they,after much labour and hazard, tookhold of, and we hauled
v them close under our stern, and got all into their boat.
>> It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the
boat, to think of reaching to their own ship ; so all agreed
-to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as
as much as we could; and our master promised them, _
_ that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it
' good to their master: so, partly rowing, and partly driv-
'ing, our boat went away to the northward, sloping to-
wards the shore, aln'mst as far as Winterton Ness.

v We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out
. of our ship, but we saw her sink: and then I understood
for the first time, what was meant by a ship foundering
. in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look ,
' up, when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from
; that moment they rather put me into the heat, than that '
L I might be said to' go in, my heart was, as it were, dead
within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me. '
' a While we were in this condition, the men yet labour-
~ ing at the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could
' see (when our boat mounting the waves, we were able to
see the shore) a great- many people running along the
{shore to assist us, when we should come near; but we
' made but slow way towards the shore, nor were we able
; to reach the shore, till being past the light-house at Win-
' terton, the shore falls oil to the westward towards Cro-
; mer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the
wind, Here we got in, and, though not without much
, difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on
_' foot to Yarmouth, where,'as unfortunate men, we were
' used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
he town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular
merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us
= sufficient to carry us either to London, or back to Hull,
as we thought fit. - . . a .

- before he had any assurance that I was not drowned.

' But my ill fate pushed me on now with a obstinacy
that nothing could resist: and though I had several times
loud calls from my reason and my more composed judg-
ment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know
not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret,
overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instm-
ments ofg our own destruction, even though it be before
us, and that we push upon it with our eyes open. Cer-
tainly ,nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery

. attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape,
could have pushed me forward against the calm reason-
Lugs 9nd persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible instructions as I had met with
'n my first attempt-

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
g ' whoy was the master's son, was now less forward than I.
' 'The first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth,
which was not till two or three days, for we were separated
in the town to several quarters--I say, the first time he
saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and looking '
5v ery melancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I
,did: and telling his father who I was, and how I had
come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad, his father, turning to me with a very grave and
, concerned tone, ." Young man," says he, "you 'ought
never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for
a plain and visible token, that you are not to be a sea-
fearing man.' "Why y, sir," said 1, "will you go to sea
no more 2 " " That is another case,' '-said he, "it is my
calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made this
voy yage for a trial,y on see what ataste Heaven has given 7
you of what you are yto expect, if you persist. '1 perhaps all
' this has befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the
ship of Tarshish. Pra y," continues he, "what are you?
and on what account did you 0 to sea 2" Up on thatI
told him some of my story'-y , at e end of which he burst
:3 ' :out with astran gekind of passion: "What had I done,"
" says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come in-macs nousrs as T0 nnruanm'e HOME. . . 13

to my :ship ? I would not set my foot in the same ship
- withy theep again for athousand pounds." This indeed was,

asIsaid, anexcursion of the s pirits,which were yet agitated
by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could

 

have authority to go. However, he afterwards talked

(w, .

  
  
   
 
 
   
   
   
  
   
  
   
   
   
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
  

rygravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my father
and not temp t Providence to my ruin; told me, I might
;.see a visible hand of Heaven against me: "And,y young
2 man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back,

wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but dis-
; asters and disappointments, till your father' s words are
ulfilled upon you.'

31. We parted soon after; for I made him little answer,
, and I saw him no more: which way he went I know not.

i As for me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled.
.: to London by land; and there, as well as on the road,

" had many strug gles with my self, what course of life I
should take, angd gwhether I should go home or go to sea,
= As to going ghome, shame opposedg the best motions that
'3 ofi'eredtomy thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me
now I should be lgaug hed at among the neighbours, and
should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only

:j but even everybody else, from whence I have since often
' observed, how incongruous and irrational the common
temp er of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason
which ought to guide them in such cases, namely, that
they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to re--I
pent, nor ashamed of the action for which they oug ht:
ustly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of ythe re-

: turniyng, which only can make them be esteemed wise men.

-:; In this state ofy life, however, I remained some time,

 

- to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going
home; and as I stay ed a while, the remembrance of the
distress I had been in were OE; and, as that abated, the
little motion I had in my desires to a return wore ofi with
it, til] at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it; and
looked out for a voyage. '14.: ,

That evil influence which carried me first away fiom my
father' a house, that hurried me into the wild and indi-

uncertain what measures to take, and what course (if-liter
_ \, gested notion of raising my fortune, and that impressed

' those conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make deaf me to

5. all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the com-
? mand of my father--I say, the same influence, whatever
it was, presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises _

- to my view;- and I went on board a vessel bound to the
' coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voy-

age to Guinea.

-It was my great misfortune, that in all these adven-
tures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though
I might indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary,
yet, at the same time, I had learned the duty and office
of a fore-mastman, and in time might have qualified my-
self for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But
as it was always my fate _to choose for the worst, so I did
here, for, having money in my pocket, and good clothes -
upon my back, I would always go on board' in the habit
of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the
ship, nor learned to do any.

 

 

    
 

, oHAPTEB II.

9 - Ir was my lot, first of all to fall into pretty good company
in London, which does not always happen to such loose
and unguided young fellows as Ithen was, the devil gene- -
,. rally not omitting to lay some snare for them very egarly ,
, but it was not so with me. I first fell acquainted with '

., the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea , -
.: and who ,having had very good success there, was resolved
3 to go again, and who, taking a fancy to my conversation,
. which was not at all disagreeable ayt that time, hearing
' 4 ".me say I had amind to see a'grthe world, told me, if I would

, go the voyage with him I should be at no expenses-I
'- should be his mess-mate and his companion , and if I

. could carry any thing with me, I shouldhave all the ad-
vantage of it that the trade would admit, and, perhaps,
I might meet with some encouragement.1:2: I embraced the offer; and, entering into a strict friend-
ship with this captain, who was an honest and plain-
' l H dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried a
small adventure with .me, :which, by the disinterested
' honesty of my friend, the captain, I increased very con-
' siderably; for I carried about forty pounds in such toys
and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This forty
2 .pounds I had mustered together by the assistance of
4'; some of my relations, whom I corresponded'with,.and
who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to .
' contribute so much as that to my first adventure. _
c '4' This was the only voyage which I may say was success-
' ful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity
' and honesty of my friend, the captain ?;-' under whom also.
; I got a competent lmowledge of the mathematics, and the
g rules of navigation--learned how to keep an account of
f the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, to ,
- understand some things that were needfulto be understood
' by a sailor; for, as he took delight to instruct me, Itook
i' delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant: for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which
5 yielded me in London, at my return, almost three hun-
V dred pounds; and this filled me with those aspiring '
', thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. - ,
' Yet, even in this voyage, I had my'misfortunes too;
, particularly that I was continually sick, being thrown into
'a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate
';--our principal trading being upon the coast, from the
_ latitude of fifteen degrees north, even to the Line itself.
" ,2. I was now set up for 9. Guinea trader; and my friend,
f to my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I rei
E solved to go the same voyage again; and I embarked in
i' the same vessel with one who was his mate inthe former
_1 voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This
' was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for ,
3 though I did not carry "quite PS100 of my new gained
wealth, so that I had PS200 left, and which I lodged with
. my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell
i into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first was
'__ V r 5 1.; p: g. A, _
- thiss--namely, our ship, making her course towards the
m Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and the
African shore, was surprised, in the grey of the morning,
by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with
all the ,sail she could make. y We crowded also as much
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to
have got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to fight, our ship having twelve guns, and the
rover eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came
up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our
quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we
brought eight>> of our guns to bear on that side, and poured
in a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again
after returning our fire, and pouringin also his small shot
from near two hundred men which he had on board. '
However, we had not a man touched, all our menikeep-
ing close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to de-
fend ourselves ; but laying us on board the next time upon
our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks,

L who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and
rigging. We plied them-with small shot, half-pikes, pow-
der-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them
twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our

' - story,'our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed,

' and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car-
ried all prisoners into Sallee, aport belonging to the Moors.

I; . r? The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first;
I apprehended: nor was I carried up the country to the

' _' emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but was

   

' kept by the captain of the rover, as his proper prize, and
Jimade his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his
; ' business. At this surprising change of my circumstances, .
from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly
: overwhelmed, and now I looked back up on my father' s
' prop phetio discourse to me, that I should be miserable,
and have none to relieve me; which I thought was now
so efi'ectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse--

. that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and Iwas
undone without redemption. But. alas! this was but ataste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in
the sequel of this story. ' .

.-;- As my new patron or master had taken me home to his
house, so Itwas in hopes that he would take me with him
when he went to sea again, believing that it would be some
time or other his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal
,5. man-of-'war, and that then I should be set at liberty.

' ' But this nope of mine was soon taken away; for when
he went to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little _

house; and when he came home againfrom his cruise,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look after the ship.
7-. Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to effect it; but found no way that
had the least probabilityin it. Nothing presented to make
the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to com-
municate it to that would embark with met--no fellow
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there,
,but myself; so that for two years, though I often pleased
myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least
encouraging prospect of puting it in practice.
1:4 After about two years, an odd circumstance presented
7 . itself, whichput the old thought of making some attempt
~ for my liberty again in my head: mypatron lying at home
'longer than usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as
I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once
or twice a-week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was
fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road
a-fishing; and as he always took me and a young Morescc
with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
' I proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that
sometima he would send me with a Moor, one of his
kinsmen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they called him,
' to catch a dish of fish for him. -
It happened one time that going a-fishing with him in
a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were,
not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and
- rowing we knew not whither, or which way, we laboured
1 all day, and all the next night; and when the morning
~ came, we found we had pulled off to sea, instead of pull-

'ing in for the shore, and that we were at least two leagues

a great deal 'of labour, and some danger, for. the wind
began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but, particu-
larly, we were all very hungry. ' ,
'3' But our. patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to
take more care of hinmelf for the future ; and having lying
by him the long-boat of our English ship which he had
taken; he resolved he would not go a-fishing'any more
without a compass and some provision; so he- ordered
the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English slave,
to build a little state-room or cabin in the middle of' the
long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand be-
hind it to steer, and haul home the mainsheet; and room
before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.
She'sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail;
and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which lay
very snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with
a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small
_ lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought
' fit to drink, particularly his bread, rice, and codes.
[as.We were frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and
as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never
_ went without me. a; It happened one .day, that he had ap-
pointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for
i~ fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction, and for
whom he had provided extraordinary; and had therefore
sent on board the boat over night a larger store of pro-
visions than usual, and had ordered me to get ready three
' ' fusils with powder and shot, which were on board his
ship ;_ for that they designed some sport of fowling as Well
-- as fishing; .. , ~ '_' 2 ' " =" ~" '
1.; I got all things ready as he had directedy'and waited
the next morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient
and pendants out,' and everything totaccommodate his
guests; when by and by my patron came on board alone;
and told me his guests had put off going, upon some
business that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and
,3; boy,- as usual, to go out with the boat, and catch them
'3 some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house ;

he commanded me, too, that as soon as I had got some
fish, I should bring it home to his house: all which I
prepared to dwelt 7-7: <<m ._ ' _
- This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a
little ship at my command :7 and my master being gone,
I prepared to furnish myself, 'not for fishing business, but
for a voyage, though I knew not, neither did I so much
as consider, whither I would steer; for anywhere to get
out of that place was my way. .
'- 3i My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board;
for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's
breadt-- He said, that was true; so he-brought a large
basket of rusk, or biscuit of their kind, and three jars with
fresh water into the boat? I knew where my patron's:
' case of bottles stood, which it was evident by the make
.39. were taken out of some English prize, and I conveyed
_ them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they. A _
'- had been there before for our master: I conveyed also a, '
great lump of bees'-wax into the boat, which weighed '
, above half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were
of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make '
candles. r Another trick I tried upon him, which he in-v
nocently came into also; His name was Ishmael, whom
they called Muly or Moley ; so I called to him: " Moley,"
, said I, 1' our patron's guns are on board the beat; can you
not get a little powder and shot ? It may be we may kill-
some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves for
I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the s 'p." " Yes,
>> says he, :" I'll bring some ;" and accordingly he brought a
great leather pouch, which held about a pound and a half
of powder, or rather more, and another with shot, that had
1 five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the
V boat: at the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the
large bottles in the case. which was almost empty, pour-
ing what was in it into another; and thus'furnished with
everything needful, we sailed out of the port to fish.>>

c
The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were, and took no notice of us ;,and we were not
above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail,
and set us down to fish. The wind blew from the north-
north-east, which was contrary to my desire; for had it
blown southerly, I, had been sure to have made the coast
of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but
my resolutions were, --blow which way it would,~ I would
be gone from that horrid place where _-I was, and leave
the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time, and catched nothing--
for when I had fish on my hook Lwould not pull them
up, that he might not see them--I said to the Moor,
" This will not do--our master will not be thus served--
we must stand farther 01f." He, thinking no harm,
agreed, and being in the head of the boat, set the sails ;
and as I had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league
farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish -; when,
giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the

' Moor was, and making as if I stooped for something be-

hind him, I took him by surprise with my arm under his
waist, and tossed him clear 'ovenboard into the sea: he
rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to
me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over
the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat,

', thathe would have reached me very quickly, there being

but little wind ; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him,
and told him, I_had done him no hurt, and if he would
be quiet I would do him none--" But," said I, f' you swim
well enough to reach to the shore, and the sea is calm--

>> make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you no

harm ;~ but if-Vyou come near the boat, I'll shoot you
through the head, for I am resolved'to have my liberty"
-~--so he turned himself about, and swam for the shore,
and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he

' was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with
me, and have drowned the boy, but there was no ventur-
ing to trust him. When he was gone, I turnedto the. ' EscAPEs m AN OPEN soar. .21

boy, whom they called Xury ury, and said tohim, "Xury, if
you will be faithful to me, I'll make you a great man ,
ut if you will not stroke your face to ybe true to me (that
. is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard), I must
" ' throw you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, '
and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him;
and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world -
withme.-. ,1}: ' '
5:: While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming g,
I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretch-
ing to windward, that they might thinkme gone towards
the Straits' mouth, as indeed any one that had been in
their wits must have been supposed to do; for who would
have supposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the
truly barbarian coast, where whole nations of negroes
were sure to surround us with their canoes, and destroy
us; where we could never once go on shore, but we should
"be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
of human kind?
In But as soon as it grew dusk inthe evening, I changed
my course, and steered directly south and by east, bend-
mg my course a little toward the east, that I might keep
__ ; in with the shore; and having a fair fresh gale of wind,
and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe,
by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I
first made the land, I could not be less than one hundred
and fifty miles south of Salee, quite beyond the Emperor
of Morocco' s dominions, or, indeed, of any other king
thereabouts, for we saw no peop p.1e
as Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and
the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their
hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore', or come to
an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in
that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the
' southward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were
in chase of me, they also would now give over; so Iven-
tured to make to the coast, and come to an anchorin the
, mouth of a little river, I knew not what or where--nei-
. ther what latitude, what country, what nation, nor what
. river \ I neither saw, nor desired to see, any people--the. -,,-.-n,.-,.-<<

fiprincipal thing I wanted was fresh water. 'We came into
;this creek 1n the evening, resolving to swim on shore as

soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but as soon
as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the
barking g, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we
knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die'
with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day
" Well, Xury," said I, " then I won't; but, it may be
we may see men by day ,whowill be as badto us as those
lions." " Then we give them the shoot gun,' 'says Xury,
laughing, " make them run way." Such English Xury
spoke by conversing among us slaves. However,Iwasglad
to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram, out of
our patron' s case of bottles, to cheer him up After all,
Xury' s advice was good, and I took it; we Pdrop ped our
little anchor, and lay still all night--I say still, for we
slept none--for m two or three hours we saw vast great

creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many sorts,

come down to the sea- shore, and run into the water,
wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of
cooling themselves; and they made such hideous howl-
ings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frig hted, and indeed so was I too ,
but we were both more fgrighted when we heard one of
these mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat.
We could not see him, but we might hear him by his
blowing,ato be a monstrous, huge, and furious beast;

Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I
, know. Poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor, and

row away." No," says I, " Xury, we can slip our cable

, with a buoy to it, and go to sea; they cannot follow us
. far. ", I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the crea<<
.ture whatever it was) within two oars' length, which
.somet g surprised me"; however, I immediately stepped

to the cabin door, and taking up pmy gun, fired at him,
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam to
the shore again.

But it was not possible to describe the horrible noises,
and hideous cries and howlings ,that Were raised, as well
upon the edge of the shore. as gflhigher within the country,eons mm IN sitiiton or warns. 28
upon the noise or mport of a gun--a thing I have some
reason to believe those creatures had never heard before
This convinced me that there was no going on shore for
us in the night upon that coast; and how to venture on
_;_ -shore' in the day, was another question too; for to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been as
bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and tigers ,
at least, we were equally apprehensive of the dan ger gof it
, 3r Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
'F. somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint left
-. in the boat; when or where to get it was the point. Xury
_' said if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars,
;' .he would find if there was any water, and bring some to
5 me. ,. I asked him why he would go '9. why I should not go,
;; and he stay' in the boat?~,a The boy answered with so
much affection, that made me love him ever after Says
1 he, " If wild mans come, they eat me, you go way "
1 "Well, Xury,"_ said I, "we will both g,o and if the wild
mans come, wewillkill them; they shall eat neitherof us. " <<
So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram
out of our patron' s case of bottles, which I mentioned
:7 before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as
f-j we thought was proper, and waded on shore, carrying

nothing but our arms, and two' Jars for water.

:~:- I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
. coming of canoes with savages down the river: but the
i _ boy y,eeeing a low place about a mile up the country, ram-
;"-_, bled to it; and by and by I saw him come running towards
L me. 'I thought he was pursued by some savage, or fiighted
with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards. him to
help him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw some-
'. thing hangin g6ver his 'shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but difierent in colour, and
longer legs. however, we were veryg glad of it, and it was
very g'egood meat; but the gr'eat Joy that poor Xury came
. with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen
" no wild mans. M? 2m. 21':

V. ' which flows but alittle way up; so we filled our jars and
feasted on the hare we had killed,-and prepared to go on

our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature

' in that part of the country..s 1 ' ,, '

As I had been one voyage to the coast before, I knew
very well that the islands. of the Canaries, and the Cape

de Verd islands also, lay not far ofi from the coast. But

as I had no instruments to take an observation to know

~. what latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or
at least not remember, what latitude they were in, and
knew not where to look for them, or when torstand ofi to sea
towards them : otherwise I might now easily have found
some of these islands. But my hope .was, that if I stood
along this coast till I Came to that part where the English
traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.
,1 By the best of my calculation, that place where I now
,was must be that country which, lying between the Em-
. perorof Morocco's dominions and the negroes, lies waste
._ and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes hav-

Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting,
by reason of its barrenness--and, indeed, both forsaking
. it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leo-
' pards, and other fluious creatures, which harbour there;
so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where
they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time--and, indeed,.for near an hundred miles together
upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited
country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and rear:-
ing of wild beasts by night. v . ', ' " , isms: "st?

hopes of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was
forced in again by 'contrary winds, the see. also going too
high for my little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first
design, and keep along the shore. ,
.. Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place; and'once, in particular, being early

t ' _, of land which was. pretty high ;. and the tide beginning
'. to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes
5 ' were more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly
_ ' to me, and tells me, that we had best go farther off the
E -- shore: "For," says he, "look--yonder lies a dreadful
monster, on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." Ilooked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it
was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore
under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung, as it were,

a little over him. " Xury," says I, " you shall go on shore

E! and kill him." Xury looked frighted, and said, " Mekilll

 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
  

however, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie still,
and I took our biggest gun, which was. almost musket-
bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with
two slugs, and laid it down ;. then I loaded another gun

---I loaded with five smaller bullets. Itook the best aim
I could with the first piece to have shot him into the head,
but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose,
' that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the
bone. He started up, growling at first, but finding his
leg broke, fell down again, and then got up upon three
legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard.
I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the
head ;' however, I took up the second piece immediately,
and, though he began to move off, fired again, and shot

and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. 'Then

"Well, go," said I {'so the boy jumped into the water,
and, taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shere with
' . the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
' ' muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into the head
' again, which despatched him quite. '

Jon board,'and asked me to give him the hatchet. ~" For
what, Xury?" said I. "Me out off his head," said he.

However, Xury could not cut ofl his head, but he cut ofl "

a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous
great one. '

.- I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of
him might, one way or other, he of some value to us;
and I resolved to take ofi' his skin if I could. So Xury
and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the
better'workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us both up the whole day, but at last we
got off the hide of him, and, spreading it on the top of
our cabin, the sun efi'ectually dried it in two days' time,
and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

 

CHAPTER III.

-Amna this stop, we made on to the southward continually
for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on. our pro-
, visions, which began to abate very much, and going no

oftener into the shore than we were obliged to do for fresh

water: my design in this was, to make the river Gambia '

or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European
ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to
take, but to seek for the islands,- or perish there'among
the negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which
sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazilpor to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands; and, in a
word, I put the whole of my fortune uponthis single point,

' either that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.
When I had" pursued this resolution'about ten days

longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land was '

inhabited; and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we
saw people stand upon the shoreto look at us: we could
also perceive they were quite black, and stark naked. I
was once inclined to go on shore to them; but Xury was
my better counsellor and said to me, "No go. no go."if: sauces sans ALONG r- snom. 27

, However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk
' to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a
' a good way: Iobserved they had no weapons in their hands
" except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury
: , said was a lance, and that they would throw them a great
'15- way with good aim ;. so I kept at a distance, but talked
with them by signs as well as I could, and particularly
made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me to
~ {. stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon
this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of
: them ran up into the country, and in less than half an
.; , ' hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry
,j. flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
f7 country; but we neither knew what the one nor the other
was; however, we were willing to accept it: But how to
come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for ven-
' turing on shore to them,' and they were as much afraid
'g' of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought
-_ " it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a
great way 011' till we fetched it on board, and then came
close to us again. - '
~ We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an opportunity offered that
5* ' very instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were
lying by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pur-
suing the other (as we took it with great fury from the ,
mountains. towards the sea: w ether it was the male pur-
suing the female, or whether they were in sport or in rage,
1-. we could not tell, any more than we could tell whether
1 it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter;
2-; because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures sel-
'j:. dom appear but in the night; and, in the second place, we
,5 i found the people terribly frighted, especially the women. "
The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them,
:-- but the rest did: however, as the two creatures ran
f; directly into the water, they did not seem to ofier to fall
' ' upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into the
sea, and swam about as if they had come for their divers
sion. -: At last one of them began to come nearer our
boat than at first I expected; but I lay ready for him,for I had loaded m ygunwith all possible expedition, and

bade Xury load boyth the others. As soon as he came'

fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly into
the head: immediately he sank down into the water, but
rose instantly, and plunged up and down as if he was
struggling for life, and so indeed he was: he immediately

made to the shore; but between the wound, which was ~

his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died
just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my y;gun some
of them were even ready to die for fear, and fell down

as dead with the very terror. But when they saw the .

~ creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made
signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart, and
.came to the shore, and beg an to search for the creature.
I found him by his blood sgtaining the water, and by the
help of a rope, which I slung round hin, and gave the
negroes .to haul, they dragg edg him on shore, and found
that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an
admirable degree, and the negr oes Pheld up their hands

with admiration to think what it was I had killed him

with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and

the noise of the gun, swam <<on shore, and ran up directly
to the mountains from whence they came, nor could I at

that distance know what it was. I found quickly the '

:.negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, so I
was Willing to have them take it as a favour fi'om me,
which when I made sign s to them that they might take
him, they were very thankful for. ' Immediately they fell
to work with him, and though they had no knife, yet,

' with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as

readily, and mfich'more readily, than we could have done

with a knife: They oifered me some of the flesh, which

I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made

signs for the skin, g.which they gave me very freely, and

brought me a great deal more of their provision, which,
though I did not understand, yet I accepted, then I made
signs to them for some water, and held out one of my<<If A em in SIGHT. ' ~ " 29

jars to them, urning it bottom upward, to show that it
was empty, and that I wanted to .have it filled. They

called'immediately to some of their friends, and there
came two women, and brought a great vessel made of
earth, and burned, as I suppose, in the sun; this they

with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were
as stark naked as the men.

5:- I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it
was, and water; and, leaving my friendly negroes, I made
-- forward for about eleven days more, without ofi'ering to
go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great

5.: leagues before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept
5. a large offing to make this point: at length, doubling the
point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly
- ' land on the other side to sea-ward ; then I concluded, as it

"' and those the islands, called from thence Cape de Verd

could not well tell what I had best to do; for, if I should

sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far
venoug h out of their reach. I Jump ped out of the cabin,
. and immediately saw, not only the ship, but what she
was, namely, that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea for negroes.
But when I observed the coast she steered, I was soon
if convinced they were bound some other way, and did not
design to come any nearer to the shore; upon which I
' stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to
speak with them if possible.

With all the sail IP could make, I found I should not be

with a sail! '3 and the foolish boy was frighted out of his '

\
' by before I could make any signal to them ;- but after I

had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they,
it seems, saw me by the help of their perspective glasses,
and that it was some European boat, which, as they sup-
posed, must belong to some ship that .was lost; so they
shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged
with this; and as I had my patron's ancient on board,
, I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and
fired a gun, both which they saw, for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon
these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for
me, and, in about three hours' time, I came up with them.
, They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of them:
but, at last, a Scots sailor, who was on board, called to
me, and I answered him, and told him I was an English-
man--that I had made my escape out of slavery from
_ the Moors at Sallee. They bade me come on board, and
very kindly took me in, and all my goods.
1 It was an inexpressible joy to me, as any one would
behave, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
such a miserable and almost hopeless condition as I was
in, and immediately offered all I had to the captain of the

ship, as a return for my deliverance ; but he generously.

told me he would take nothing from me, but that aflI had
should be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils.

, "For," says he, " I have saved your life on no other

A 3', terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may

5 i ' one time or other be' my lot to be taken up in the same

. ' condition: besides," said he, "when I carry you to the
. Brazils, so great away from your own country, if I should
take from you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life I have given, "No
no, Seignor Inglese," says be, "Mr Englishman, I will
carry you thither in charity, and those things will help
you to buy your subsistence there, and your passage
home-again." . '
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in
the performance to a tittle ; for he ordered the seamen,
that none should offer to touch anything Ihad: then he

them, even so much as my earthen Jars.

g; and told me he would buy it of me for the ship 's use,
I" and asked me what I would have for it ? I toldp him he
had been so generous in everything, that I could not
3 T ofi'er to make any yprice of the boat, but left it entirely to";
him, upon which he told me, he would give me a note of";
his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ,
7'? and when it came there, if any one offered to give more,
he would make it up :{ he offered me also sixty pieces of
eight more for my boy Xury; which I was loath to take:
;,. not that I was not willing to let the captain have him,
but I was very loath to segll the poor boy' s liberty, who
:w had assisted me so faithfullyinprocuringmy own How-
3' i: ever, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be
- {usyt, and offered me this medium, that he would give the
0 an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he
turned Christian.- Up on this, and Xury saying he was
.4 willing to gotohim, Iletthecap tainhavehim.

1-3 Weg had3 a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived
, in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay,in
about twenty-two days after. And now I was once more
delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life ,
and what to do next with my self I was now to consider.
' 3 The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can
never enough remember He would take nothing of me
,for my passage--gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and forty for the lion' s skin, which I hadin my boat,
. and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually
-:v delivered me; and what I was willing to sell he bought,
'-_ .. such as the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of
- '. the lump of bees' wax, for I had made candles of the rest
, g , ----in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieces
"x of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went" on

house of a good honest man like himself, who had an
ingeino,_ as they call it--that' 18: a plantation and a sugar-

 

'took every thing into his own possession, and gave me , --

33 As to my beat, it was averygood one, and that he saw, ~

' houses--I lived with him sometime, and acquainted my

self by thatmeans with the manner of their planting and
making of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived,
and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could
get license to settle there, I would turn planter among
them; resolving ,in the meantime, to findp out some way

. to get my money, which I had left' in London, remitted
'to me. To thisp purpose, getting a kind of a letter of
" naturalisation, I purchased as much land that was un-

cured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for

plantation and settlement, and such a one as might
bey suitable to the stock which I proposed to myselfg to
receive from _Eng land. -

I had a ne 1ghbour, a Portuguese of 'Lisbon, but born
of English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much
such circumstances as I was. I call him neighbour, be-
cause his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on
very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well
as his; and we rather planted for food, than anything
else, for about two years.- However, we began to increase,

' and our land began to come into order; so that the third

year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a

large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year

to come; but we both wanted help: and now I found,

_ 'more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my

boy Xury
Butury alas! for me to do wrong, that never didng

"Ewes no great wonder. I had no remedy but to go Iigm;
. --I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my

genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in,

i v and for which I forsook my father' 3 house, and broke

through all his good advice--nay, Iwas coming into the
very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which my

father advised me to before; and which, if I resolved to go
on with, I might as well have staid at home, and never
have fatigued myself in the world as I had done; and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well
in England among my friends, as have gone five thou-
sand miles ofi' to do it among strangers and savages in
a wilderness and at such distance, as never to hear-
from any part of the world that had the least knowledge
of me. "-1.131; m- '<<;.-,-r;i;;
,_ _ In this manner I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but
1 now and then this nei ghbour--no work to be done but by
1 L the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I livedj ust like
a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had
.3 nobody there but himself. But how just has it been, and
.; how should all men reflect, that, when they compare their
9. present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven
; may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced
e of their fgormer felicity, by their experience--I say, how
-- just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on
:5. in an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had
so often unjustly compared it with the lifey which I then
.,'led in which, had I continued, I had, in all probability,
_ been exceeding prosperous and rich." , : ,-
,3 <<1 I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for. carry-
ing on the plantation, beforemy kind friend, the captain
, of gthe ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the
1. ship remained there, in providing his loading, and pre-
:, gfor his voyage, near three months, when, telling
, filing what little stock I had left behind me in London, he
_; gave me this friendly and sincere advice: " Seignor
,_. Inglese'," says he, for so he always called me, " if you will
give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me,
with orders to the person who has your money in Lon-
don, to send your efi'ects to Lisbon, to such persons as I
. shall direct, and .m such goods as are proper for this J '
' I_.; country, I will bring you the produce of them, God will
2 ing, at my return; but, since human afiairs are all sub-
7 :ject to changes and disasters, I would have you give
, _orders but for one hundred pounds sterling which, you
{, <<say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the
I" first; so that, if it come safe,- you may order the rest the
7" ; same way, and if it miscarry, you may have the other
'1': half to have recourse to for your supp y." .
:is- .This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly,
.-_' that I could not but be convinced it was the best course
V I could take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the, .gentlewoman with whom .I had left my money, and a _
procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.

I wrote the English captain' s widow a full account of
all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and h9w I had
met with the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of
his behaviour, and what condition I was now in, with
all other necessary directions for my supply; and when
this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by ,
'some of the English merchants there, to send over, not ,
- the order only, but a full account of my story, to a mer-
chant at London, who represented it efiectually to her;
whereupon, she not only delivered the money, but, out
' of her own pocket, sent the Portugal captain a very hand-

' some present for his humanity agnd charity to me.

The merchant' in London vestingthis hundred pounds
in English goods, such as the captain had writ for, sent '
them directly to him at Lisbbn, and he brought them all
' safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without my
direction for I was too young in my business to think
' of them), e had taken care to have all sort of tools,
iron-work, and utensils, necessary for my plantation, and
which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made,
for I was surprised with Joy of it; and my good steward,
the captain, had laid out the five pounds which my friend
had sent him for a present for himself, to purchase, and
{ bring me over a servant under bond for six years' service,

: and would not accept of any consideration, except a little
tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my
own p.roduce ,.

Neither was this all; but my goods being all English

' manufactures, such as cloth, ystgufis, baize; and thgings
particularly valuable and desirable inthe country, Ifound
means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that I ,1
may say I had more than four times the value of my first
cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour,
I mean in the advancement of my plantation; for the
first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and an
Europeang servant also--I mean another besides that";

which the captain brought me from Lisbon. - " '~: 7

the reflections upon my self, which' in my future sorrows
I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriages

To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this
part of my story: you may suppose, that, having now.
-lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginnm ginninito '
thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I ad36 ' 1.1m AND AnvnNrunssor ROBINSON causos,

,3; :'not onlyleamt the language, but had contracted acquain-
w , tance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as
among the merchants at St Salvadore, which was our
port; and that in myvdiscourse among them, I had fre-'

quently given them an account of my two voyages to the, f

>> coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast,
fortrifles--such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets,
bits of glass, and the like--not only gold dust, Guinea
grains, elephants' teeth, &c;, but negroes for the service
of the Brazils in great numberSs

They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related
to buying negroes', which was a trade at that time not
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been

carried on by the bssientos, or permission, of the kings of J

Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public, ,so that
'few negroes were bought, and those excessivelydear.

' ' It happened, being in company with some merchants v .:

and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those

things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next _

.v morning, and told me they had been musing Vary much '1
upon what I had discoursed with them of the last night, '
and they came to make a secret proposal to me; and,

"after enjoining me secrecy, they told me, that they had a
mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all -

. plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing .er
so much as servants ;, that as it was a trade that could
not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell

-' the negroes when they came home, so they desired to
make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their own plantations ;, 'V;
and, in a' word, the question was, whether I would go . '

their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
'upon the coast of Guinea ? and they offered me, that I _

should have my equal share of the negroes, without pro-
' viding any part of the stock. -'
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it -

been made to any one that had not had a settlement and,

' plantation of his a' 4m to look after, which was in a fair,gv}.

, way of coming to be very considerable, and with a good
V' stock up 'on it;:- But for me, that was thus enteredg and
{a established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had
begun ,for three or four years more, and tgo have sent for

the other hundred pounds from Eng land, and who,in .
'- that time and with that little addition, could scarce have
~ failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds ster-
ling, and that moreasing too--for me to think of sucha
T' voyage, was the most preposterous thing that ever man
' in such circumstances could be guilty of.
, 7m But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no ,
V . more resist the offer than I could restrain my first ramb-
E ling designs, when my father' s good counsel was lost upon
me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart
if they would undertake to look aftegr my plantation 1n
1" my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should
direct, if I miscarried This they all engaged to do, and ' i
'_ entered into writings, or covenants, to dogag so; and I made '.=
.>> a formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects in

' case of my death, making the captain of the ship that
7- had savedy my life as before, my unigersal heir, butp oblig-
f ing him to diysp ose of my effects as I had directed' in my
_ , will, one half of the produce being to himself, and the
'5: other to be shipped to Eng land.
a In short, I took all'possible caution to preserve my
effects, and keep up my plantation, had I used half as
, much prudence to have looked into my own interest, and '
2' have made a jgmud ent of what I ought to have done, and
' ' not to have dJonegm, I had certamly never gone away from

, 7; views 01' a thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage -
to sea, attended with all its common hazards; to say
nothing of the reasons Iliad to expect particular misfor- '
s , tunes to myself .:
j ;'V. But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates
.7 of m yfancy, rather than my reason. and, accordingly, the
_-I ship ybeing fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all
2: things done as by agreement by my partners in the voyage,
a; I went on board in an evil hour again, the 1st of Sep tem-
ber 1659, being the same day eight years that I Went Pfrom38 ~ Lira lam-1 nmNruans or nosleoiN onuson.

'--. Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons
burden, carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides the
master, his boy, and myself; we had on board no large

- cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our
- trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells,
and' odd. trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives,
scissors, hatchets, and the like. .

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing
<<away to the northward upon our own coast, with design
to stretch over for the African coast, when they came about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,

very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way upen
our own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St
Augustino, from whence, keeping farther 011' at sea, we
lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the
isle Fernand de Noronha, holding our course north-east
, by north, and leaving those isles on the east. In this
course we passed the Line in about twelve days' time, and
were, by our last observation, iii seven degrees, twenty-
two minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or
hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge: it began
from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and
then settled into the north-east; from whence it blew in
_ ' such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we
, could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before'it,
' , let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of the winds
- directed; and during those twelve days, I need not say
' that I expected every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed,
did any in the ship expect to save their lives.
5:9 In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men dead of the calenture, and one man and
' the boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the
weather abating a little, the master made an observation
Jas Well as he could, and found that he was in about twenty-
,two degrees of longitude difi'erence west from Cape St
, Augustino; so that he found he was gotten upon the coast

I was positively against that: and, looking over the

therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes, which,
" , by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay or
,3, gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hop ed, in
_ j, about fifteen days' sail: whereas we could not possibly

make our voyage to the coast of Africa, without some

assistance, both to our ship and ourselves.- ram"?- _-- , >> ,
I 5am With this design we changed our course, and steered
away north-west by west, in order to reach some of our
f- English islands, where I hop ed for relief: but our voyage
. , was otherwise determined;= 1)for, being 1n the latitude of
twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came
71'- upon us, which carried us away with the same impetu-

,' , osity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all
human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as to
if, the sea, we were rather: in danger of being devoured by
' savages than ever returning to our own country. .

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one
of our men,e eyarl in the morning, cried out " Landl "
2-19: and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in
i; hopes of seeing whereabouts m the world we were, but
1. the ship struck upon a sand, and, in a moment, her mo:
' tion being so stopped, the sea broke over her m such a
- " , manner that we expected we should all have perished 1m-
mediately, and we were immediately driven into our close
quarters, to shelter us fiom the very foam and spray of

3 the sea. 53:: llfieiliti (2.11:: ,

_ ' s It 18 not easy for any one, who has not been in the
: like condition, to describe or conceive the consternation

-_ , of men in such circumstances: we knew nothing where

E we were, or upon what land it was we were driven----

 

whether an island or the main, wnether inhabited or not .
inhabited; and as the ra ge of the wind was still great,
thong h rather less than at g,first we could not so much as
J hopeg to have the ship hold many minutes without break-
: ' ling 1n pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle,
should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat look.
. ing one upon another, and expecting death every moment,
and every man acting accordingly, as preparing for an-
other world; for there was little or nothing more for us
to do 1n this: that which was our present comfort, and
all the comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our ex-
~pectat1on, the ship did not break y,et and that the mas-
ter said the wind beg an to abate. '
Now, though we gthou ght that the wind did a little
abate, yet, the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off, we
were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to
do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could.
We had a boat at our stern just before the storm; but
she was first staved by dashing against the ship's rudder,
and, in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk
or was driven oil to sea; so there was no hope from her.
. We had another boat on board, but how to get her ofi
into the sea was a doubtful thing ,however, there was no
room to debate, for we fanciedg the ship would break 1n
pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already.
' ' In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the
-- boat, and, with the help of the rest of the men, they got
her slung over the ship' s side, and getting all into her,
let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven 1n number,
' to God's mercy and the wild sea; for thong h the storm
was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfull yhigh
upon the shore, and might well be called den wild zeo,as
the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all
saw plainly, that the sea went so high that the boat could
not live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As,
to making sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could we
have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar to-
wards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going

well, yet I could not deliver my self from the waves so as

water, if I could; and so, by yswimming, to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible
--my greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it

,would carry me a great way towards the shore when it
came on, might not carry me back again with it when it
gave back towards the. sea.

.The wave that came upon me again, buried me at. once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body; and I could
feel myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness to-

:wards the shore a very great way ;' but I held my breath,

and- assisted myself to swim still forward with all my

might" .I was ready to burst with holding my breath,

when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate

,relief, I found. my head and hands shoot out above the
' surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds

of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath, and new courage. I was covered
again with water a good while, but not so long, but I
held it out; and, finding the water had spent itself, and
began to return, I struck forward against the return of
the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the water
went from me, and then took to my heels, and run with
what strength I had farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver ma hen the fury of the sea,

.'which came pouring in after me again; and twice more

I was lifted up by the waves, and carried forwards as

- before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of those two had Well near been fatal to

. me; for the sea, having hurried me along as before, landed .

me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and
that with such force as it left me senseless, and indeed
helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow taking
my side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out
ofy my body, and had it returned again immediately, I
must yyhave been strangled in the water; but I recovered
a little before the return of the waves, and, seeing I
should be covered again with the water, I resolved3 to
hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath,
if possible, t'ill thawave went back. Now, as the waves.393; DRIVEN ssnoau oN m MAINLAND. , 43

were not so high as at first, being near land, I held my
. hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
', which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
. though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as
to carry me away , and the next run I took I got to the
' mainland, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the
[,- clifl's of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free
'1 from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.

w I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look
up and thank God that _my life was saved, in a case

:' tion of my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and V

<<2 I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach
,,-' and froth of the sea being so big g, I could hardly see it,
;. it lay so far off, and considered, Lord! how was yit pos-
' sible I could get on shore?

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part

of my condition, I beg an to look round me, to see what
kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done;

; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,
I had a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no
' '- clothes to shift me nor; . anything either to eat or drink
to comfort 'me'; neither' did I see any prospect before me . 3%.
but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts; and that which was particularly afliicting j
to me was, that I had no weapon eitherto hunt and kill
' any creature for my sustenance, or to. defend myself
against any other 'creature that might desire to kill me
\ for theirs--in a word, I had nothing about me but a knife,
- a tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box;-this was
' all my provision, and this threw me into terrible agonies
of mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman.
Night coming upon me, I began, 'with a heavy heart, to
consider what would be my lot if there were any raven-
ous beasts in that country, seeing at night they always
come abroad for their prey. .
~ All the remedy that ofl'ered to my thoughts at that time
p was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but
thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit
all night, and consider the next day what death I should
.die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. .I walked about
a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh
water to drink, which I did, to my great joy; and having
drunk, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent
hunger, I went, to the tree, and getting up into it, en-
deavoured to place myself so as that if I should sleep I
might not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a

= CHAPTER Iv.

WHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and
| the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell
3.: as before; but that which surprised me most was, that
if the ship waslifted off in the night from the sand where 'f
it she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and Was driven up '

1 almost as far as the rock which I first mentioned, where
3.>> I had been so bruisedby the dashing me against it; this "
, being within abouta mile from theg shore where I was,
'3 and the ship pseeming to stand up right still, Iwished my-
., self on board, that, at least, I might save some neces-
-- sary things for my use '

- <<' When I came down from my apartment m the tree,
- I looked about me again, and the first thing I found was
r the boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had tossed
: her up upon the land, about two miles on my right

:" me and the boat, which was about half a mile broad: so
_QI came back for the present, being more intent upon
{ getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for '
. my present subsistence.-; .1- <<---<< .i'g :<<r\- 3.4; 5;. g; It": ,,

. ' A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the
f tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the ship; and hereIfound a fresh renew-
'-' ing of my grief: for I saw evidently, that if we had kept
; on board, we had been all safe--that is to say, we had
9 all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable '
v as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company,
<3 as I now was.- This forced tears from my eyes again;
I" but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible,
:_to get to the ship--so I pulled 011' my clothes? for the
3 Weather was hot to extremity, and took the water. But
i when I came to the ship p,my difiiculty was still greater
to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground and
high out of the water, there was nothing withinmy reach
to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and they second
" time I spied a small piece of a rope, which Iwondered I
did not see at first, hang downby the fore- chains, so low
as that with great difiicgulty I got hold of it, and, by the
help of that rope, got up into the forecastle of the ship.

. Here I found that the ship was bul g,ed and had a great ,
' ',- deal of water' m her hold, but that she lay so on the side
E'of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, yand her stern
a lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head, low almost to
the water: by this means all her quarter was free, and all46 . mu AND summons or nosmsofi causes.

that was in that part was dry'; for you maybe sure my
first Work was to search and to see what was spoiled,
. and what was'free :' and first I found that all the ship's
provisions were dry and untouched by the water; and
being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room,
and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went
about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also
found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a
large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to
spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted noth-
ing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which
I foresaw would be very necessary to me. '

' It' was in, vain to sit still and wish for what was not
to be had; and this extremity roused my application.
We had several spare yards, and two or three large spars
of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I~~re--
solved to fall to work with these, and flung as_many of
them overboard as I could manage of their weight, tying
every One with a rope, that they might not drive away.
When this was done, I went down to the ship's side, and
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together at
_ both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and
laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them cross-
' ways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great Weight, the pieces being
too light;' so I.Went to work, and, with the carpenter's
~ saw, I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added

' ' them to my raft, with a great deal of'labour and<<pains ;

but hope of furnishing myself withnecessaries, encour-
aged me to go beyond what I should have been able to
. have done upon another occasion;

 
   

5 My raft Was now strong enough to bear any reasonable ~ L}

- weight ;' my next care was what to load it with, and how
to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea ,'
but I was not long considering this. I first laid all the

planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having

considered well what I most wanted, I first got three of
' the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and emptied,

' and lowered them down upon my raft. The first of these ' I

7. to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had
, been some barley and wheat together, but, to my great
;_ disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
. -' eaten or spoiled it all. . .As for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belcngin gmg to our skipper, in which were
'_ some cordial waters, and, in all, above five or six gallons

to put them into the chest, nor no room for them While

: and it was after long searching that I found out the car-
penter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to
I me, and much more valuable than a ship load of gold
' would have been at that time. I got it down to my raft,

; even whole as it was, without losing time to look into it,

" for I knew in general what it contained. '-

: 11 My next care was for some ammunition>> and arms.
" .2. There were two very good fowling- pieces in the great cabin,
" and two pistols: these I seemed first, with some powder-

little wind there was blew me toward the land: and thus,

having found two or three broken oars belonging to the

boat, Oand, besides the tools which were in the chest, 1
found- two saws, an axe, and a hammer; and. with this
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft

went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant '

from the place where I had landed before; by which I
perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and,
consequently, I hop ed to find some creek or river there,

my cargo. .

As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a
little opening of the land, and I found a strong current
of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as well asI
could to keep in the middle of the stream, but here I had
like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had,
I think verily would have broke my heart; for, knowing
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at 'one end of
it upon a shoal, and, not being aground at the other end,

it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off "

towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the
'.hwater I did my utmost, by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, buyt could not thrust
off the raft with all my strength , neither durst I stir from
the posture I was in, but, holding' gup the chests with all

7' my might,- stood in that manner near half an hour, in

up the river,- hoping, in time, to see Some ship at sea.

as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the

' 4' had like to have dipped all my cargo in the sea again;
; f 7. for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping,
', ' there was no place to land, but where one end of the
5' float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other

, V - " ,Where I was, I yet knew not ;' whether on the continent
1 ' or on an island--whether inhabited or not inhabited--

hill, not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
'_ , and high, and which seemed to. overtop some other hills
' ' _ which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took - out
one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a

what not. At my ycoming back, I shot at a great bird,
which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great
wood: I believe it was the firstgun that had been fired
there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
fired, but, from all parts of the wood, there arose an in-
numerable number of fowls of many sorts, making a con-
fused screaming and crying, every one according to his
usual note, but not one of them of any kind thath knew.
As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had no talons,

fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and fell to work to bring my ycargo on shore, which took
me up the rest of that day: and what to do with myself
at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest; for Iy was
afraid to lie down on the gr,ound not knowing but some
wild beast might devourgr me;- though, as I afterwards
found,,there was really no need for those fears."

However, as well as Icould, I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore,
and made a kind of a but for that night's lodging. As for
food,"I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except
that I had seen two or three creatures like hares run out
of the wood where I shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great
many things out of the ship, which would be useful to
me", and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and
such other things as might come to land, and I resolved
to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible;
and as I knew that the first storm that blew must neces-
sarily break her all in pieces; I resolved to set all other
things apart;~till I got everything out of the ship that I
could get Then I called a council (that 18 to say in my
thoughts), whether I should take back the raft; but this
appeared impracticable; so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down, and I did so, only that I strip-

5' I got on board the ship ' 2} before, and prepared a second
raft; and having had experience of the first, I neither
made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I
i _'--' brought away several things very useful to me; as first,
1; ~: ,' in" the carpenter' s stores, I found two or three bags full
if _' .,~ ,, of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, 'a dozen or two of

{i

J ', ', - hatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a
' '- grindstone: all these I secured together with several
'. things belonging to the gunner,p particularly two or three
,: 'f .j. iron crows, and two barrels of musket- bullets, seven
:11 _ - muskets, and another fowling- -piece, with some small
-'3 , quantity of powder more; a large bag full of small shot,
3:. _. , and a great roll of sheet lead, but this last was so heavy
,l I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's sidesv .
:1 J- Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that
,7. " V I could find, and a spare foretop-sail, hammock, and some
;'1. ' bedding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and
' brought them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.
' I ., L' I was under some apprehensions during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be de-
voured on shore; but, when I came back, I found no sign
- t 'of any visitor, only there sat a creature, like a wild cat,
- ~ upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it,
_. ran away a little distance, and then stood still: she sat
~ very composed and unconcerned, and looked full in my
4. face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I
a; presented my gun at her, but as she did not understand
it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she ofi'er
It 1' I" to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit,
, _ though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store

g f ' - she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked, as
'3, ,- ' ' pleased, for more; 'but Ithanked her, and could spare no
1,-45 more--so she marched ofi. ,
. ' .3 Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was
. fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by
-parce1s--for they were too heavy, being large casks--I
Went to work to make' me a little tent, with the sail and
1 _j' some poles which I cut for that purpose, .. and into this
J tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil either
- .
with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty chests and
casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest set up
on end without, and, spreading one of the beds upon the
ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my
gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and
slept very quietly all night, for I was very weary and
heavy; as the night before I had slept little, and had
laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all those things
from the ship as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever
was laid up, I behave, for one man, but I was not satisfied
still; for, while the ship sat upright in that posture, I
thought I ought to get everything out of her that I could :
so every day, at low water, I went on' board, and brought
away something or other ; but particularly the third time
I went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could,
as also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvass, which was to mend the-
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder;
in a word, I brought away all the sails first and last,
only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as -
much at a time as I could; for they were no more useful '

60 be sails, but as mere canvass only. ,
But that which comforted me more still, was, that last

70f all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these,

and thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship
that was worth my meddling with--I say, after all this,
I found a great hogshead of bread, and three large runlets
of mm or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine
flour ; this was surprising to me, because I had given over
expecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled .1
by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, ' ' '
and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails,
which I cut out: and, in a word,'I got all this safe on
shore also. _ ~ -

and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could

" 1', get; and having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the

mizen-yard, and everything I could, 'to make alarge raft,

I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came away:
' .p but my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft

was so unwieldy and overladen, that, after I had entered
. ' >> the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods,
>>' not being able to guide it so handily as I did the others,

it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water.

As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the

shore; but as to my cargo, it was, great part of it, lost,

' i >;' especially the iron, which I expected would have been of

great use to me :" however, when the tide was out, I got

most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron ,v
1-; though with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it
' 2 ~ into the water, a work which fatigued me'very much.

water, I went on board, and though I thought I had

,-' could be found, yet I discovered a' locker with drawers in
, - -' -. .it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and one

go to the bottoin as a creature whose life is not worth
saving." However, upon second thoughts, I took it away,
and, wrapping gall this 111 a piece of canvass, I began to
think of making another raft; but, while I was preparing
this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind beg an to rise,
and m quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the
shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to
pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and- that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood

began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore '

at all: accordingly, I let my self down into the water, and
swam across the channel which lay between the ship and
the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly
with the weight of things I had about me, and partly the
roughness of the water, for the wind rose very hastily, and,
before it was quite high wa',te1 it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay
with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very
hard all that night, and in the morning when I looked
out, behold no more ship was to be seen I I was a little
surprised, but recovered myself with this satisfactory re-
flection, namely, that I had lost no time; nor abated no
diligence, to get everything out of her that could be useful
to me, and that indeed. there was little left in her that l

1was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of
anything'out of her, except what might drive on shore
fromthe wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards
did M but those things were, of small use to me.

Mythofights were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or
wild beasts, if any were on the island, and I had many
thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of
dwelling to make--whether I should make me a cave in
the earth, or a tent upon the earth: and, in short, I re-
solved upon both, the manner and description of which
it may not be improper to give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settle-
ment, particularly because it was upon a low moorish
ground near the sea, and I believe would not be whole-

. 3, more convenient spot of ground; ~
- . "- 'r' I consulted several things in my situation which Ifound
' would be proper for me :----1st, Health and fresh water I

- - ship in sight, 1' might not lose any advantage for my
deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my
'- expectation yet.:eSSusiequgmm- ;
" "2' In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain
' - ' '. on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little
' ' - plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come
' ' down upon me from the top: on the side of this rock there
., was a hollow place worn a little way in, like the entrance
' ..; 5 or door of a cave, but there was not really any cave or
'~ ' way into the rock at all.s;r ~.: .. .
.. On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place,
, 1 I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was not above an
' ~' hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay
' like a green before my door, and at the end of it descended
3 irregularly every way down into the low grounds by the
- . - , sea-side. _ .It was on the north-north-west side of the hill,
I so that I was sheltered from the heat every day, till it
.3 came to a west-and-by-soutlf sun, or thereabouts, which
. f in those countries is near the setting.
7' ' . h - i'h- Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the
i} ' '_ _. ' hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi:
' a diameter from the rock, and twenty yards inits diameter,
F' " 's_ ' '1 from its beginning and ending. .

post; and this fence was so strong that neither man nor
beast could get into it, or over it: this cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the '
woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into
the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a
door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top; which
ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me: and' so I
was completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought,
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the
night, which otherwise I could not have done; though
as it appeared afterward, there was no need of all this
caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried
an .my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores,
of which you have the account above; and I made me a
large tent, which, to preserve me from the rains, that in
one part of the year are very violent there, I made double,
namely, one smaller tent within, and one larger tent
above it, and covered the uppermost with a large tar-
paulin, which I had saved among the sails.

_ And now I lay no more, for a while, in the bed which
I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was,
ifieed, a "very good one, and belonged to the mate of the
s p. ' -

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every-
thing that would spoil by the wet ;- and having thus en-
closed all my goods, .I made up the entrance, which, till
now, I had.left open, and so passed and repassed, as I
said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into
. the rock, and, bringing all the earth and stones that I
dug down, out through my tent, I laid them up within
my fence in the nature of a terrace, that so it raised the:
ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made
me a cave just behind my tent, which served me like a
cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour and many days before all
theSe things were brought to perfection; and, therefore,DISCOVERB' soars ON m iQLAND. 57

, I must go back to some other things which took up some
of my thoughts. At the same time, it happened, after I
I" had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and mak-
" ing the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark
'7: cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, .and after
ii _- that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the efiect of it.
I was not so much surprised with the lightning as I was
;., av with a thought which darted into my mind, as swift as
._ ' L." the lightning itself: Oh, my powder! my very heart sank
' __,_.< within me, when I thought that, at one blast, all my pow-
;3 der might be destroyed, on which, not my defence only,
.1 but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depend~
'5' ~1- 3 ed :7, I was nothing near so anxious about my own dan-
"' ger, though, had the powder took fire, I had never known
who had hurt me. ~ '

'33 '9 Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
,3 storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building
. ' and fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes,
5, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little
in a'parcel, in hope that, whatever might come, it might
not all take fire at once, and to keep it so apart, that it
3 . 'i. should not be possible to make one part fire another., I
. finished this work in about a fortnight; and I think my
. 1; powder, which, in all, was about two hundred and forty
:2 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred
. parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not
*' apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in my
g, ,5 new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen; and
. the rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks,
f: so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully

.< where I laid it.
'9' In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
' out once at least every day with my gun, as well to divert
" myself as to see if I could kill anything fit for food, and,
as near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the
island produced. The first time I went out, I presently
discovered that there were goats in the island, which was
i ' a great satisfaction to me; but then, it was attended with
L this misfortune to me, namely, that they were so'shy, so
subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most difficult

 

a, min-"Lawlawsewmwa
thing in the world to come at them. But I was not dis-
couraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then
shoot one, as it soon happened; for, after I had found
their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them.
I observed, if they saw me in the valleys, though they were
upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence
I concluded, that, by the position of their'optics, their
sight was so directed downward, that they did not readily
see objects that were above them: so afterwards I took
this method: I always climbed the rocks first, to get
above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. The
- first. shot I made among these creatures I killed a she-

goat, which had a little kid by her which she gave suck to, -

which grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the
kid stood stock still by her till I came and took her up;
and not only so, but, when I carried the old one with me
upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my en-
closure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the
kid in my arms, and carried it.over my pale, in hopes to
have bred it up tame; but it would not eat, so I was
forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied
me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved
any picavisions (my bread especially) as much as possibly

co . ,

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to
burn; and what I did that for, as also how I enlarged my
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full
account of in its place; but I must first give some little
account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which,
it may well be supposed, were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for, as I was
not cast away upon that island without being driven, as
is said, by a violent storm, quite out of the course of our
intended voyage, and a great way, namely, some hundreds
of leagues, 'out of the ordinary course of the trade 01
mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determin-
ation of Heaven, that, in this desolate place, and in this

4;:.>> ' summations s! was SEA-SIDE. 59
. *5 g: desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would

 

" if- run plentiftu down my face when I made these reflec-
-- , tions; and sometimesIwouldexpostulatewithmyselfwhy
' . Providence should thus completely ruin his creatures,
and render them so absolutely miserable, so without help
abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be
rational to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and, particularly, one
. r, _ day walking, with my gun in my hand, by the sea-side, I
f, a, - was very pensive u on the subject of my present condi-
fl"; tion, when reason, sit were, expostulated with me the
' a other way, thus :--" Well, you are in a desolate condition,
' if J it is true; but pray, remember, Where are the rest of ygu ?
'1' >> 1 Did not you come eleven of you into the boat ? Where
" 7 .-. are the ten ? Why were they not saved and you lost 9" Why
.- were you singled out? Is it better to be here or there ?"
> 1 '- And then I pointed to the sea. All evils are tobe con.
sidered with the good that is in them, and with what
' -. .91; " worse attended them. . .
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished
'1 for my subsistence, and what would have been my case
1,": if it had not happened, which was an hundred thousand
' , to one, that the ship floated fiom the place where she first
struck, and was driven so near the shore that I had time
' C to get all things out of her. What would have been my
case, if I had been to have lived in the condition in which
' I at first came on shore, without necessaries of life, or
. necessaries to supply or procure them ? " Particularly,"
- said I, loud, though to myself, "what should I have
. , . done without a gun, without ammunition, without any
T4 tools to make anything, or to work with--without clothes,
bedding, a tent or any manner of covering ?" and that
_ '-_ now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and was in
i . , a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live
' without my gun when my ammunition was spent; so that
" _} "7'" I had a tolerable view of subsisting without any want, as
f long as I lived: for I considered, from the beginning, how
" I should provide for the accidents that might happen,
. and for the time that was to come, even not only after

my ammunition should be spent, but even after myhealth
and strength should decay.

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean, my
powder being blown up by lightning; and this made the
thoughts of it so surprising to me when it lightened and
thundered, as I observed just now.

And now, being about to enter into a melancholy re-
lation of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never
heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its
beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my
account, the 80th of September, when, in the manner as
above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island, when
thevsun being, to us, in its autumnal equinox, was almost
just over my head; for I reckoned myself, by observation,
to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty two minutes,
north of the Line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts, that I should lose my reckoning of time
for want of books, and pen and ink, and should even for-
get the Sabbath days from theworking days ; but, to pre-
vent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post a capital
letters, and making it'into a great cross, I set it up on the
shore where I first landed, namely, I came on shore here
on the 80th of September 1659. Upon the sides of this
square post, I out every day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and
every first day of the month as long again as that long
one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly,
.and yearly, reckoning of time.

In the next place, we are to observe, that, among the
many things which I brought out of the ship in the several
voyages, which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got
several things of less value, but not at all less useful to
me, which I omitted setting down before ;. as, inparticular,
pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain's,
mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three or four
compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, per-
pectives, charts, and books of navigation, all which I
huddled together, whetherI might want them or no. Also,

1', . .. $09315 2022:,me or roars. 61
i '7'; : Ifound three very good Bibles, which came to me inmy
"' ;SS; cargo from England, and which I had packed up among
'-'< Z . my things; some Portuguese books also, and amongthem
a ; two orthree Popish prayer-books, and several otherbooks:
all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget
' that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose
. f 7">> eminent history I may have occasion to say something
- in its place ;, for I can-ied both the cats, with me :- and as
' '1. z for the dog, he jumped out of theship of himself, and
g :1 :7 7f. swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with
1 ' my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many
' '7 a .3 "- years: I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any
1 company that he could make up to me--I only wanted
51442; to have him talk to me ;' but that he could not do. <<As I
' 1;; 3 observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and Ihus-
|~ .. - handed them to the utmost; and I shall show, that while
' ~ g , ' ' 3 my ink lasted, Ikept things very exact ; but after that was
_ g :1, gone I could not, for I could not make any ink by any
'; '_ f, means that I could devise. '
' , , ",- And this put mein mind that I wanted many things,
A .; notwithstanding all that, I had amassed together; and of
_ .- .31 ; these, this of ink 'was one, as also spade, pick-axe, and
7? 5'1 ; shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and
if: ' ._ 3 thread. i As for linen, I soon learnt to want that without
{21.3" much didicultyn , >>
:_- . This want of tools made every work I did go on heavi-
', " { ly, and it was near a whole year before I had entirely fin-
V', I <<1 ished my little pale, er surrounded habitation: the piles,
, J or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were
- ,1- a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and
._'. more by far in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes
~ I two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts,
; ;_i: g and a third day in driving it into the ground; for which
3, A" ., purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last
3" i .- bethought myself of one of the iron crows, which, how-
" ever, though I found it, yet it made driving those posts,
" or piles, very laborious and tedious work.
3; But what need I have been concerned at the tedious-
? ness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough
' f, to do it in ?. Nor had Ianv other employment, if that
had'beeii 'over, at least'that I could foresee, except the
rangingpthe island to' seek for food, which I did more or
less everyday. '

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and
the circumstances I Was reduced to, and I drew up .the
state of my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them
to any that were to come after me (forI was like to have
but few heirs , as to deliver my thoughts from daily
poring upon t em, and afiiicting my mind; and as my
reason began now to master my despondency, I began to
comfort'myself as well as I could, and to setwthe good
against the evil, that I might have something" to distin-
guish my case from worse ; and stated it very impartially,
fikSSdebtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against
themiseries I suffered, thus :--

But I'am alive, and not drown-

But I am singled out, too, from

all the Ship's crew, to be spared -

from death; and He that miracu-
lously saved me from death, can

' deliver me from this condition.

But I am not starved and per:

But I am in a hot climate,
where, if I had clothes, I could
hardly wear them.

But I am cast on an island,
where I see no wild beasts to hurt
me, as I'saw on the coast of Af-
rica; and what if Ihad been ship-
wrecked there ? _

But God wonderfully sent the
ship in near enough to the shore,
that I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will either sup-
ply my wants, or enable me to sup-
ply myself, even as long as I live.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable,
but there was something negative or something positive<<a

1-: .4 in this world, that we may always find in it something
~ ;, -=1to comfort ourselves from, and to set in the description of

{ f '3, 314' Having now brought my mind a little to relish my con-

-'C/ ' =apply myself to accommodate my way of living, and to

1'- <<tu- I have' already described my habitation, which was a
. 7* 1' tent, undeIITthe side of a rock, surrounded with a strong
p. "pale of posts and cables ;' but I might now rather call it
- 1. a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs,

3: , ., *into the earth ; for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded
' 1 . 'easily to the labour Ibestowed on it--and so, when Ifound
' f I was pretty, safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways
,3 'i to the right hand into the rock: and then, turning to the
' 5 right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to

thematics, so, by stating and squaring everything by rea-

had never handled a tool in my life, and yet in time, by

7 labour, application, and contnvance, Ifound at last that

I wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if
I had had tools; however, I made abundance of things
even without tools, and some with~no more tools than an
adzeand a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that
way before, and that with infinite labour--for example,
if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a
tree, set it on an edge before me, and how it flat on either
side with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true,
by this method I could make but one board out of a whole
tree ; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more
than Ihad for the prodigious deal of time and labour which
it took me up to make a plank or board ; 'but my time and
labour were little worth, and so they were as well employed _
one way as another. ' '
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place--and this I did out of the short
;p'eces of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship;
but, when I had wrought out some boards, as above, I
made large shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half, one
over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay allmy
tools, nails, and iron-work, and, in a word, to separate
everything at large in their places, that I might come
easily at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock
to hang my guns, and all things that would hang up.

a general Magazine of all necessary things; and I had : :'
everything so ready 'at my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every ;.

fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but death
before me, either that I should be deroured by wild beasts,
murdered by savages, 0r starved to death for want of food.~

wilrll1 creatures, but slept soundly, though it rained all
nig to '

October 1.--~-In the morning I saw, to my great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and was
driven on shore again much nearer the island ; which, as
it was some comfort on one hand, for seeing her sit up-
right, and not broken to pieces, I hopednei the wind
abated, I might get on board, and get some food and
necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on the other hand,
it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I
imagined, if we had 11115th on board, might have saved
the ship, or at least that they Would not hairs been a1.
drOWned as they Were; and that had the then been saved,
we might perhaps hays built us a boat out of the ruins
of the ship, to have carried '11s to Some other part of the
world. I spent great part of this day in perplexin my- .
self on these things; but at length, seeing the ship ost
dry, I Went upon the sand as near, as I mold, and then
swam on board. This day also it continued raining,
though with 'no wind at all. .

From the let of October to the 24th.-----All these days
entirely spent in many several voyages to get all I could
out of the ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of

was the rainy season. V

gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces,
the wind blowing a little harder than before, and was
no more to be seen except the wreck of her, and that
only at low water. I spent this dayin covering and secur-ing the goods which I had saved, that rain might not spoil

68 mm AND ADVENTURES or ROBINSON causes.

Nov. 4.--This day Went abroad with my gun'and my
dog, and killed a wild eat; her skin pretty soft, but her
flesh good for nothing: every creature I killed I took oil
the skins, and preserved them. Coming back by the sea:
shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not

understand ; but was surprised, and almost fiighted, with
; two or three seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well
t; knowing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped
E ' me for that time.
,2; Nov. 6.--A.fter my morning walk, I went to work with
L my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking;
2}, nor was it long before I learned to mend it",
i; ' Nov. 7.--Now it began to be settled fair weather. The
f"? . 7th: 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th
3,2; was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and

with much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape, but never
to please me; and even inthe making, I pulled it in pieces
several times. Nata--I soon neglected my keeping Sun-

' days; for omitting my mark for them on my post, I
forgot which was which. "

- Nov. 13.--This day it rained, which refreshed me ex-
ceedingly, and cooled the earth; but was accompanied
with terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me
dreadfully for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over,

' I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many
little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16.--These three days I spentin maln'ng
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about a
pound, or two pound at most, of powder ; and so putting
the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote
from one another as possible. On one of these three days
I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew
not what to call it. . .
E. _, - Nov. 17 .--,--This day I began to dig behind my tent into
3.3,, '3' the <<iock, to make room for my farther conveniency., Z
t ' Nata--Three things I wanted exceedingly .for this work, __
namely, a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-barrow or bas-
ket; so I desisted from my, work, and began to consider
how to supply that want, and make me" some tools: as
for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows, which were'aTrEMPrs AT MAKING room. 69

properenough, though heavy; but the next thing Was a
shovel or spade ; this was so absolutely necessary, that
: indeed I could do nothing effectually without it, but what
~ kind of one to make I knew not.
w. Nov. 18.---The next day, in searching the woods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, whichinthe Brazils
they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hardness: of this,
with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a
piece, and brought it home too with difiiculty enough, for
it was exceedingly heavy. -
<<is>> The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no
, other way, made me a long while upon this machine ;- for
3; I worked it efi'ectually by little and little into the form
of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly shaped like ours
3 in England, only that the broad part having no iron shod
upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long; how-
" ever, it served well enough for the uses which I had
3; occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe,
:2: made after that fashion, or so long a-making. '
-'2..' 7' :5 I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-
_; barrow: a basket I could not make by any means, hav
ing no such things as twigs, that would bend to make
wicker-ware, at least not yet found out; and as to a
f? wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel,
:3 but that I had no notion of, neither did I know how to
,9,- go about it; besides, I had no possible way to make the
" iron gudgeons for the spindle, or axis, of thewheel, to
run in, so I gave it over; and so, for carrying away the
L " {"7 earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me athing like
9 ,5 ' :1 a hod, which the labourers carry mortar in when they
i; ;,_;i' serve the bricklayers. .
a z a, This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel;
:- and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I
3:" made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less
than four days--I mean always excepting my m'orningfl
. 54" walk with my gun, which I seldom failed; and seldom
" failed also bringing home something to eat. ' :5

time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in' widening 1
and deepening my cave. that it might hold my'goods ;
commodiously,

' Notc..--During all this time I worked-to make this room,
or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a ware-
house,' or magazine, a ln'tchen, a dining-room, and a cel-
lar: as for my lodging I kept to the tent, except that
sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so

' hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me
afterwards to cover all my place. within my pale with. long
poles in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and.
load them with flags and large leaves of trees like a thatch.

December 10,--1 began now to think my cave, or vault,
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too
large), a great quantity of earth fell down from the top ->>
and one side, so much, that, in short, it fiighted me, and
not without reason too; forif I had been under it, Ihad
never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster I had

a great deal of work to do over again 3 forI had the loose
earth to carry out, and, which was of more importance,
Ihad the ceiling to prop up, so' that I might be sure no
more would come down. '

Dec. ,11e--This day I. went to work with it accordingly,
and got'two shores or posts pitched upright to the top,
with two pieces of boards across over each post; this I '
finished the next day; and setting'more posts up with .
boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured;
and the posts standing in rows,. served me for partitions
to part of? my house. . '

Deo.' 17.-4---From this day to the 20th I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts to hang everything up
that could be hung up 2 and now I began to be in some
5. ordenrwithin doors. ' ' -

many days, nay, sometimes weeks tog ether, but I thought
I should never be perfectly secure guntil this wall was
finished, and it 1s scarce credible what inexpressible la-
bour everything was done with, especially the bnng1ng ,
piles out of the woods, and driving them into the gr;ound
_ g for I made them much bigger than I need to have donei'
r ' ' , When this wall was finished, and the outside double
1;; fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded
myself, that if any people were to come on shore there,
they would not perceive anything like a habitation, and
it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter,
. upon a very remarkable occasion.
' During this time I made my rounds 1n the woods for
e game every day,3when the rain permitted me, and made
'7 frequent discoveries in these walks, of something or other,
s to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild .
pigeons, who built, not ,as wood pigeons, in a tree, but
rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the' rocks; and
"'1. taking some young ones, I endeavoured to "breed them
i up tame, and did so .; but when they grew older they flew
f away, which, perhaps, was at first for want of feeding
them, for I had nothing to give them. However, I fre-
quently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which were very good meat.

And now, in the managm agmg my household afi'airs, I
found myself wanting in many things, which I thought
at first it was impossible for me to make, as indeed,g as '
to some of them, it was--for instance, I could never make
a cask to be hoop ed. I had a small runlet or two, as I
observed before, but I could never arrive to the capacity
of making one by them, though I spent many weeks
about it; I could neither put' 1n the heads, nor joint the
E staves so true to one another as to make them hold water,
,3 80 I gave that also over.

: which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of
1 some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me a
light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. In
- the middle of all my labours, it happened that, rumma'g-
' ing my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted
., before, had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry,
. not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the
3" ship came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn
' had been'in the bag was. all devoured with the rats, and
1 I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use--I think it
'~ was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the
' lightning, or some such use--I shook the husks of com

3 ,. as" It was a little before the great rains, just now men-f
'f tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of -
; anything, and not so much as remembering that I had
3: thrown anything there; when about a month after, or
thereabout,_I saw some few stalks of something green
,' shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some
5 plant I had not seen ; but I was surprised and perfectly
} astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about
' ten or twelve ears comelout, which were perfectly green
barley, of the same kind as our European--nay, as our
English barley.
arr It is impossible to express the astonishment and con-
>> fusion of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto
acted upon no religious foundation at all. Indeed, I had
very few notions of religion in my head, or had enter--
" tained any sense of anything that had befallen me, other-
:3 wise than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God ;* without so much as inquiring into the end of Pro-A
"f; vidence in these things, or his order in governing <<eventstff

"climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and es-
pecially, that I knew not how it came there, it startled
" me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had .-
miraculously caused this grain to grow, without any help :4.

of seed sown; and that it so was directed, purely for my
sustenance on that wild miserable place. '

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out
of my eyes, andIbegan to bless myself that such a pro:
digy of nature should happen upon my account; and this

. .- = was the more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all
. along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,

which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, be-
cause I had seen it growinAfi'ica, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Prov
videnoe for my. support, but, not doubting but that there
was more in the place, I went all over that part of the
island Where I had been before, peeping in every corner,
and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not
find any. At last, it occurred to my thought, that Ihad
shook a bag of chickens' meat out in that place, and then
the wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my religi-

ous thankfulness to God's providence began to abate too, '

upon diSoOVBIing.that all this was nothing but what was
common, though I ought .to have been as thankful for
so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence, as
to me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve grains
of corn to remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed
allthe rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven--as

also, that I should throw it out in that particular place, ,.

where, it'being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up

immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else '

at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be sure, in '

their season, which was about the end of June, and lay-
ing up every com, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping
in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with

bread}.~ but it 'was not till the fourth year that I could,
Wowrinyself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even
' then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order

<<for I lost all that I sowed. the first season, by not ob;
serving the proper time--for I sowed it just before the

dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not

as it would have done--of which in its place. *

in Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care
and whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purr
' pose, namely, to make me bread, or rather food; for I

as would have overturned the strongest building that

7;; could be supp posed to have stood on the earth, and a

,. great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half

_ a mile from m; next theasea, fell down with such a ter-
' a

at about eight minutes' distance, with three such shocks, I
rible noise as I never heard in all my life: I perceived
also the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and
I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than

' on the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I
was like one dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth
made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea;
butslthe noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it
were, and, rousing me from the stupified condition I was
in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then
but the hill falling upon my 'tent and all my household
goods, and burying all at Once; and thus sunk my very
soul within me a second time. .

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for

some time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not

heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear of being
buried alive, but sat still upon the ground, greatly cast
down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All
this while I had not the least serious religious thought,
nething but the common " Lord, have mercy upon me I"
and when it was over, that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloudy, as if it would ram; soon after that, the wind rose
by little and little, so that in less than half an hour it
blew a most dreadful hurricane: the sea was all on a sud-
den covered over with foam and froth, the shore was cov-
ered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up
by the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this held

, about three hours, and then began to abate, and in two - 2

hours more it was stark calm, and began to rain veryhard.

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much. ter'
rifled and dejected, when on a sudden it came into my
thoughts, that these winds and rain being the conse-

gquenee of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent

and over, and I might venture into my cave again: with
this thought my spirits began to revive, and, the rain aleo
helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my
tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready
to be beaten down with it: and I was fgrced to go into

e. rnouanrs or unmovme HIS mmnrron. '77

my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear
it should fall on my head.

n This violent rain forced me to a new work, namely,
to cut a hole through my new fortification, like 'a sink, to
let water go out,'which would else have drowned my cave.
After I had been in my cave some time, and found still * -
. ' no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be" m
':- ..-: more composed; and now, to support my spirits, which

' '12" indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store,

' and took a small cup of rum, which, however, I did then,
and always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no more

, _ when that was gone. . .

' .. It continued raining all that night and great part of '
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but, my '
mind being more composed, I began to think of what I '
had best do, concluding, that if the island was subject to
these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a
cave, but I must consider of building me some little hut

in an open place, which I might surround with *a wall as

I had done here, and so make myself secure fi'om wild
beasts or men: but concluded, if I staid where I was, I
should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

. With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from

the place where it stood, which was just under the hang-
ing precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken
again, would certainly fall upon my tent. And I spent
the two next days,~being the 19th and 20th of April, in

.775 contriving where and how to remove my habitation. -

":y The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I
never slept in quiet, and yet the apprehension of lying
abroad without any fence was almost equal to it; but
still, when I looked about,.and saw how everything was
put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how
.safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove.

".1: In the meantime, it occurred to me, that it would re'll',
quire a vast-deal of time for me to do this, and that I'

': must be contented to run the venture where I was, till I
1* had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it so as

to remove to it. So, with this resolution, I composed
myself for a teme, and resolved that I would go to work

with all speed, to build me a wall with pilesand cables, ' '

&.c., in a circle, as before, and set my tent upin it when
it was finished; but that I would venture to stay where
I was till it Was finished, and fit to remove to. This was

the 21st. .
' f' Ap ril 22.mThe next morning I began to consider of

means to put this resolve in execution, but I was at a
great loss about my tools. I had three large litres, and
abundance of hatchets for We carried the hatchets' for
traflic with the Indians , but, with much chapping and -
cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches
and dull; and, though I had a. grmdstone, I could not
turn it, and grind mgy tools too; this cost me a-s much
thought as a statesman would have bestowad upon a grand '
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a
man. At length .I contrived a. wheel with a string, to>>
turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands
at liberty. Node -----1 had never seen any such thing' in
England, or at least not to take notice how it Was done,
though since I have observed it is very common there;
besides that, my grindstone was very large 11nd heavy.
This machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to
perfection.

April 28, 29. d'l'hese two whole days I took up in
.grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well. .

80 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

May 4. --I went a- -fishing, but caught not one fish that.
I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport, when,J ust
going to leave Off, I caught a young dolphin. I Jhad

"' 'made me a long line of some rope yarn, but I had no

hooks,y et I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I

,. caredtoy eat; all which I dried 1n the sun, and ate them dry.

. ,. May 5. ---Worked on the wreck--cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks Off from the
decks, which I tied together, and made swim on shore
when the tide of flood came in.

May 6. --Worked on the wreck--got several 1ron bolts
out Of yher, and other pie'ces of non work, worked very
hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts
of giving it over.

May 7 .--Went to the wreck again, but with an intent
not to work, but found the weight Of the wreck had
brOug ht itself down, the beams being cut; that several
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of '
the hold lay so Open that I could see into it, but almost
full Of water and sand.

May 8. ---.--Went to the wreck, and carried an 1ron crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear Of the
water or sand, I wre'nched Open two planks, and brought '
them on shore also with the tide: I left the non crew in
the wreck for next day.

May 9 .--Went to the wreck, and with the crow made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and
loosened them with the crow, but could not break them

:I felt also the roll of English lead, and could stir it,
. but it was too heavy to remove. 7

May 10,11,12,13,14.--Went every day tO the wreck,
and got a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or '
plank, and two or three hundred weight of non.

May 15 .--'I carried two hatchets, th try if I could not

: his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done
before in the earthquake, and all the,J air looked to my
apprehension as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.

forward towards me, with a long spear, or weapon; in his

my present sins,'which were great--or so much as a
punishment for the general course of my wicked life.
When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert
shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of
what would become of me, or one wish to God to direct

't me whither I should go, or keep me from the danger

'- " which apparently surrounded me, at? well from voracious
creatures as cruel savages : but I was merely thoughtless
'of a God, or 9. Providence, acted like a mere brute from
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of common
sense only, and indeed hardly that.

When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Por-
tugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honour:
ably with, as well as charitably, I had not the least '
thankfulness in my thoughts. When again I was ship-
wrecked, mined, and in danger of drowning on this
island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a
judgment--I only said to myself often, that I was an un-
fortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all
my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was sur-
prised with a kind of ecstacy, and some transports of
soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have "
come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where it ,
began, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, ' I
being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon
the distinguishing goodness of the Hand which had pre-
served me, and had singled me out to be preserved when
all the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry why Provi-
dence had been thus merciful to me: even just the same
common sort of joy which seamen generally have after .-
they have got' safe on shore from a shipwreck, which they
drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost 'f
as soon as it is' over; and all the rest of my life was like it. . '5

Even, when I was afterwards, on due consideration, .
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this
dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of

. all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as f
I saw but a prospect of living, and that I should not 3
starve or perish for hunger, all the 59229 of my amiction ,,

to affect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had
something miraculous m it'; but as soon as ever that part
1. ~ _. of thought was removed, all the impression which was
raised from it wore off also, as I have noted already.
-' - '- 3 Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more
terrible 1n its nature, or.- more immediately directing to
" '3; ' the invisible Power, which alone directs such things, yet
31 no sooner was the first fright over, but the impression it:
had made went off also.5 I had no more sense of God or
C/_1' . his judgments, much less of the present affliction of my
' Loircumstances being from his hand, than if I had been
in the most prosperous condition of life.
. But now, when I beg an to be sick, and a leisurely view
of the miseries of death came to place itself before me ,
when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a.
11 strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the
violence of the fever, conscience, that had slept so long,
f began to aWake, and I began to reproach m self with my
liftspast life, in which I had so evidently, m
1?. EwickedneSs, provoked the justice of God to lay me under
. :2} uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive
a manner.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or third
da of my distemper; and m the violence, as well of the
' fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience,
'; extorted some words from me like praying to God, though
if" I cannot say they were either a prayer, attended with
'32:." desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of mere
.13; fright and distress: my thoughts were confused, the con-
ti.' victions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in
_. 13f. such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head
E: J With the mere apprehensions; and, in these hurries of

-' 'L: a
: ,J
my soul, I knew not what my tongue might express: but
it was rather exclamation, such as, " Lord! what a mis-
erable creature am II If I should be sick, I shall cer-
tainly die for want of help, and what will become of me!"
Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no
more for a good while.

In this interval, the good advice of my father came to
my mind, and presently his prediction, which I men-
tioned' in the beginning of this story, namely, that, if I
did take this foolish step ,God would not bless me, and I
would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having ne-
glected his counsel, when there might be none to assist
in my recovery." Now," said I, aloud, " my dear father' s
words are come to pass: God's justice has overtaken me,
and I have none to help or hearJ me. I rejected the voice
of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture
or station of life wherein I might have been happy and
easy ; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know
the blessing of it from my parents; I left them to mourn
over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the
consequences of it. I refused their help and assistance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and would have
made everything easy to me, and now I have difliculties
to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to sup-
port, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice."
Then I cried out," Lord, be my help , for I am in great
distress i"

This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that I
had made for many years. But I return to my journal.

June 28. ----Having been somewhat refieshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely of, I got up,'

 

and? thoug h the fright and terror of my dream was very '

great, yet 8I considered that the fit of the ague would re-
turn again the next day, and now was my time to get

something to refresh and sup port myself, when I should - I,

. be ill: and the first thing I didp I filled a large square oase-
bottle with water, and set it upon my tableg' 1n reach of my
bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and
mixed them together, then I got me a piece of the goatsfi'enosuMW snnrous REFLECTIONS. " ' 8_7

53 What is the earth gand sea, of which I have seen so

.' '--'-whence are We ?

*3 Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of
:1 _ _ these conclusions; and, therefore, it restedup oi me with
"1;; the greater force, that it must needs be that God had ap<<
pointed all this to befall me----that I was brought to this

-' V 5' pened 1n the World. Iramediately itf
_Why has God done this to me ? What have I done to

,My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry,
as if I had blasphemed; and methought it spoke to me like
a voice:----" Wretchl dost thou ask what thou hast done '1'
Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself
.what thou hast not done '2 Ask why it is that thou wert
not long ago destroyed ? Why wert thou not drowned
in Yarmouth Roads '2 killed in ythe fi g,ht when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man- -of-war ? devoured by the wild
beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned HERE, when all
the crew perished but thyself ? Dost thou ask, What have
I done ? "

I was struck with these reflections, as one astonished,
and had not a word to say--no, not to answer to my self,
4 but rose up, pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat,
and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed;
but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no in-
clination to sleep, so I sat down in my chair, and light-
ed my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the appre-
hensions of the return of my distemper terrified me very
much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians
take no physio but their tobacco for almost all distemp ers ,
and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests,
which was quite cured, and some also that was green,
and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt ; for in this chest
I found a cure bothy for soul and body. I opened the
chest, and found what I had looked for, namely the to
bacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too,
I took out one of the Bibles, which I mentioned before, '
and which, to this time, I had not found leisure, or, so
much as inclination, to look into--I say, I took it out and
, brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to>> make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my
distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but I
tried several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it
should hit one way or other.- I first took a piece of a
leaf, and chewed it in my month, which indeed, at first.
almost stupified my brain, the tobacco being green and89

strong, and I had not been much used to it; then I took
1.3.1 some, and steeped it an hour er two 1n some rum, and
.3 resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and, lastly,
~ I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
., over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well
" ~-'-..:~ for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held almost to suf-
fifocation. .3ym ~
.ju ; In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible,
~' and beg an to read,- but my head was too much disturbed
{iwith the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time ,
,. .3only,' having Opened the book casually, the first words that
'. 44 occurred to me were these: --" Call on me in the day of
-- ~ trouble, and I will deliver; and thou shalt glorify me. "
l 'v The words were very apt to my case, and made some
._ , impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them,
though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for
. bmeing delivered, the word had no sound, as I may, say to \
' 4 -The thing was so remote, so impossible, m my ap-
prehensmn of thin gs, that I began to say, as the children
of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat," Can
;;' God spread a table' 1n the wilderness ?" So I beg an to
"z ,7}.- . say, " Can God himselfdeliver me from this place ?" And
2'53: as it was not for many years that' any hope appeared,
this prevailed very often upon my thoughts. But, how.
iii; ever, the words made a very great 1mpression upon me, -
and I mused upon them very often. It grew now late,
'7 and the tobacco had, as I said, dosed my head so much,
. _ that I inclined to sleep, so that I left my lamp burning 1n
i the cave, lest I should want anything in the ni g,ht and
.-- . went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never"
had done 1n all my life--I kneeled down, and prayed to
{$1.1 God to fulfil the promise to me, that, if I called upon him
".5 in the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my
broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum,
in which I had steep ed the tobacco, which was so strong
1, and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get it
'1'. down. Immediately upon this, I went to bed, and found
if presently it flew up into my head violently, but I fell into

1;; a sound sleep, and waked no more, till, by the sun, it
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon

the next day ,nay, to this day, I am partly of the opinion,
that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise, mgI know not how I
should lose a day out of my reckoning,' in the days of the

week, as it appeared, some years after, I had done: for f

if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the Line, I
should have lost more than a day , but in my account it
was lost, and I never knew which Way.

Be that, however, one way or other, when I awaked, I
found myself exeeedingly refreshed, and myp s pirits lively
and cheerful. When I got up, I was strong er than I was
the day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry,
'and,' in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued
much altered for the better. this was the 29th.

The 80th was my well day of course, and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far: I killed a
sea-fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought
them home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I '
ate some more of the turtle' 3 eggs, which were very good.
This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had sup
posed did me good the day before, namely, the tobacco

. rsteep ed in mm , only, I did not take so much as before,

nor did I chew an of the leaf, or hold my head over the
smoke, however, was not so well the next day, which
was the 1st of July, as I hop ed I should have been; for
I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.

July 2 ---I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dosed my self with it as at first, and doubled the
quantity which I drank.

July 3 .--I missed the fit for good and all, though I did
not recover my full strength forg some weeks after. While
I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceed-
ingly upon this Scripture, " I will deliver thee ;" and the
impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind,'
in bar of my ever expecting it: but as I was discouraging
myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that
I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main
afliiction, thatI disregarded the deliverance I had received,
and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions
as these: namely, Have I not been delivered, and Won:7 g 98' 'nomroar IN assume m 3mm. 91 -
derfully too,' from sickness-4min: the most distressing ' .
_' condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me ?
and what notice had I taken of .it ? had I done my part ?
_' God had delivered me, but I had not glorified hime-that
is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a
L deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance ?
7?"- F This touched my heart very much, and immediately'I
- , 7. kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my recovery
' ,r. ,from my sicknessg" , . -
" .--' <<'4 July Its--In the morning Itook the Bible; and, begina

.' ning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read
: it, and imposed upon myself to read a while every monia
i ing and every night, not tying myself to the number of
:t ,5 chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me.
' Itwas not long after Iset seriouslytothis work, butIfound
1: ' my heart more deeply and sincerely afi'ected with the
; wickedness of my past life; The impression of my dream
" revived; and the words, "All these things have not brought
_ thee to repentance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I was
' earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it
happened providentially that very day, that, reading the '
' Scripture, I came to these words: "He is exalted aPrince
and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remission",
" I threw down the book, and,with myheart as well as my
: hand lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I
'_ cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou Son of David! Jesus, thou
exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance I" '
'. This was the first time that 1 could say, in the true
- Sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now
i I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with a true
: Scripture view of hope, founded on the encouragement of
_ the word of God ; and from this time, I may say, I began
,i tohave hope that God would hear me.
3 it Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,

f' Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a difi'erent sense
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no no-
tion of anything being called deliverance, but my being
3 delivered from the captivity I Was in: for, though I was
indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly
a prison to me, and that in the worst sense of the word;'4>>:

but now I learnt to take it in another sense. Now Ilooked
back on my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
.so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but de-
liverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my
comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did
not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of
it; it was all of no consideration in comparison of this;
and I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it,
that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they
will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing
than deliverance from afiiiction.
(But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not less miser-
able as to my way of living,yet much easier to my mind;
and my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading

the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher I

nature, I hada great deal of comfort within, which till
now I knew nothing of: also, as my health and strength
returned, I bestirred myself to furnish myselfwith every-
thing that I wanted, and make my way of living as regu-

' lar as I could.>>

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-

' ployed in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little
and a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his
strength after a fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be ima-
gined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced.

The'application which 1 made use of was perfectly new, '

and, perhaps, what had' never cured an ague before;

neither can I recommend it to any one to practise by this '

experiment; and though it did carry off the fit, yet it
rather contributed to weaken me, for I had fiequent con-
vulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time.

I learnt from it also this, in particular, that being .

abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing
to my health that could be, especiallyin those rains which
came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for,

as the rain which came in a dry season was always most ,

accompanied with such storms; so I, found this rain was
much more dangerous than the rain which fell in Sep-

tember and October.

. I-r was the 15th of July that I began to take a more par-
_, ticular survey of the island itselfg' I went up the creek
,. first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I
" found, after I came about two miles up ,that the tide did
not flow any higher, and that it was no more than alittle
brook of running water, very fresh and good; but this
being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some
parts of it, at least not enough to run into any stream,
so as it could be perceived. 0
deg! On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant sa-
vannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and, on the rising parts of them, next to the higher
grounds (where the water, as it might supposed, never
Nerf-lowed), I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and
, growing to a great and very strong stalk; there were divers
, 1 others plants, which I had no notion of, or understand-
:' ing about, and might perhaps have virtues of their own,
{which I could not find out. . _
I searched forthe cassava root, which the Indians in
all that climate make their bread of, but I could find none.
- I saw large plants of aloes, but did not then understand '
them; I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want
7 of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myselfwith these
_ discoveries for this time, and came back musing with my-
self what course I might take to know the virtue and good-
ness of any of the fruits or plants whichIshould discover,
but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I hadWW.._i.;%_#r:vfkv--Wn:jm.--_,,Wssfif "_ . "W1 , fifties. a, _.- Ass ' pr.

i ' ' made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that
I I knew little of the plants of the field; at least, very little
that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.
The next day ,the 16th, I went up the same way yagain ,
and, after going something farther than I had done the
day before, I found the brook and the savannas beg an to
cease, and the country became more woody than before.
In this part I found difi'erent fruits, and particularly I
found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
r grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread indeed over
the trees, and the clusters of grapes were now just in their
5, . prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising disco-
; very, andeas exceedingly glad of them; buthas warned
by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remembering
that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes
' killed several of our Englishmen who were slaves. there,
' by throwing them into fluxes and fevers; butIfound an
,2 excellent use~for these grapes, and that was to cure or dry
f. them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins
are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were,
as wholesome and as gagreeable to eat, when no grapes
f might b5 had.
b; I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
: habitation, which, by the way, was the first n1g,ht as I
1- might say, I had lain from home. In the night I took
:2 my gfirst cyontrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept-

' well, and the next morning proceeded upon my journey,
L f travelling near four miles, asI might judge by the length
*, ' of the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills

' on the south and north side of me.

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where.
the country seemed to descend to the, west; and a little
sp pring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the
hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every-
; thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish of spring,
- thatg it looked like a planted garden. -

r. I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley y,
3' surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed
with other afliicting thoughts), to think that this was all

my own, that I was king and lord of all this country in.
defeasibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could
convey it, I might have it in inheritance, as completely
y as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here abund.
, 1 arms of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, 'and citron trees, _
but all wild, and few bearing any fruit; at least, not
i then: however, the green limes that I gathered were not
only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed
their juice afterwards with water, which made it very
_ wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. ,
-'n I found now I had business enough to gather and carry
' home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well of grape ' ,4
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season,
, which I knew was approaching. ' ; .
_ t-fi In order to do this, I gathered a'great heap of grapes
~ in one place, and a lesser heap in another place ;:, and a
2 great parcel of limes and lemons in another place 3 and
_ taking a few of each with me, I travelled homeward, and
' resolved to come again and bring a bag or sack, or what
I could make, to carry the rest home.
, 0"! Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey,
I came home (so I must now call my tent and my caveg;
. . but before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled ; the ric .
;' ness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken
- them and bruised them, they were good for little or no-
' thing: as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring
but a few;

course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dryin the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.
When I came home fryom thisj Journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure, on the fruitfulness of that valley, and
the pleasantness of the situation, the security fi'om stems
on that side of the water, and the wood; and Concluded,
that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode, which
was by far the worst part of the country. Up on the
whole, I began to consider of removing my habitation,

find to lookga'n out for a place, equally safe as where I now

was situated, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part
of the island.

This thought ran long' in my head, and I was exceed-
ingly fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the
place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view of
it, and to consider that I was now by the sea-side, where
it was at least possible that something might happen to
my advantage, and that the same ill fate that brought
mehither, might bring some other unhappy matches to
the same place; and though it was scarce probable that
any such thing should ever happen, yet, to enclose myself
among the hills and woods in the centre of the island,
was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an
affair not only improbable, but impossible; and that,
therefore, I ought not by any means to remove.

However, I'was so enamoured with this place that I
spent much of my time there for the whole remaining

part of the month of July, and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove,y et I built

'me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it, at a dis-

tance, with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as hih
as I could reach, well staked, and filled between with
brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two
or three nights together, always going over it with a ladder,
as before; so that I fancied now I had my country house,
and my sea-coast house, and" this work took me up the
beginmn gof Au st.

I had but newy finished my fence, and began to enjoy

' the rains were extraordinary
l About the beginning of August, as I said, I had fin-
ished my bower, and begun to enjoy myself. The 8d of
gust I found the grpa es I had hung up were perfectly
- dried, and, indeed, were 1)excellent good raisins of the sun;
so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was~
7 very happy that I did so, for the rains which followed<<
ff would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of
-' my winter food; for I had above two hundredP large
V bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down,
and carried most of them home to my cave, but it began
_ to rain; and from thence, which was the 14th of August,
it rained more or less "every day till the middle of Octo-
ber, and sometimes so violently that I could not stir out
:of my cave for several days.
' In this season I was much surprised with the increase
of my family .I had been concerned for the loss of one
of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as Ithoug ht, had
beeny dead; and I heardy no more tale or tidings gof her,
till, to my astonishment, she came home, about the end
_ 7 of August, with three kittens. This was the more strange
to me, because, though I had killed a wild cat, as I
called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite dif-
' ferent kind from our European cats; yet the young cats
were the same kind of house breed like the old one;- and
. both my cats being females, I thought it very strange.
but from these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pes-
f . tered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin,
'-- .or,wild beasts, and to drive.them from my house as much
as possible.
, <<. From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain,
'.so that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to
be much wet. In this confinement I began to be strait-
ened for food; but venturing out twice, I one day killed
a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th,,found-a

Very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food
was regulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my break-
fast, a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my
dinner broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I had no ves-
sel to boil or stew anything), and two or three of the
turtle's eggs for supper.

' During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I
worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave;
and, by degrees, worked it 011 towards one side, till I came
to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out,

"which came beyond my fence, or wall; and so I came in
find out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying
so open ; for, as Ihad managed myself before, I was in
a perfect enclosure, whereas now I theught I lay exposed;
and yet I could not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had ever seen
upon the island being a goat.
September the 30th.----I was now come to the unhappy
\ anniversary of my landing--1 cast up the notches on my
post, and found I liad been .on shore three hundred and
sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting
it apart to a religious exercise, prostrating myself to the
ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing my-
self to God, acknowledging his righteous judgment upon
me, and praying to him to have mercy on me, through
Jesus Christ; and having not tastedthe least refresh-
ment for twelve hours, even till the going down of the
sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake. and a bunch of grapes,
and went to bed, finishing the day'as I began it.
- I had all this time observed no Sabbath day, for as at
first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after
some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a
longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so
did not really know what any of the days were; but now,
having cast up the days as above, I found I had been there
a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every
seventh day for a Sabbath; though'I found, at the end
of my account, I had lost a day or two of my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I
contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write

, continuing a daily memorandum of other thing s.

. The rainy season and the dry season begaSS1 now to
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as
to provide for them accordingly. But I bought all my
experience before I had it; andg this, I am going to relate.
was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made
at all. I have mentioned, that I had saved the few ears
of barley and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring

. up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were
' V about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley

and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the-

rains, the sun being in its southern position going from me.
, Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground, as Well as I
could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two
parts, I sowed my ygrain; but as it was sowing, it casually

occurred to my thought, that I would not sow it all ayt
first, because I ydid not know when was the proper time
for it; so I sowed about two-thirds of the seeds, leaving

7.; .about a handful of each. 7

,z'. It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so,
3'3 for not one grain of that I sowed this time came to any-
' ' thing; for the dry months following, the earth having had
, no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist

, its growth, and never came up at all, till the wet season
had come again, and then it grew as if it had been newly
sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trialu'g 1n; and I dug up a
piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest
of my seed 1n February, a little before the vernal equinox ,
and this, having the rainy months of March and April to
water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very

   
  
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but a small quan-
.27 tity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half
a peek of each kind.
But by this experience I was made master of my busi-
ness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to

good crop , but having part of the seed left only, and not '
sow, "and that I might expect two seed times and two
harvests every year. ,

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery;
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains
. were over, and the weather began to settle, which was
about the month of November, I made a visit up the
country to my bower, where, though I had not been some
months, yet I found all things just as I left them. The
circle or double hedge that I had made, was not only firm
and entire, but the stakes which I had out 01f of some trees
that grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with
long branches," much as a willow tree usually shoots the
first year after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree
to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised,
and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees grow--
and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much
alike as I could--and it is scarce credible how beautiful a

figure they grew into in three years; so that, though the ,

hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in dia- '

meter, yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon

covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufiicient to
lodge under all the dry season.

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and
make me a hedge like this in a semicircle round my wall,
I mean that of my first dwelling, which I did ; and placing
the trees, or stakes, in a double row; at above eight yards'
distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and
were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found now, that the seasons of the year might gene-
rally be. divided, not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons,
which were generally thus :--

Half February,

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as

. the winds happened to blow ; but this was the general ob-

servation I made. After I had found, by experience, the
ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care 7
to furnish myself with provision beforehand, that I might
not be obliged to go out; and I sat within doors as much
as possibleg during gthe wet months.

In this time I found much employment (and very suit-
able also to the time), for I found great occasion of many
things which I had no way to furnish my self with, but by
hard labour and constant application , particularly ,Itried
inany ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I

' _ could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would

do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now,
that when gI was a boy I used to take great delight in
standing at a basketmaker's in the town where mygfather
lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being,
as boys usually are, very oificious to help, and a great
observer of the manner how they workedP those things,
and sometimes lent a hand, I had by this means so full
knowledge of the methods of it, thatly wanted nothing but
the materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs
of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might
possibly be as tough as the sallows, and willows, and

employed myself in making (as wellns I could) a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up
anything, as I had occasion; and though I did not finish
them v handsomely, yet I made them sufliciently ser-
viceable or my purpose; and thus afterwardsI took care
never to be without them : and as my wicker-ware decayed,
I made more; especially I made strong deep baskets to
place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come
to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difiiculty, and employed a world
of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how
to supply two wants: I had no vessels to hold anything
that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost
full of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the common
size, and others, which were case-bottles, square, for the
holding of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a
pot to boil anything in, except a great kettle which I
saved out of the ship, and which was too big for such uses
as I desired it for, namely, to. make broth, and stew a bit
of meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have

had, was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to .'

malke one; however, I found a contrivance for that too
at set.

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes
of piles; and in this wicker-work, all the summer, ordry

season, when another business took me up more time

than it could be imagined I'could spare.

CHAPTER VIII.

/

I MENTIONED before, that I had a great mind to see the
whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and
so on, to where I built my bower, and where I had an
opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island.
I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on
that side. So, taking my gun and hatchet, and my dog,
and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with
two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch oi raisins in my

pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When I had
passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came

within view of the sea to the west; and it being a very
clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or
continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extend-
ing from the west to the west-south-west, at avery great
distance; by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or
twenty leagues ofl'.

' I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America;
and, as I concluded by all my observations, must be near
the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by
savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a
worse condition than I was now; and therefore I ac-
quiesced 1n the dispositions of Providence, which I began
now to own, and to behave ordered everything for the
best--I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left afliict-
ing myself with fruitless ywishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered,
that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certain
ly, one time or other, see some vessels pass or repass one

"Way or other; but if not, then it was the savage coast

between the Spanish country and Brazil, .the inhabitants

.Of which are indeed the worst of savages; for they are

eannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and de-
your all the human bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely for- '

ward. I found that side of the island where I now was
much pleasanter than mine--the Open or savanna fields

sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very fine

woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain would I
have caught one, if possible, tPo have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to speak to me; I did, after some pains-

taking, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down with
a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home, but

it was some years before I could make him speak. How-

ever, at last I taught him to call me by my name very
familiarly: but the accident that followed, though it be
altrifle, willbeverydiverting inits 11.18.09 .1112'".-

in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them to be, and
foxes, but they differed greatly from all the other kinds
I had met with ; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them,
though I killed several: but I had no need to be ventur-
ous; for I had no want of food, and of that which was
very good too ; especially these three sorts, namely, goats,
pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which, added to my grapes;
Leadenhall Market could not have furnished a better
table than I, in proportion to the company: and though
my case was deplorable encugh, yet I had great cause
for thankfulness, that I was not driven to any extrem-
ities for food; but rather plenty, even to dainties.

,I never travelled in this journey above two miles out-
right in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns'
and returns to see what discoveries I could make, that I
came wearied enough to the place where Iresolvedto sit
downfor all night; and then either reposed myself in a
tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set up-
right in the ground, either from one tree to another, or so
as no wild creature could come at me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the
island for here, indeed, the shore was covered with in-
numerable turtles, whereas, on the other side, I had found
but three in a year and a half. . Here was also an infinite
number of fowls of many kinds, some of which I had not

seen before, and many of them very good meat; but such .

. as I knew not the names of, except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very \

sparing of my powder and shot; and therefore had more
mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could better
feed 0n: and though there were many goats here, more
than on the other side of the island, yet it was with much
more difficulty- that I could come near them--the coun-
try being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner
than when I was on the'hills. .
. I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter
:than mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to re-
move; for, as, I was fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I seemed, all the while I was here, to

be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home; however,

' I travelled along the shore of the sea towards the east,

I suppose, about twelve miles; and then, setting up a
great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would
go home again: and the next journey I took should be
on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to' my post again--of which in
its place.

. I took another way to-come back than that I 'went,

' thinking I could keep all the island so much in my view, '.

that I could not miss finding my first dwelling by view- ,

ing the country--but I found myself mistaken ; for, being

come about two or three miles, I found myself descended
into a very large valley, but so surrounded with hills,'and
those hills covered with woods, that I could not see which

i ' It happened, to my further misfortune, that the wea-
ther proved hazy for three or four days, while I was in
this valley; and not being able to see the sun, I wandered
about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find
out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back the
same way I went; and then, by easy journies, I turned
homeward, the weather being exceedingly hot, and my
gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.

: In this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it, caught

' it,- and saved it alive from the dog. Iihad a great mind
to bring it home, if I could: for I had often been musing
whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and
so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me
when m powder and shot should be spent.

come into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-
bed : this little wandering journey, without a settled place
of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own
house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement
to me compared to that; and it rendered everything
about me so comfortable, that I resolved I would never
go a great way from it again, while it should be my lot
to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale my-
self after my long journey; during which, most of the
time was taken up in the weighty affair of maldng a cage
for my poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and
to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began
to think of the poor kid which I had pent in'within my
little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, and

give it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where

I left it; for, indeed, it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food. I went and out boughs of trees,
and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw
it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, tolead

it away y; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I-

had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog ,
and, as I continually fed it, the creature became so lov-
ing, so gentle, and so y,fond that it became from that time
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 80th of September in the same
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of my
landing on the island, having now been there two years,
and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day
I came there. I spent the3 whole day in humble and
thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
, which my solitary condition was attended with, and with-
out which it might have been infinitely more miserable.
I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God had been
pleased to discover to me even that it was possible I might

be more happy in this solitary condition than I shoguld.

have been in at liberty of society, and m all the pleasures
of the world--that he could fully make up to me the de-

_!ficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human
society, by his presence and the communication of his
grace to my soul,' supporting, comforting, and encourag-
ing me to depend upon his providence here, and hope for
his eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I beg an sensibly to feel how much'

more happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable
circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I
led all the past part of my days: and now, having changed
both my sorrows and my joys, my very desires altered,
my affections changed their gust, and my delights were

perfectly new from what they were at my first coming,
or, indeed, for the two yearsp aspt. .

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for
viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my con-
dition would break out up on me on a sudden, and my

ryheart would die within me to think of the woods,
the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a
prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited Wilderness, without redemption.
In the midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this
would break out upon me like a storm, and made me wring
my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it would
take me in the middle of my work, and I would imme-
diately sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for

an hour or two together, and this was still worse to me , '

for if I could burstg out into tears, or vent myself by words,
it would go of; and the grief, having exhausted itself,
would abite.'

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts
--I daily read the word of God, and applied all the com--
forts of iyt to my present state. One morning, being very
sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, "I will never

leave thee, nor forsake thee L' Immediately it occurred, '

that these words were to me; why else should they be
directed m such a manner, just aty the moment when I

was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God
'and man? " Well then," said I, "if God does not for-

sake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters
it though the world should all forsake me" seeing, on the

other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the fa.
vour and blessing of God, there would be no comparison
in the loss.

From this moment I beg an to conclude" in my mind,
that it was possible for me gto be more happy in this for-
_ saken, solitary condition, than it was probable I should
have ever been 1n any particular state' m the world; and
with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for
bringing me to this place.

I know not what it was, but something shocked my
mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.
" How canst thou be such an hypocrite," said I, even an-
dibly, "to pretend to be thankful for a condition, which,
however thou mayst endeavour to be contented with, thou
wouldst rather pray yheartily to be delivered from? " So
I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked
God for being there, yet Ig sincerely gave thanks to God
for opening my eyes, by whatever afid'icting providences, to
see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my
wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or
shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for direct-
ing my friendy' 1n England, without any order of mine, to
pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me after- ,
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. '

Thus, and 1n thisdisp ositionofmind, Ibeg anmy third
year: and though I have not given the reader the trouble
of so particular an account of my works this year as at
the first, yet' 1n general it may be observed, that I was
very seldom idle, having regularly divided my time 110- .
cording to the several daily employments that were before
me--such as, first, my duty to God, and reading the
Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time for,
thrice every day; secondly, the going abroad with my
gun for food, which generally took me up three hours
every morningwhen it did not rain; thirdly ,the ordering,
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
catched for my supply--these took up greatp art of the
day; also it 1s to be considered, that m the middle of the
day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the
heat was too great-to stir out; so that about four hours

' GREAT LABOUR IN MAKING A SHELF.

' ' ' in the evening was all the time Icould be supposed to
- ' work in; with this exception, that sometimes I changed
my hours of hunting and working, and went to work in
the morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
. , To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be
added the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many
hours which, for want of tools, want of help and want of
skill, everything that I did took up out of my time--for
example, I was full two-and-forty days making me aboard
for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas,
two sawyers, with their tools and saw-pit, would have out

six of them out of the same tree in half a day.

My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was
to be cut down, because my board was to be a broad one.
The tree I was three days of cutting down, and two more
cutting of the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece
of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I re-
duced both the sides of it into chips, till it began to be
light enough to move; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and flat, as a board, from end to end;

,. then, turning that side downward, cut the other side till

fr I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and
smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of
my hands in such a piece of work; .but labour and pa-
tience carried me through that and many other things:
I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why
.'so much of my time went away with so little work, namely,
that what might bea little to be done with help and tools,
was a vast labour, and required a prodigious time to do
alone, and by hand. '

But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I '
went through many things, and indeed everything that
my circumstances made necessary for me to do, as will
appear by what follows. . 7 '

I was now, in the months of November and December,

' expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured or dug up for them was not great; for, as I ob-
served, my seed of each was not above the quantity oi
half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in
"the dry season; but now my crop promised very well.

1* e:

 

.'.
when on a sudden' I found I was in danger 'of lesing it
all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce

possible to keep from it; as first, the ogats and wild
creatures which I called hares, which, tasting the sweet-
ness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it
came up, and ate it so close that it could get no time to
shoot up into stalks.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an enclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a ggreat deal" of
toil; and the more, because it required a great deal of
speed, the creatures daily spoiling my corn. However,
as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I
got it totally well fenced in about three weeks' time, and
shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my
dog to guarditinthenig ht, t ymghimup toastake at
the gate, g1lwhere he would stand and bark all night long;_
so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and
the corn grew very strong and Well, and began to ripen
apace.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; for, going along by the place to
see how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with
fowls I know not how many sorts, which stood as it were
watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly
' among them (for Ihad always my gunwith me)? I had
no sooner shot, but there rose up a little. cloud of fowls,
which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly for I foresaw that, in a few
days, they would devour all my h0p es; that I should be '
starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all--and what
to do I Could not tell; however, Iresolved not to lose my
corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day.
In the first place, I went ameng it to see what damage
was already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of
it; but that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss was
not so great, but the remainder was like to be a good crop,
if it could be saved.

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I
Could easily see all the thieves sitting upon all the trees

about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away, and
the event proved it to be so; for, as Iwalked off as if Iwas
gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, but they dropped
down one by one, into the corn again. I was so provoked,
that I couldy not have patience to stay till more came an,
knowing that every grain that they ate now was, as it
might be said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence; but,
coming up to the hedge, I fired again gain, and killed three
of them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up,
and served them as we serve notorious thieves in Eng- ,
land, namely, hanged themin chains for a terrorto others.
It' is impossible to' magm e almost, that this should have
such an Peffect as it had; for the fowls would not only not
come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all thaty part
of the island, and I could never see a bird near the place
as long as my scarecrows hung there.
This I was veryg lad of, you may be sure; and about
\ the latter end of December, which was our second har.
vest of the year, I reaped my com.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe, or a sickle, to cut it
down, and all I could do was to make 1311c as well as I
' could, out of one of the broadswords, or cutlasses, which
I saved among the arms out of the ship. However, as
my crop was but small, I had no difficulty to cut it down:
in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing 011' but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had
made, and. so rubbed it out with my hands , and, at the
end of all my harvesting, I found, ythat out of my half
peek of seed Iy had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley ,that is to say, by my guess,
for I had no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me; and
I foresaw that in time it would please God to supply me
with bread: and yet here I was perplexed again, for I
neither knew how to grind nor make meal of my corn,
nor, indeed how to clean it and part it; nor,1f made into
.. . meal, how to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet
{v I knew not howto bake it. These things being addedy to
3 my desire of having a good quantity for- store, and to
L' , secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of

this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next
season, and, in the meantime, to em ploy all my study and
hours of working to accomplish this great work of pro-
viding _my self with corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that I now worked for my bread.
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon, namely, the strange multitude of
littleg things necessaryinthe providing, producing, curing g,
dressing, making, andfinishing this one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made more
and more sensible of it every hour, even after I got the
first handful of seed corn, which, as I have said, came
up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise. ,

First, I had no pglou h to turn the earth, no spade or
shovel todig it. Well, thisIcon queredby making awooden
spade, as Ig observed before; but this did my work but in
a wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many
days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it notonly wore

out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and made.

it be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content to work

it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the.

p.erformance When the corn was sowed, I had no har-
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag agreat
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch the earth, as it
may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.
-When it Wasgr growing, or grown, I have observed already

how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it, mow or '

reap it, cure or carry it home, thresh, part it from the
chafi, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves
to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an
oven to bakeit' m; and all these things I did without, as
shall be observed, and yet the corn was an inestimable
comfort-and advantage to me too. .But all this, as I said,
made everything laborious and tedious to me, but that
there was no help for: neither was my time so much loss
to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it

was every day appointed to these works; and as I resolved ,/

to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater

quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply my-
self wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself
with utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for making the corn, when I had it fit for my
use. .

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before Idid this,
I had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which,
when it was done, was a very sorry one indeed, and very
heavy, and required double labour to work with it ; how-
ever, I went through that, and sowed my seeds in two
large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could
find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all out off that wood'which
I had set before, which I knew would grow; so that in one
year's time I knew I should have a quick or living hedge,
that would want but little repair. This work was not so
little as to take me up less than three months; because
great part of that time was in the wet season, when I
could not go'abroad. ' r. ; _'

Within doors, that is, when it rained and I could not
go out, I found employment on the following occasions ;
always observing, that all the while I was'at work, I
diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching
him to speak; and I quickly learnt him to knowlhis own
name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud, Penn, which
was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by
any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not, my
work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I
had a great employment upon my hands, as follows :
namely, '1 had long studied, by some means or other, to
make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted
sorely, but knew not where to come at them: however,
considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but,
if I could find: out any suitable clay, I might betch up
some such pot as might, being dried by the sun; be hard

1 enough and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold
anything that was dry, and required to be kept so; and as
this was necessaryin preparing corn, meal, &c.-, which was

Ir would make the redder pity me, or rdther laug h at me,
to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste,
what edd, .misshappen', ugly things I made; how many of

hastily and how: many fell to pieces with only removing,
as well before as after they were dried: and, in a word,
how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig
it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, yI could
not make aboIveI two large earthen ugly things--I cannot

However, as the sun Baked these two ye rydry and hard,
I lifted ItheIm yery gently _up, and set them down again in
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose
for them,~ that theynng ht not break; and, as between the

was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to my self, that
certainly they- might be made to burn whole, if they would
burn broken.

This set me to study how to order myfire, so as to make
it burn me some pots. Ihad no notion of a kiln such as
the potters burn' m, or of glazin them with lead, thong h
I had some lead to do it with; ut I placed three large
pip pkins, andtwo or three pots, in apile,p one upon another,
and plaeed my firewood all round it, with a great heap
of embers under them: I piled the firewith freshgr fuel round
the outside, and up on the top, till I saw the potsjn the
inside red hot quite through, and observed that they did
not crack at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them

stand 111 that heat about five or six hours, till I found one '

of them, though it did not crack, did melt, or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the
violence of the heat, and would have run yinto glass if I
had gone on; so I slacked my fire gryaduall ,till the pots
beg an to abate of the red colour; and watching them all
I nig eg,ht that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the
morning I had three ve rygood, I will, not say handsome,
pip pkins, and .two otherry earthen pots, as hard burnt as
could be desired," and one of, them perfectly glazed with
the running of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no
sort .of earthen-ware for my use; but I must needs say,
as to the shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as
any one may suppose, when I ,had no way of melting
them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman
would make pies that never learnt Ito raise paste. ,

, NoI Joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal
to mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that
would \bear the fire, and I had hardly patience to stay
till they were cold, before I set one upon the fire again
with some water 111, it, to boil- me some meat, which it did
adm1rIably well; and with a piece of kid, I made some

Or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, -there was no
thought of arriving to that perfection of art with one
pair of hands. To supply this want, I was at a great
loss; for, of all the trades in the world, I was'as perfectly
unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever ; neither
had I any tools to go about it with. Ispentmany a day
to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and

_ make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except

what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to
dig, or cut out ;, nor indeed were the rocks in the island
of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a heavy

pestle, nor would break the corn without filling it with
_ sand; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for

a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed much
easier; and, getting one as big as I had strength to stir.
I rounded it, and formed it on the butside with my axe
and hatchet; and then, with the help of fire and infinite
labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil
make their canoes. 'After this I made a great heavy
pestle, or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and
this I prepared and laid by'against I had my next crop of
corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound,
my corn, or meal, to. make my bread.

My next difi'iculty was to make a sieve, or scarce. to
dress my meal, and part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not see it possible I could have any
bread. This was a most diflicult thing, so much as but
to think'on; for, to be sure, I had nothing like the ne-

cessary things to make it with--I mean fine thin canvass, '

or stufi, to scarce the meal through. And here I was at a
full stop for many months; nor did I lmow really what ,to
do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags; Ihad
goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave or spin it;
and had I known how, here were no tools to work it with.
All the remedy that I found for this was, that at 'last I
did remember I had among the seamen's clothes which
were saved out of the ship,'some neckcloths of calico, or

" muslin; and with some pieces of these I made three small

,: ' sieves, but proper enough for the work, and thus I made
shift for some years. How I did afterwards, I shall show
in its p.1ace

TheP baking part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I should make bread when I came to have corn;
for, first, I had no yeast: as to that part, there was no
supplying the want, so I did not concern myself much
about it. But for an oven, I was, indeed, in great pain.
At length I found out an expedient for that also, which
was this :--I made some earthen vessels very broad, but
not deep; that is to say, about two feet diameter, and
not above .nineinches deep; these I bumtin the fire, as .
I had done the others, and laid them by; and when I
wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the 'hearth',
which I had paved with some square tiles of my own
making and burning also--but I should not call them
square. ' '

When the firewood was burnt pretty much into embers,
or live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so
'as to cover it all over, and there I let them lie, till the
hearth was very hot; then, sweeping away all the embers,
I set down my loaf, or loaves, and, whelming down the
earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round the
outside of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat: and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked
my barley-loaves, and became in a little time a good
pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made myself several
cakes of the rice, and puddings: indeed,'I made no pies,
neither had I anything to put into them, supposing I had.
except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me
up most part of the third year of my abode here; for itis
to be observed, that in the interval of these things I had
my new harvest and husbandryto manage; for I reaped
'my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I
could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till
I had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to thrash it
on, or instrument to thrash it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay

much,- that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, '
and of the rice as much, or more; insomuch, that I now

' resolved to begin to 'use it freely, for 'my bread had been

quite gone 'a great while; also I (resolved .to see what
quantity would be sufficient for' me a whole year, and to

. sow-but once a'year.

-jii_Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of bar-
ley' and rice were jrnuch more than I could consume in a
year; so I resolved to' sow just the Same quantity every
year that I sowed the last, in hopes "that such a quantity

would fully provide me with bread, &c.

(All the while these things were doing, you may be sure
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land
which I had seen from the other side of the island; and
I was not without secret wishes that I was on shore there,
fancying that, seeing the mainland and an inhabited
country, I might find some way'or other to convey myself
farther; and, perhaps, at last find some means of escape.

But all this while>> I made no allowmce for the dangers
of such a condition,- and how I might fallinto the hands
of savages,"and, perhaps, .such as I might have reason to
think far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa--that,
if I once came intotheir power, I should run a hazard
more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps,
of being eaten; for I had heard that the>> people of the
Carribean coasts were cannibals", or men-eaters; and I
knew by the latitude that I could not be far off from that
shore--that, supposethey were not cannibals, yet they
might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into
their hands had been served, even when they had been
ten 6r twenty together; much. more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. 'All these things, I
say, which I'ought to 'have considered well of, and I did
cast up in'my thoughtsafterwards,'yet took none of my
apprehensions at first:' and my head ran mightily upon
the thoughts of getting _-ove_r' to that shore.

Now I wished for my bOy Xury, and the long-boat with
the shoulder-of-'mutton sail, with which I sailed above
a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but thiswas in'WT"";TIPW"V"1-"m" , < . .7 7- v-T, ----u., in". >-,,_--, 1--- Y 7566');

vain. Then I thought I would go and look on Our
ship's boat, which, as g1 have said, was blown up upon
thep shore a great way in the storm, when we were first
cast away She lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite, and was turned by the force of the waves and the'
winds almiost bottom upwards, against the high ridge 'of
a beachy rough sand, but no water about herg as before;

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done'
very well, and I might have gone back into the Brazils'
with her easy enough; but I might have easily foreseen
that I could no more turn her, and set her upright upon
her bottom, than I could remove the island. However, I
went to the wood, and out levers and rollers, and brought
them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do; sug-
gesting to my self, that if I could but turn her down, I
might easily repair the damage she had received, and she
would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea inher
very easily.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil,
and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it; at last,
finding it impossible to heave it up with my little strength,
I fell to the digging away the sand to undermine it, and
so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust
and guide it rig ht 1n the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up
again, or to get under it, much less to move it forwards
towards the water; so I was forced to give it over: and
yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire
to venture ever for the main increased, rather than de-
creased, as the means for it seemed impossible.

_Th1$ at' length set me upon thinking whether it was
not possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as
the'natives' of those climates make, even without tools,
or, as I might say,-without'hands, namely, of the trunk
of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but
easy; and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of
making it, and with having much more convenience for
it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at all conl
sidering the particular inconveniences which I lay under

'more- than the Indians did, namely, want of hands to
move it into the water'when it was made--a difficulty 1
much harder. for me to surmount than all the conse-
quences of want of tools could be to them: for what was
it to me that, when I had chosen a vast tree' in the woods,
I mig ht with great trouble cut it down, if after I might
be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into
the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the in-
side to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it--if,
after all this, I must leave it just there where I found it,

, and was not able to launch it into the water ?

One would have thought, I could not have had the
- least reflection upon my mind of my circumstances, while

I was making this boat, but I should have immediately
thought how I should get it into the sea; but my thoughts
were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I
never once considered how 'I should get it off the land:
and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to
guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five
fathoms of land, where it 1a , to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this cat the most like a fool that
ever man did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased
myself with'the design, without determining whether I
was ever able to undertake it; not but that the difliculty
of launching my boat came often into my head; but I
put a stop to my own inquiries mto it by this foolish an-
swer which I gave myself :---Let me first make it, Ill
warrant I'll find some way or other to get it along when
it' 1s done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eager-
ness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a
cedar tree--I question much whether Solomon ever had
such a one for the building the temple at Jerusalem. It
was five feet ten inches diameter at the 'lower part next
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at. the

, end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for a while,
and then parted into branches It was not without m-
finite labour that I felled this tree: I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen
more getting the branches and limbs, and the vastBUIL'DB A CANOE, BUT CANNOT LAUNCH IT. 121

spreading head of it, cut off, which I hacked and hewed
through with my axe and.hatchet with inexpressible la-
bour; after this it cost me a month to sha'p e it, and dub
it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a
boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It
cost me near three months more to clear the inside, and
work it out so as to make an exact boat of it: this I did'
indeed without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by
the dint of hard labour, tillI had brought it to be a very
handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six-
and- -twenty men, and consequently big enough to have
carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with igt: the boat.8 was really much bigger than
I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one
tree in my life; many a weary stroke it had cost, you may
be sure, for there remained nothing but to get it into the
water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no
question but I should have begun the maddest voyage,
and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was un-
dertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me,
though they ycost infinite labour too. It lay about one
hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the
first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek.
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig
into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this
I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains; but
who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view?
but when this was worked through, and this diificulty
managed, it was still much at one, for I could no more
stir the canoe than I could the other boat.

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved
to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the Water up to the canoe,
seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water:
well, I beg an this work, and when I beg an to enter into
it, and calculated how deep it was to beg dug, how broad,
how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found that, by the
number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must
have been ten or twelve years before I should have gone

thr'du'gh' with it_';' for the shore lay high, so that at the
upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep;
so at length, though 'with great reluctance, I gave this
attempt over also. '
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late; the folly of beginning a work before we count the
' cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength to
go through with it. '

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year
in this place, and kept my anniversary with the same de-

' votion', and with as much comfort, as ever before; for,
by a constant study, and serious application of the mini
of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a
different lmowledge from what I had before: I enter-
tained different notions of things; I looked now upon the
World as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with,
no expectation' from, and indeed no desires about: in a
word, I had nothing indeed, to do with it,_nor was ever
like to have; so I thought it looked, as we may. perhaps
look upon it hereafter, namely, as a place I had lived in,
'but wascome out of it; and wellI might say, as father
Abraham to Dives, '" Between me and thee'there is a great
gulf fixed." . -v- , "

In the first place, I was removed from all the wicked-
n'ess'of the world here. I had neither the lust of the
flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life. Ihad no--
thing to covet, for I had all I' was now capable of enjoy-
ing; '1 was lord of the whole manor, or,,if I pleased, I
might call myself king or emperor over the whole'country'
which I had possession of: there were no rivals; I had

. no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command .
with me; .I might have raised ship-loadings 'of corn, but '

I had no use for'it, so I let as little grow as I thought

enough for my dccasion ;' I had tortoises or turtles enough,"

but now' and then one was as much as I could put'to any

use; I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships;

I had grapes enough to have made wine,~or to have cured

gito raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been
uilt. '

But all I could make use Of. was all that was valuable;."nnrnsc'rrons on are donnrrioa.' ' " ' 123

' L-had enough to 'eat', and to supply my wants, and what
was all the rest to me ? If I ~killed more flesh than I
.could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin; if I sowed
more com than I could eat, it must be spoiled. The trees
that I cut down were lying torot on the ground, I could
make no more use of them than for fuel--and that I had
no occasion for but to dress my food. '

In a word, the nature and experience of things dic-
tated to me, upon just reflection, that allthe good things
of this world are no further good to us than as they are
for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up to give
to others, we enjoy only as much as we can use, and no
more. The most covetous griping miser in the world
would have been cured of the vice of_ covetousness, if he
had been in my case ; [for I ossessed infinitely more than
I knew what to do with. Ihad no' room for desire, ex-
cept it was of things which I had not, and they were but
trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as I
hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling: alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stufi' lay; I had no manner of business for
it; and I often thought with myself, that I would have
given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a
handmill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it
all for sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of
England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle
of ink: as it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or
benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew
mouldy with the damp of the cave; in the wet season;
and if I had had the drawerfull of diamonds, it had been
the same case, and they had been of no manner of value
to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier
in itself than it was at first, and much easier to my mind
as well as to my body. I frequently sat down to my meat
with thankfulness, and admired the hand of God's pro-
vidence, which had thus spread my table in the wilder-
ne'ss. ' I learnt to look more upon the bright side of my
condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider
what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted--'and this gave
- 124 mm AND anvnnrunns or- ROBINSON causes.

me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot ex-
press them~--and which I take notice of here, to put those
discontentedfieople in mind of it, who cannot enjoy com-
fortably what God hath given them, because they see and

_ covet something that he has not given them: all our dis-
contents about what we want, appeared to me to spring
from the want of thankfulpess for what we have:

Another reflection was of great use to me, and, doubt-
less, would be so to any one that should fall into such
distress as mine was; and this was,vto compare my pre-
sent condition with what I at first expected it should be
---nay, with what it would certainly have been-<<if the
good providence of God had not wonderquy ordered the
ship to be cast up near to the shore, where I not only
could come at her,-but could bring what -I got out of her
to the shore for my relief and comfort; without which I-
had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, or gun- ,
powder and shot for getting my food. '

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in repre-
senting to myself, in the, most lively colours, how I must
have acted if I had got nothing out of the ship; how I
could not have so much as got any food, except fish and
turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of
them, I must have perished first--that I should have lived,
if I had not perished, like amera savage--that if I had
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way
to flay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin and
the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my
teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.

- These reflections made me very' sensible of the good-

ness of Providence to me, and very thankful for my pre-
sent condition, with all its hardships and misfortunes;
and this part also I cannot but recommend to the reflec-
tion of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, " Is
any affliction like mine ? " Let them consider how much
worse the cases of some people are, and what their case
might have been, if Providence had thoughtfit.

I had another reflection. which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was, comparing

-' . I had lived a dreadful life, pyerfectl destitute of the know-
ledge and fear of God. I had been well instructed by
father and mother; neither had they been wanting to me
in their early endeavours to infuse a religious awe of God
into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the nature
and end of my being required of me. But, alas! falling
early into the seafaring life, which, of all lives, 13 the
most destitute of the fear of God, though his tenors are
always before them--I say, falling early into the sea-
faring life, and into seafaring company, all that little
sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out
of me by my messmates--by a hardened despising of dan-
gers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me
--by my long absence from all manner of opportunities
to converse with anything but what was like myself, or '
to hear anything of what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of everything that was good, or of the
least sense of what I was, or was to be, that In the great-
est deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape fi'om Sallee,
my being taken up by the Portuguese master of the ship,
my being planted so well In Brazil, my receiving the .
cargo from Eng land, and the like, I never once had the

my mouth, nor, in the greatest distress, had I so much
thought as to pray to him, nor as much as to say, " Lord,
have mercy upon me! "--no, not to mention the name
of God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it. '
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already Observed, on the account of
my wicked and hardenedy life p;ast and when I looked
, about me, and considered what particular providences
, had attended me, since my coming into this place, and
, how God had dealt bountifully with me--had not only
punished me less than my iniquity deserved, but had so

I had no reason to have expected in that place--that I

I could have been cast more to my advantage--a place
where, as I had no society, which was my afiliction on
one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious
1 wolves, or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous crea-
tures or poisonous, which I might have fed on to my
hurt; no savages to murder and devour me ' ,

In aword, as my life was alife of sorrow one way, so
it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to
make it a life of. comfort; but to be. able to make my sense
of God's goodness to me, and care over me in this con-
dition, be my daily consolation; and after I made a just
improvement of these things, I went away, and was no
more sad . i, '

I had now been here so long, that many things which
I brought on shore for my help were either quite gone or

very much wasted, and near spent, .'L

My ink, as I observed, had been, gone for some time,
all but a very little, which I eked but with water a little
and a little, till it was so pale it scares left any appearance
of black upon the paper,- as long as it _lasted, I made use
of it to minute down the day s of the month on which any
remarkable thing ha ppenedy to me, and first, by casting
up times past, I remember that there was a. strange con-
currence of days 1n the various providences which befell
me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to -
observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had
reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

'away fiom my father and my friends, and ran away to
Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards I
(was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave.

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the

' wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day of
the year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in
the boat.

The same day of the year I was bern on, namely, the
20th of September, they same day I had my life so mixa-
culously saved twenty-six years after, When I was cast
on shore in this island; so that my wicked life, and soli-
tary life, both began on a day.

_ The next thing to my ink' s being wasted, was that of

? my bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought cut of the

E- ship. This I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing

3 \ myself but one cake of bread a- day, for above a year: and

yet I was quite without bread for a year before I got any
corn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that I hady any at all, the getting it being, as it has been

1 already observed, next to miraculous.

" My clothes, too, began to decay mightily. as to linen, I

had none a goodwhile, except some chequered shirts which

I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I

carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no

.other clothes on but a shirt, and it was a very great help

to me that I had, among all the men' s clothes of the ship,

almost three dozen shirts. There were also several thick
match-coats of the seamen, which were left behind, but

,weather was so Violently hot that. there was no need of

.clothes,y at I could not go quite naked--no, though I had

been inclined to it, which I was not--nor couldg I abide

the thOughts of it, though I was all alone.

One reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could
[not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as
with some clothes on--nay, the very heat frequently

blistered my. skin; whereas, with a shirt on, the. air itself

;made some motion and whistling under the shirt, was

twofold cooler than Without it: nq more couldI ever bring

a hat; the heat of the sun beating with such violence as

it does in that place, would give me the headache pre-

sently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap

or hat On, so that I could not bear it; whereas if I put
on my hat, it would presently go away.

Up on these views I began to cOnsider about putting '

the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some
order; I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my
business was now to try if I could not make] ackets out
Of the great watch- coats which I had by me, and with
such other materials as I had--so I set to work a- tailor-
ing, or rather, indeed, a- botching--for I made most
piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make two
or three waistcoats, which I hop ed would serve me a
great while. as for breeches or drawers, I made but very
sorry shift indeed till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
- creatures that I killed--I mean four-footed ones--and I
had hung them up stretched out with sticksin the sun ,
by which means some Of them were so dry and hard that
they were fit for little; but others, it seems, were very

useful. The first thing I made of these was a great cap '
for my head, with the ghair on the outside to shoot off '

the raini~ and this I performed so well, that after this I
made a suit of clothes wholly Of those skins--that 18 to
say, a waistcoat and breeches open at the knees, and both
loose, for they were rather wanted to keep me codl, than
to keep me warm. I must not Omit to acknowledge, that
, they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
31 was aWorse tailor: hOwever, they- were such as I made
a very good shift with; and when Iwas abroad, if it hap -
'pened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being

outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this, I spent a deal Of time and pains to make

me an umbrella. PI was, indeed, in great want of one, and
had a great mind to make one: Ih'ad seen them made 1n
- the Brazils, where they are very usefulin the great heats

'j '4' thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took

a world of pains at it, and was a great while before I
could make anything likely to hold, nay, after I thought '
I had hit the way ,I spoiled two or three before I made
one to my mind; but 1;: last I made one that answered _
indifl'erently well. The main difiiculty I found Was toe
make it to let down: I could make it to spread; but if it
did not let down too, and draw :11, it would not be port-
able for me any way, but just over my head, which would
not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to an-
swer: I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that
it cast ofi' the rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun
so effectually, that I could walk out' in the hottest of the
weather, with greater advantage than I could before in
the coolest; and, when I had no need of it, I could close;
it, and carry- it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being en-
tirely composed by resigning gto thewill of God, and throw-
ing myself wholly upon the disposal of his providence:
this made my lifey better than sociable, for, when Ibeg an
to regret they want of conversation, I would ask myself,
whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts,
and, as I hope I may say, with even my Maker, by ejacu-

, lations and petitions, was not better than the utmost en-

joyment of human society 1n the world. \

I cannot say, that, after this, for five years, any extra-
ordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on in the
same course, in the same posture and place, just as before.
The chief thing I was employed in, besides my yearly
labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my
raisins, of both whichy I always kept up just enough to
have a suficient stock of the year' s provisions beforehand
e--I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour
of going out with mygun ,I had one labour to makeg me
a canoe, which at last I finished: so that by diggm ,
canal to it, six feet wide, and four feet deep, I broug hgt it
into the creek almost half a mile. As for the first, that .
was so vastly big' g, as I made it without considering be-.;
forehand,r_ as I ought to'do; how I should 'be able to,

launch it; so, never being able to bring it to the water,,-

I .
or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where
it was, as a memorandum to teachg me to be wiser next
time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not get a
tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not
get the water to it, at any less distance than, as I have
said, of near half a mile, yet, as I saw it practicable at
last I never gave it over; and, though I was near two
years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, 1n hopes
of having a boat to go 011' to sea at last. '

 

CHAPTER X.

HOWEVER, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which

I had in view when I made the firsts--I mean of ventur-,

ing over to the terra firma, where it was above forty
miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of the boat as-
sisted to put an end to that design ,and now I thought

no more of it. But as I had a boat, my next design was _ '

to make a tour round the island: for, as I had been on

the other side, in one place, crossing, as I have already.
described-it, over the land, so the discoveries I made 1n .

that Journey made me very eager to see the other parts
of the coast; and nowI had a boat, Ithought of nothmg
but sailing round the island. .

For this purpose, and that I might do everything with

discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to.
my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces.

ofy the ship' 8 sails, which layin store, and Of which Ihad
a great store by me. '
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I

found she would sail very well. Then I made little'~

lockers and boxes at each end of my boat, to put provi-
sions, necessaries, and ammunition, &c., into, to be. kep t
dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea, and a little
long hollow place I cut 1n the inside of the boat, where

I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it -

to keep 1t dry. .

I fixed my umbrella also in a. ste at the stern, like a
mast, to stand over "my head, and esp the heat of the
sun all me, like an awning; and thus I every now and
then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never went
far out, nor far from the little creek; but at last, being
eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I
resolved upon my tour, and accordinglyI victualled my
ship .for the voyage--putting in two dozen of my loaves
(cakes I should rather call them) of barley-bread, an
earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great deal
of), a little bottom of rum, half a goat, and powder and
shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those
which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the'
seamen's chests: these I took, one to lie upon, and. the
other to cover me in the night,

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I set out
on this voyage, and I found it much longer than I ex-
pected; for though the island itself was not very large,
yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge
of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above
water, some under it; and beyond this a. shoal of sand,
lying dry half a league more; so that I was obliged to go
a great way out to sea to double that point.

When Ifirst discovered them, I was going to give over
my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how
far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all,
doubting how I should get back again; so I came to an
anchor, for I had made me a kind of an anchor with a
piece of broken grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on
shore, climbing up a bill, which seemed to overlook that
point, where I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to

venture.

In my viewing the sea'from that hill where I stood, I
perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current
which ran to the east, and even came close to the point;
and Itook the more notice of it, becauseI saw there might
be some danger, that when I came into it, I might be

carried out to sea by the strength ofit, and not be able
to make the island again. And'indeed, hadI not gotten
first upon this hill, I believe it would have 'been so; for
there was the same current on the other side of the
island, only that it set off at a farther distance ; and I saw
there was a strong eddy under the shore--so I had no-
thing to do but to get out of the first current, and I should
presentl be in an eddy. . v

I lay- ere, however, two days; because the wind blow-
ing pretty fresh (at east-south-east, and that being just
contraryto the said current), made a great breach of the
sea . upon- the point; so that it was not safe for me to
keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far
off because of the stream.

The third dayin the morning, the wind having abated
overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured: but I am
awarning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for
no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not my
boat's length from the shore, but I found myselfin a great
depth of water and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it, with such a violence that
all I could do could not keep her so much as on the edge
of it: but I found 'it hurried me farther and farther out
from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There was
no wind stirringto help me, and all that I could do with
my paddles signified nothing; andnow I began to give
myself over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides
of the island, I knew in a few leagues? distance they must
.1 join again, and then I. was irrecoverably gone--nor did
I-vsee any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no
prospect before me but of perishing--not by the sea, for
that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. Ihad,
indeed, found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I
could lift, and had tossed it into the boat ; and Ihad a great
jar of fresh water, that is to. say, one of my earthen pets;
but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean,
where, to be sure, there was no shore, no mainland, or
island, for a thousand leagues at least '2 '

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of
God to make the most miserable condition that mankind
could be in worse. Now, I looked back upon my dead-;, :sz .'

DRIVEN our re am. 133

late solitary island as the most pleasant place in the
world,and all the happiness myheart could wish for was
to'be there again: I stretched out my hands to it with
eagerwishes. " Oh, happy desert! " said I, " I shall never
see thee more! Oh, miserable'creaturel " said I, "whither
am I going? " Then I reproached myself with my un-
thankful temper, and how I had repined at my solitary
condition; and now, what would I give to be on shore
there again? Thus we never see the true state of our
condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor
know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was
in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared
to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues,
and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again:
however, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was al-
most exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the north-
ward, that is, towards the side of the current which the
eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze
of wind in my face, springing up from the south-south-
east. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when,
in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle
gale. By this time I was gotten at a frightful distance
from the island; and, had the least cloud or hazy weather
intervened, I had been undone another way too ; for I had
no compass on board, and should never have known how
to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost
sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied
myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, stand-
ing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of
the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began
to stretch away, I saw, even by the cleamess of the water,
some alteration of the current was near; for where the
current was so strong, the water was foul: but perceiving
the water clear, I found the current abate, and presently

'I found, to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the
sea upon some rocks: these 'rocks I found caused the
current to part again; and as themain stress of it ran
away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east,
so the other returned by the repulse of the rock, and made
a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west
with a very sharp stream.

They 'who know what it is to have a reprieve brought
to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves
just going to murder them,- Or whohavebeen in such like
extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy
Was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of
this eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I
spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind,
and with a strong tide or eddy under foot. .

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back '
again directly towards the island, but about two leagues
more towards the northward than the current lay, which

' carried me away at first; so that when I came near the
island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it,
that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to that
which I went out from. .

When I had made something more than a league of
way, by the help of this heavy current or eddy, I found it
was spent, and served me no farther. However, I found,
thatbeing between the two great currents, namely, that
on the south side which had hurried me away, and that
on the north, which day about two leagues on the other
side--I say, between these two, in the west of the island,
I found the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steer-
ing directly for the island, though not making such fresh
way as I did before. '

- After four o'clock in the evening, being then within
about a league of the island, I found the point of the
rocks which occasioned this distance stretching out, as is
described before, to the southward, and, casting ofi' the
current more s'outhwardly, had, of course, made another
eddy to' the north; and this I found very strong, but not
directly setting the way my course lay, which was due
West, but almost full north. However, having a fresh
gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west,
and, in about an hour, came within about a mile of theBEACHES TEE SHORE AFTER GREAT DIFFIGULTY. 135

_ When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all
thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and, refreshing
myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat close
to the shore, in a little cove that I had espied under some

'trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite Spent with
the labour and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with .
my boat; I had run so much'hazard, and knew too much
the cause, to think of attempting it by the way I went
out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the
west side), I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any
more ventures ; so I only resolved in the morning to make
my way westward along the shore, and to see if there was
no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as -
to have her again if I wanted her. In about three miles,

. or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good,
inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it
came to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a
convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if
she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her:
here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, 1
went on shore to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been before when I travelled on foot to that
shore; so, taking nothing>> out of my boat; but my gun

, and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began my
march. The way was comfortable enough, after such a
voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower
in the evening, where I found everything standing as I
left it; for I always kept in good order, being, as Ilsaid
before, my country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to

. rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but

judge if you can, you that read my story, what a surprise
I must be in,- when I was awaked out of my sleep. by a
voice calling me by my name several times, "Robin,
Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe: Where are,
136.1.Ira PSND'1DVENTURES ornosmson causes.

,_ 011, Robin Crusoe ? 'Where are you ? Where have you

een ? " y
I was dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing,

or paddling, as it' 1s called, the first part of the day, and
walking the latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly;

and dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I
dreamed that somebody spoke to me; butg as the voice
continued to repeat," Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe! " at
last I beg an to awake more perfectly, and was at first
V dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost con-
sternation: but no sooner were my eyes open, but I
saw my Poll sitting on the top of the yhed ge, and im-

mediately knew that this was he that spokeg to me; for

just m such bemoaning language I had used to talk to
him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly,
that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his biJl close
to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe, where are you ?
Where have you been? How came you here?" and
such things as I taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while
before I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how
the creature got thither, and then how he should just
keep about the place, {and nowhere else: but as I was
well satisfied it could _be nobody but honest Po]1,I got
it over; and, holding out my hind, and calling him gby
his name, " Poll I " the sociable creature came to me, and
sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued
talking to me--"Poor Robin Crusoe l" and " How did .,
I come here ?" and "Where had I been?" just as if he
had been overjoyed to seems again; and so I carried
him home along with me.

Ihad now had enough of rambling to sea for some time,
and had enough to do for many days to sit still and re-
fleet up on the dang er I had been m. I would have been

glad to have had my boat again on my side of the .
island, but I knew not how it was practicable to get it
about: as to' the east side of the island, which I had gone
round, I knew well enough there was no venturing that
Way; my very heart would shrink, and my very blood run

chill, but to think of it: andas to the other side of the
island, I did not know how it might be there, but sup-

mgthe current ran with the same force against the
shore at the east, as it passed by it on the other, Imight
run the same risk of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as I had been before of being car-
ried away from it. So with these thong hts I contented
my self to be without any boat, thong hg it had been the
product of so many months' labour tgo make it, and of
so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a
year--lived a very sedate retired life, as you may well
suppose, and my thoughts being very much composed as
to my condition, and fully comforted 1n resignm gnmg my self
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really
very happily 1n all things, except that of society..

I improved myself' m this time in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying my-
self to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have made a
ilverydgood carpenter, especially considering how few tools

ha .

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in
my earthenware, and contrivedwell enoug hto makethem
with a wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better ,
because I made thing s round and sha peable, which be-
fore were filthy thingsg indeed to look on. But I think I
never was more vain of my own performance, or more
joyful for anything I found out, than for my being able'
to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a very ng 1y
clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red like

' other earthenware, yet as it was hard yand firm, and

would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with
it-----for I had been always used to smoke; and there were
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing

there was tobacco' in the island; and afterwards, when

. I searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes

at all.
In my wickerware I also improved much, and made

' abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention

showed me, though not very handsome, yet convenient
for my laying things'up in, or fetching things home in.
For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up
in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and
bring it home in a basket: and the like by a turtle; I
could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of
the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home
in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large
deep baskets were my receivers for my corn, which I
always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and
kept it in great baskets instead of a granary.

I began now to perceive my powder abated consider-
ably; and this was a want which it was impossible for
me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what I
must do when I should have no more powder--that is to
say, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as I ob-
served, in the third year of my being here, kept a young
kid, and bred her tame; I was in hopes of getting a he-
kid, but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till
my kid grew an old goat; and I could never find in my
heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere age.

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence,
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set
myself to study some art to trap and snare the goats, to
see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and,
particularly, I wished to possess a she-goat great with
young. 3,

To this purpose I made snares to hamper them, and
believe they were more than once taken in them; but my
tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and always found
them broken, and my bait devoured. _

At length I resolved to try a pitfall; so I dug several
large pits in the earth, in places where I had observed
the goats used to feed, and over these pits I placed hur-
dles, of my own 'making too, with a great weight upon
them; and several times I put ears of barley, and dry rice,
without setting the trap; and I could easily perceive that
the goats had gone in,.and eaten up the corn, for I could
see the marks of their feet: at length, I set three traps
in one night, and going the next morning, I found them
all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This wasOATGHES A com AND 11mm ms Iii A TRAP. 189

very discouraging; however, I altered my trap ;' and, not
to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see
my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-goat;
and in one of the other, three kids, a male, and two
females.

' As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him;
he was so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him--
that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which
was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that
was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I
even let him out, and he ran away as if he had been
frightened out of his wits; but_I did not then know what
I afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a lion: if
I had let him stay there three or four days without food,
and then have carried him some water to drink, and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the
kids; for they are mighty sagacious and tractable crea-
tures, where they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time: then I went to the three kids; and,
taking them one by one, I tied them with strings together,
and with considerable difficulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throw-
ing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they
began to be tame: and now I found that if I expected to
supply myself with goat's flesh, when I had no powder
or shot left, breeding up some tame was my only Way,
when, perhaps, I might have them about my house like
a flock of sheep.

But then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep
the tame from the wild, or else they would always run
wild when they grew up; and the only way for this was
to have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced,
either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually
that those within might not break out, or those without
break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I saw therewas an absolute necessity for doing it,
my first piece of work was to find out a proper piece of
ground, namely, where there was likely to be herbage
for them to eat, water for them to'drink, and e0v'er to
keep them from the sun. '

Those who understand such enclosures will think I
had very little contrivance when I pitched upon a place
very proper for all these (being a plain open piece of
meadowland, or savanna, as our people call it in the
western colonies), which had two or three little drills of
fresh water in it; and at one end was very woody--I say,
they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I
began by enclosing of this piece of ground in such a man-
ner that my hedge or pale must have been at least two
miles about : nor was the madness of it so great as to the
compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have
time enough to do it in; but I did not consider, that my
my goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they
had had the whole island ; and I should have so much
room to chase them in, that I should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about
fifty yards when this thought occurred to me; so I pre-
sently stopped short, and for the first beginning I re-
solved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty
yards in length, and a hundred yards in breadth, which,
as it would: maintain as many as I should have in any
reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, I could add
more ground to my enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, andI went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the
first piece; and till I had done it, I tethered the three kids
in the best part of it, and used them to feed as near meas
possible, to make them familiar; and very often I would
go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of
rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after my en-
closure was finished, and I let them loose, they would fol-
low me up and down, .bleating after me for a handful of
corn. .

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half

'I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in
two years more I had three-and-forty, besides several
that I took and killed for my food; and after that I en-
closed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, withwins>>

little pens to drive them, into, to take them as I wanted
them, and gates out of one piece of ground into another;

But this was not all; for now I not only had got goat's
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing
which indeed' in m ybeginning I did not so much as think
of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, was really
an agreeable surprise; for now I set up my dairy, and
had sometirhes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And
as nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature,
dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so I, that
never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw butter or
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both but-
ter and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.

How merciquy can our great Creator treat his crea-
tures, even in those conditions in which they seem to be
overwhelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten the
bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise him
for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here spread
for me, in a wilderness where I saw nothing at first but
to perish for hunger!

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me
and my little family sit down to dinner: there was my

_ majesty, the prince yand lord of the whole island, I had

theJ lives of all _my subjects at absolute command, I could
hang, draw, give life and liberty and take it away, and
no rebels among all my subjects.

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, at- -
tended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my
favourite,.was the only person permitted to talk to me ;
my dog, which was now grown .very old and crazy, and
found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always
at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side the table,
and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from
my hand, as a mark of special favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on

shore at first; for they were both of them dead, and had

been interred near my habitation with my own hands ,
but one of them having multiplied by I know not what
kind of creature. these were two which I preserved tame,
whereas the rest ran wild into the woods, and became,
indeed, troublesome to me at last; for they would often
come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I
was eblig ed to shoot them, and did kill a great many:

at length they left me. With this attendance, and in
this plentifuly manner, I lived; neither could I be said to
want anything but society, and of that, in some time
after this, I was like to have too much.

 

CHAPTER XI.

I was somewhat impatient, as I had observed, to have the
use of my boat, though very loath to run any more
hazard; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways
to get her about the island, and at other times I sat my-
self down contented enough without her. But I had a
strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point
of the island, where, as I have said in my last ramble, I
went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might seewhat I had to do. This' 1n-
clination increased upon me every day, and at length I
resolved to travel thither by land, and following the edge
of the shore,I did so; but had any one in England been
to meet such a man as I was, it must either have fright-
ened him, or raised a great deal of laug hter; and as I
frequently stood still to look at my self, I could not but
smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire
with such an equipage, and' m such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my fi gun, as follows:--

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's skin,
with a flap hangm gdown behind, as well to keep the
sun from me as to Wshoot the rain off from rtmning into
my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these climates as
the rain up on the flesh gunder the clothes.

I had a thOI't jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle 8of my thighs; and a pair of
op en-kneed breeches of the same: ythe breeches were I)made
of the skin of an old he- -goat, whose hair hung down suchnnscnmrros or me press. 143

a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached
to the middle of my legs Stockings and shoes I had
none; but I had madegs me a pair of something, I scarce
knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my
legs ,and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of a
most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my
clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew tog ether with two thongs of the same, instead of
bucklest;g and' in a kind of a frog on either side of this,
instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a
hatchet--one on one side, one on the other; I had an-
other belt not so broad, and fastened in the same man-
ner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end of it,
underm my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of
goat's skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the
other my shot: at my back I carried my basket, on my
shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy ugly
goat's skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most
necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As
for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-
like as one might expect from a man not at all careful of
it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox.
My beard I had once sufi'ered to grow till it was about a.
quarter of a yard long g; but as I had both scissors and
razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what
grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into alarge :-
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn
by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did
not wear such, thou ghtlieTurks did; of these mustachios,
or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough tohang
my hat upon them; but they were of length and shape
monstrous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I had
so few to observe, that it was of no manner of conse-
quence--so I say no more to that p.art In this kind of

figure I went my new journey, and was out five or six
days. Itravelled first along the sea-shore directly to the
place where I first broughtg my boat to an anchor, to get
upon the rocks; and, having no boat now to take care
of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the same height
that I was upon before; when looking forward to the
point of the rock which lay out, and which I was to double
with my'boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see'the
sea all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no
current, any more than" 1n any other p.1aces

I was at a strange loss to understandp this, and resolved
to spend some time in the observing of it, .to see if no.
thing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it: but I
was presently convinced how it was; namely, that the
' tide of ebb Betting fi'om the west, and joining with the
current of waters from some great river on the shore,
must be the occasion of this current, and aceordinglyas
the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the
north, this current came near, or went farther from the
shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up
to the rock again, and then, the tide of ebb being made,
I plainly saw the current again as before, only gthat it
ran farther ofi', being near half a league from. the shore ,
whereas, in my case, it set close upon the shore, and
hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at another
time it would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to
do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide,
and I might very easily bring my boat about the island
again: but when I beg an to think of putting it into
practice, I had such a terror up on myp sp irits at the re-
membrance of the danger I hadp been in, that I could not
think of it again with any patience; but,'bn the con-

, I took up another resolution, which'was more safe,
though more laborious ; and this was, that I would build,
or rather make, me another periagua, or canoe; and so
have one for one side of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call
it, two plantations in the island, one my little fortifica-
tion, or tent, with the wall about it under the rock, with
the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged
into several apartments or eaves, one within another
One of these which was the driest and largest, and hadbeyond where my wall joined to the rock--was all filled
up with large earthen pots, of which I have given an
_' account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which
.:' would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my
. stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear
out 01f short from the straw, and the other rubbed out-
with my hands.
As for my wall, made as before with long stakes or
piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time

. grown so big, and spread so very much, thaty there was

' '. not the least appearance, to any one' 3 view, of anyhabi-

= . iation behind them. .

-. N ear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within
the land, and up on lower ground, lay ymy two pieces of
corn ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and

, which duly yielded me their harvest in its season: and
whenever I had occasion for more com, I had more land
adjoining, as fit as that.

_ Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a
tolerable plantation there also; for first, I had my little

' bower, as I' called it, which I kept in repair--that is to

'" say, I kept the hedge which circled it in Constantly fitted

up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the

inside; I kept the trees, which at first were no m01e than
stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall--I kept
1 them always so cut that they might spread, andgr
thick and wild, and make the more mlgagreeable shade, which

I they did efi'ectually to my mind. In the middle of this

I had my tent always standing, being a piece of sail spread

over poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted

, any repair or renewing; and under this I had made me a

_ squab, or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had

; killed, and with other soft things, and a. blanket laid on

1 them, such as belonged to our sea bedding, which I had

saved, and a 'great'watch-coat to cover me; and here,

whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat,

'_ I took up my country habitation.

,- . :- Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my cattle,

; that is to say, my'goats: and as I had taken an incon

7' ceivable deal of pains to fence and enclosethis ground, I '

a was so uneasy to see it kept entire,vlest the goats should
break through, that I never left ofi, till, with infinite

labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of .

small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was
rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to
put a hand through between them, which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy
season, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed,
stronger than any wall.

" This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared n'o pains to bring to pass whatever appeared ne-
cessary for my comfortable support; for I considered the
keeping up a breed 'of tame creatures thus at my hand,
would be a living magazine of- flesh, milk, butter, and
cheese for me, as long as I lived in the place, if it were
to be forty years; and that keeping them in my reach
depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to
such a- degree that I might be sure of keeping them to-
gether; which by this method, indeed, I so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I
had planted them to very thick I was forced to pull some
. of them up again.

- In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I
principally depended on for my winter store of raisins,

and which I never failed to preserve very carefully, as '

the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and,

, indeed, they were not agreeable only, but physical, whole-

some, nourishing, and refreshing, to the last degree.
As this was also about half way between my other

habitation and the place where I had laid up the boat; I '

generally staid and lay here on my way thither; for I
used frequently to visit myboat, and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order. Sometimes
\I went out in her to divert myself; but no more hazardous
voyages would I go, nor scarce ever'above a stone's cast
or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being
hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents, or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new
' . scene of my life.: It happened one' day about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of aman' s
naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen
. ' in the sand: I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if Ihad
j seen an apparition; I listened, I looked round me---I
' feould hear nothing, nor see anything: I went up to a
2 rising ground to look farther; I went up the shore and
, down the shore, but it was all one, I could see no other
impression but that one ; I went to it again to see if there
' were any more, and to observeif it might not be my fancy;
but there was no room for that, for there was exactly the
very print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot;
how it came thither I knew not, nor could m the least
imagine. .1; But after innumerable fluttering thoughts,'
like a man perfectly confused, and out of my self, I came _
V, home to my fortification, not feeling ,aswe say, the ground
" I went on, ybut terrified to the last3 degree, looking behind
me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bgush and .
tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to rybe a man ;
7- nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes
an aflrighted imagination represented things to me inae
. how many wild ideas were formed every moment in my
' fancy--and what strange unaccountable whimsies came
into my thoughts by the way
4 When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it
, ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued, whether I
' went over by the ladder, at first contrived, or' went in at
i the hole in the rock, which I called a door, I cannot re-
? member; for never frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to
, earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.
,3 I: had no sleep that nig:ht the farther I was from the
occasion of my fri g,ht the greater my apprehensions were ,
a which is something contrary to the nature of such things, '
- and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in
feariE But I was So embarrassed with my 'own frightful
' ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal
imaginations to myself, even though I was now a great
way 011' it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil;
and reason joined in with me upon this supposition.
For how should any other thing :11 human shape come

 

  

oasnavns A man's roorram'r ON THE enema 147 -1 :3 i
into the place ?- 'Where was the vessel that brought them ?
What .marks were there of any other footsteps? 'And
how was it possible that a man should come there '2 But
' then to think that Satan should take human shape upon
. him in such a place, where there could be no manner of
occasion for it but to leave the print of his foot behind
him, and that even for no purpose too (for he could not
be sure I should see it), this was an amazement the other
way. I considered that the devil might have found out
, abundance of other ways to have terrified me, than this
of the single print of a foot; that, as I lived quite on the
other side of the island, he would never have been so
simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten
thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and
in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon a
high wind would have defaced entirely. All this seemed
inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all notions v
we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil.
Abundance of such thing s as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I
presently concluded that it must be some more dangerous
creature--namely, that it must be some of the savages
of the mainland over against me, who had wandered out
to sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents,
or by contrary winds, had made the island? and had been
on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being as
loath, perhaps, to have staid in this desolate islandg, as
I would have been to have .had them. '-
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I
was very thankful 1n my thought, that Iwas so happ
not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they didp not
see my boat, by which they would have concluded that
some inhabitants had been 1n the place, and perhaps
have searched further for me. Then terrible thoughts

' ' racked my imagination, about their having found my

~boat, and that there were people here, and that if so, I '
should certainly have them come again in greater num-
bers, and devour me: that if it should happen so that .
they'should not find me, yet they would find my enclo-
sure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my flock of 'tame goats; and I should perish at last for mere_
want. i' H.115 -<< gingham =1", .

'uTh'us my fear banished 8.11 my religious hope; allthat
former confidence in God, which was founded upon such
wonderful experience as I had had of his goodness, now
vanished: as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto,
, could not preserve by his power the provision which he had
" made for me by his goodness. I reproached myself with
: my laziness, that I would not sow any more com one
;. year than would just serve me till the next season, as if
,; no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
crop that was upon the ground And this I thought so
just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have two
' or three years' corn beforehand, so that, whatever might
_' come, I might not perish for want of bread.

cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I called

among the rest of his creatures, that to have seen one
_' of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me
from death to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven
itself, next to the supreme grblessing of salvation, could
bestow--_I say, that I should now tremble at the very
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink
into the ground at but the shadow, or silent appearance,
of a man's having set his foot on the island.

me a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I
had a little recovered my first surprise: I considered that

providence of God had determined for me; that as I

could not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might
be in all this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty,
who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted right by
creation to govern and dispose of me-absolutely as he

. thought fit {and who, as I was a creature who had

offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn
me to what punishment he thought fit'; and that it was
my part to submit to bear his indignation, becauseI had
sinned' against him.

" I then reflected, that God, who was not only righteous,
but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and
afliict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he-did-
not think fit to do it, it was my unquestioned duty to
'resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will ; and, on
the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray
to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and directions
'of his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days--nay, I

~may say, weeks and months; and one particular effect

of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit ; namely,
one morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with
thoughts about my danger-from the appearance of sav-
ages, I found it disoomposed me very much; upon which

*those words of the Scripture came into my thoughts,

" Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me." << . , ' ,
Upon this, rising cheerquy out of my bed, my heart was
not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to
pray earnestly to God for deliverance. When I had done
praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the
first words that presented to me were, "Wait on the

' Lord, and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy

heart: wait, I say, on the Lor ." It is inipossible to ex-
press the comfort this gave me; and in return, I'thank-
_fully laid down the book, and was no more sad, at leas
on that occasion. -
- 'In the midst of these cogitations, apprehensions, and

' reflections, it came into. my thoughts one day, that all this .

might be a mere chimera of my own. that this foot mightrAims couaAGn r0 MEASURE rim roorpnmr. 151

my bogt. This cheered me up alittle too, and I began
persuade myself it was all a delusion-- that it was nothing
else but my own foot; and why might not I come that
way from my boat, as well as I wasg going that way to the -
~boat ? 'A gain, I considered also, that I could by no means
tell for certain where I had trod,- and where I had not;
and that if at last this was only the print of my own foot,
I had played the part of those fools who strive to make
stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are them-
selves frighted at them more than anybody else.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again
for I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and .
nights, so that I began to starve for provision ;' for I had.-
. little or nothing within doors, but some barley -cakes and
: water. I Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion--and the
poor creatures were in great pain and mconvenience for
want of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them,
and almost dried up their milk.

"1;-- Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief that this
was nothing but the print of one of my own feet and so
I might be truly said to start at my own shadow), beg an
to go abroad again, and went to my country houseto milk
my flock; but to see with what fear I went forward, how
often I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now
and then_ to lay down my basket, and run for my life, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunted with

an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly ,
frighted; and so indeed I had.

having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder,y and to
think there was really nothing m it but my own imagina-
tion; but I could not persuade myself fully of this, till I
should go down to the shore again and see this print of a
foot, and measure it by ymy own, and see if there was any
similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it was my
own foot.-' But when I came to the place first, it appeared
evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not
possibly be ashore anywhere thereabouts. Secondly,

be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore from ' '

as However, as I went down thus two or three day s, and - -
when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, 1
found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these
things filled my head wigth new imaginations, and gave
. me the vapours again to the highest degree; so that I
shook with cold like one in an ague, and I went home
again, filled with the belief that some man or men had
been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was
' inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware ,
and what course to take for my security I knew not.

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when pos-
sessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of those
means which reason ofi'ers for their relief. The first
thing I proposed to my self was, to throw down my enclo-
sures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods,
that the enemy might not find them, and then frequent
the island in prospect of the same,- or the like booty then
to the simple thing of digging up my two corn fields, that
they might not find such a grain there, and still be

_ prompted to frequent the island, then to demolish my
.bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of
my habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order
to yfind out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subjects of the first night's cogitation
after I was come home again, while the apprehensions
which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and
my head was full of vapours, as above. Thus, fear oi

' _ danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than dang er

itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden
of anxietygr eater by much than the evil which we are
anxious about. but, which was worse than all this, I had
not that relief" in this trouble, from the resignation I used
to practise, that I hop ed to have. I looked, I thought,
like Saul, who complained, not onl that the Philistines

did notp now take due ways to compose my mind, by cry-
ing to God in 'ym distress, and resting upon his provid-
ence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliver-
ance; which, if I had done, I had at least been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps
carried through it with more resolution.srnnnernnus ms rosrrrrclmon. ' >> 153 "
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
1 night; but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by
' the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, tired and
~ my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and awaked
fi- much better composed than Ihad ever been before. And
, now I began to think sedately; and, upon the utmost de-
__ bate with myself, I concluded, that this island, which was
7 so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the
mainland than as I had seen, was not so entirely aban-
-.-' doned as I might imagine: that although there were no
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there
,, V T: might sometimes come boats ofi from the shore, who,
"L either with design, or perhaps never but when they were
_, driven by cross winds, might come to this place: that I
had lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with
the least shadow or figure of any people before; and that,
3 if at any time they should be'driven here, it was probable
they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing
PI they had never thought fit to fix there upon any occasion,
to this time: that the most I could suggest any danger
from, was .from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely,'if
they were driven hither, were here against their wills; so
they made no stay here, but went 01f again with all pos-
sible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they -
should not have the help of the tides and daylight back
again; and that therefore I had nothing to do but to con-
sider of some safe retreat,in case I should see any savages
land upon the spot. V ,
2': Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave
so large as to bring a door through-again, which door, as
I said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to
the rock. u: Upon maturely considering this, therefore,
I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the man-
ner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where
' I had planted a double rowof trees about twelve years
before, of which I made mention: these trees having been
lanted so thick. before, there wanted but afew piles to
be driven between them, that they should be thicker and
stronger, and my wall would be soon finished. ,7154 LIFE AND 'Anvunrvmss or 30312150)! causes.

2: So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall
was, thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every-
thing I could think of, to make it strong; having in it
seven little holes, about as big as I might put myarm
out at. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about
ten feet thick, continually bringing earth out of my cave,
and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets, of which I took notice that I got seven "on shore
out of the ship: these, I say, I planted like my cannon,

and fitted them into frames that held them like a carriage,

that so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes'
time. This wall I was many a weary month in finish-
ing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my
wall, for a great way every way, as fullwith stakes or sticks
of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as
they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might
set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving apretty large
space between them and my wall, that I might have room

to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the

young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and in
five or six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling,
grown so monstrous thick and strong, that it was, in-

deed, perfectly impassable; and no man, of what kind '

soever, .would ever imagine that there was anything be-
yondit, much less a habitation..' As for. the -way I pro-
posed myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it
was by setting two ladders; one to a part of the rock
which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place
another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were
taken down, no man living could come down to me with-
out mischiefing himself; and if they had come down, they
were still on the outsiddof my outer wall. '

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could '
' suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen at'

length, that they were not altogether without just reason
----though I foresaw nothing at that time more than" my
mere fear suggested.*Aw-r 7-4

' While this was doing, _I was not altogether careless of
my other afi'airs, for I had a great concern upon me for
.- my little herd of goats; they were not only a present sup-
;; ply to me upon every other occasion, and to be suflicient
" for 'me without the expense of powder and shot, but also
, abated the fatigue of my hunting'after the wild ones;
" f and Iwas loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have
" them all to nurse up over again. '
' To this purpose, after long consideration, ~I could think
but of two ways to preserve them: one was to find another
' convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive
I >> , them into it everynight; and the other was to enclose two
i , t' or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and
g as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about
, half a dozen young goats in each place, so that if any
' ' disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be able '
e . to raise them again with little trouble and time; and this,
if: though it would require a great deal of time and labour, >>
'2 I thought was the most rational design. ~
Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most
, retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one which
3 was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish, for it was
a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the hollow
and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost my-
self once before, endeavouring to come back that way from
the eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece
' of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that
Z it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least, it did not
3. * want near so much labour to make it so, as the other pieces
of ground I had worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of ground,
and in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round
that my flock, or herd, call it which you please, which
,- were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed
'7; to be, were well enough secured in it. So, without any
3 farther delay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats
to this piece; and when there, I continued to perfect the
f fence, till I had made it as secure as the other,'which,
however, Idid at more leisure, and it took me up the more
time by a great dealArr. this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on the accOunt of the print of a man's foot
which I had seen, for as yet I never saw any human crea-r-
ture come near the island, and I had now lived two years
under these uneasinesses, which; indeed, made my life:

" were not able to look any longer--whether it Was a boat
'301' not, I did not know; but as I descended from the hill,

7 _' I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I re<<

solved to go no more without a perspective glass in my '
ocket.

[3 WhenI was come down the hill to the end of the island,
where indeed I had never been before, I was presently
' convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was
not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined; ~
and, but that it was a special providence that I was cast
upon the side of the island where the savages never came,
I should easily have known, that nothing was more he
quent than for the canoes from the main, when they hap&
pened to be a little too far out at sea, to shot over to
that side of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often
met, and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken
any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where,
according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals,
they would kill and eat them--of which hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the share, as I said

above, being the south--west point of the island, I was
perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for
me 'to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore
spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human
bodies; and, particularly I- observed a place where there
had been a fire made, and a circle dug' m the earth, like
a cock-p it, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat
' . down to 1)their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their
fellow- creatures.

I was so astonished at the sight of these things that I
entertained no notions of any dangerto myself from it
for along while; all myapprehensions were buried in

* the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish .bru-
tality,' and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature ; '
which, though I had heard of often, yet I' neverhad so
near a view of before--in short, I- tumed away my face
from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I
' was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged '
the disorder from my stomach, and having vomited with
an uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could
not bear to stay' in the place a moment, so I got me up
the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on
towardsag my own habitationP '

' When I came 'a little out of that part of the island, I
stood still a while as amazed; and then recovering my-
self, I looked up with the utmost afiection of my soul,
and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God'thanks,
that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I
was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these ;
and that, though I had esteemed my present condition
very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it,
that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain
of ; and this above all, that I had, even in this miserable
condition, been comforted with the knowledge of himself,
and the hop e of his blessing, which was a felicity more
than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer. \

. In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle '
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before--for I observed,
that these wretches never came to this island in search
of what they could get--perhaps not seeking, not want-
ing, or not expecting anything here, and having often,
no doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it, without
finding anythingto their purpose. I knew Ihad been here
now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least foot-
steps of a human creature there before; and might be
here eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now,
if I did not discover myself to them, which I had 'no
manner of occasion to do, it being my only business to
keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I
found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make

yself known to.
mYet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating-
one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, andPRECAUTIONS AGAINST mscovnav. . 159
kept close within my own circle for almost two years after
this ;- when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three
plantations,5namely, my castle, my country seat, which
I called my bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor
did I look after this for any other use than as an enclo-
sure for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave .
me to these hellish vwretches was such, that I was as
fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself; nor
did I so much as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of making me another; for 1
could not think of ever making any more attempts to
bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should
meet with some of those creatures at sea, in which, if I '
had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot; gasses:- {l-t-:;:,;':; 3%; fan-1
a>>: Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was
in 'no danger of being discovered by these people, began-'
, to wear off my uneasiness about them, and I began to
' - live just in the same composed manner as before; only
with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept
my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should
",7 happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them on
the'island should happen to hear it; and it was there-
fore a very good providence to me, that I had furnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I had no need to
hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and
if I did catch any more of them after this, it was by traps '
and snares,' as I had dome before-<<so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once' off, though
I never Went out without it: and, which was more, as I
had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in
my goat-skin belt :J Ilikewisefurbished up one of the great '
cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt
to put it in also :x so that I was now. a most formidable
fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the
former description of myself, the particular of two pis- -
tols, and a great broadsword hanging at my side in a

'fl" tended to show me more and more how far my condition

was from being miserable, compared to some others-ea. "
.'nay, to many other particulars of life, which it might .

have pleased God to have made it my lot. It put me
upon reflecting, how httle repining there would bep among
mankind, at any condition of life, if peop ple would rather
, compare their condition with those that are worse,m
] order to be thankful, than to be always comparing them
'with those which are better, to assist their murmurings
' and complainings.
As in my present condition there was not really ymany
things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the
. frighgts I had been in about these savage wretches, and the
concern I had been in- for my own preservation, had taken
off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences, and
' I had dropped a good design 1gn, which I had once bent my
, thoughtsp upon; and that was, to try if I could not make
some of my barley into malt, and then to tryto brewmy self
some beer Thisy was really a whimsical thought, and I re-
- proved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I presently
L saw there would be the want of several things necessary

' f to the making my beer, that would be impossible for me ' '

' to supply , as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a

thing that, as I have observed already, I could never-

compass--no, though I spent not many days, but weeks,
nay, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. ,- 3 In
the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast
to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and

yet,- had not all these things intervened--I mean the "
frig hts and terrors I was in about the savages--I had un- .
dertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I '

seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it,
when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for

night and day I could think of nothing but how I might ' '
destroy some of these monsters in thegir cruel bloody env'r

bring hither to destroy.? It would take up a larger volume
than this whole work is intended to be, to set down all
the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in
my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at
.5 least frightening them, so as to prevent their coming
hither any more; but all was abortive--nothing could
be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do
it myself; and what could one man do among them, when
perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together,

' an Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds
;: j of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, would
consequently take fire, and blow up all that was near it;
73' but as, in the first place, I should be very loath to waste
7;; so much powder upon them, my store now being within
'= V __the quantity 'of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of its
-" going ofi' at any certain time, when it might surprise
V-_> them; and, at best, that it would little more than just
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but not
Ts, sufficient to make them forsake the place ; so I laid it aside,
. and then proposed, that I would place'myselfin ambush,
in some convenient place, with my three guns all double
loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony, let
fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound per-
haps two or three at every shot; and then, falling in
upon them with my three pistols, and my sword, I made
no, doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should'kill
them all 7- This fancy pleased my thoughts for some
weeks ;- and I was so full of it that I often dreamed of
it; and sometimes, that I'was just going to let fly at
them in my sleep.
3- I went so far with, it in my imagination, that I em-
{j ployed myself several days to find out proper places to put
.L myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them; and
' I went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown

ting twenty or .thirty of them to the sword, as I may call
it; but the horror I had at the place, and at the signals
of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated
my malice. , -

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill,
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any
of the boats coming, and might then, even before they

. would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen
into the thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hol-
low large enough to conceal me entirely, and where I might
sit, and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full
aim at their heads, when they were so close together as that
it would be next to impossible that I should miss my
shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them
at the first shot.

In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design; and
accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary
fowling-piece. Two muskets I loaded with a brace of
slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size
of pistol bullets, and the fowling-piece I loaded with near

'a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size; I also loaded
my pistols with about four bullets each: and in this s-
ture, well provided with ammunition for a secon and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.

. After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in
my imagination put it in practice, I continually made my
tour every morning up to the top of the bill, which was
from my castle, as I called it, about three miles or more, ,
to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming
near the island, or standing towards it; but I began to
tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or three months
constantly kept my watch,rbut came always back without '
any discovery, there having not in all that time been the
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but not 5
on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could j
reach every way.

As longas I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look
out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and
my spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame

Submitted. ,

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing to me: these people had
done me no injury--that if they attempted me, or I saw
it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it; but that I was yet
out of their power, and they had really no knowledge of
me, and consequently no design upon me, and, there-
fore, it could not be just for me to fall upon them--that
this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all
their, barbarities practised in America, where they de-
stroyed millions of these people, who, however they were
idolators and barbarians, and had several bloody and
barbarous rites in their customs--such as sacrificing
human bodies to their idols--were yet, as to the Span-
iards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them
out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhor:
' rence and detestation, even by the Spaniards themselves,
at this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe,
as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of
cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man, and such,
as for which the. very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to
be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity, or of
Christian compassion: as if the kingdom of, Spain were
particularly eminent for the product of a race'of men who
were without principles of tenderness, or the common
bowels of pity to the miserablekwhich is reckoned to be
a mark of a generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to

a kind of a full stop; and I began by little and little to

be 011' my design, and to conclude I had taken a wrong -

measure in my resolutions to attack the savage's--that it
was not my business to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me, and this it was my business, if possible,
to prevent; but that, if I were discovered, and attacked,
then I knew my duty.

On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this<< ' really was not the way to deliver myself, but entirely to
, min and destroy my self, for unless I was sure to kill
-..~' every one that not only should be on shore at that time,
2' but that should ever come on shore afterwards--if but
i ' one of them escaped to tell their country people whathad
1 . v happened, they would come over again by thousands to
. :T'revenge the death of their fellows: and I should only
-L bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at pre-
sent I had no manner of occasion for.
J = E' g Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither inprinciples,
, . 'nor' in policy, I ought one way or other to concern my-
. self in this affair--that my business was," by all possible
means, to conceal myselfy from them, and not to leave
the least signal to them to guess by that there were any
_living creatures upon the island, I mean of human shape.
\Religion joined in with this prudential resolution, and
, I was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out
:3. of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes
for the destruction of innocent creatures--I mean, in-
- nocent as to me: as to the crimes they were guilty of
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them;
they were national punishments to make a just retribution
for national ofiences, and to bring public judgments upon
those who ofi'ended m a public manner, by such ways as
best please God.
a zThis appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a
greater satisfaction to me, than that I had not been suf-
fered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to
believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilful
murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most humble
thanks on my knees to God, that had thus delivered me
' from blood-guiltiness, beseecbing him to grant me the
,protection of his providence, thgat I might not fall into
the hands of barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands
' upon them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven
, to do it, in defence of my own life. '
'1', In this disposition I continued for near a year after
this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion for fall-
ing upon these wretches, that in all that time I never
' once went up the bill to see whether there were any of
them' in sight, or to know whether any of them had been
on shore there or not that I might not be temp ted to re-
new any of my contrivances against them, or hep provoked
by any advantage which might present itself, to Pfall up on
them , only this I did--I went and removed my boat,
which I had on the other side of the island, and carried
it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran
it into a little cove which I found under some high rocks,
and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages

durst not, at least would not, come with their boats, upon

any account whatsoever.

With my boat I carried away everything that I had
left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the
bare going thither--namely, a mast and sail, which I
had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but' m-
deed, which could not be called either anchor or grap-
pling--however, it was the best I could make of its kind.
All these I removed, that there might not be the least
shadow of any discovery, or any appearance of any boat,
or of any habitation upon the island.

Besides this, I kept my self, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employ ment--namely, to milk my
she-goats, and manage my little flockin the wood, which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was quite

out of danger, for certain it' is, that these savage people,

who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any
thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently

never gwandered off from the coast; and I doubt'not but
they might have been several times on shore, after my
apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as
before , and, indeed, I looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been,
if I had chopp gled upon them, and been discovered before
that, when naked and unarmed, except with one gun,
and that loaded often only with small shot. Iwalked
everywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to see
- what I could get--i-what a surprise I should have been
in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had

instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found.

. 1 them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of their running,
:rf no possibility of my escaping them. '
' y: The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul
within me, and distressed my mind so much that I could
not soon recover it; to think what I should have done,
L and howl not only should not have been able to resist
them, but even should not have had presence of mind
'5.~ enough to>> do what I might have done, much less what
1'>>. now, after so much consideration and preparation, I
j:->>might be able to do.SS Indeed, after serious-thinking of
f these things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes
~;-_- it would last a great while; but I resolved it at last all
x into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered
me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from
those mischiefs which I could no way have been the agent
7i in: deli ering myself from; because I had not the least
': g' notionvdf any such thing depending, or the least supposi-
" tion of its being possible. . ' >> ' "W
. it .This renewed a contemplation, which often had come
' 'to my thoughts informer time, when first Ibegan to see
' the merciful. dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we
_ ; run through in this life, how wonderfully we are delivered
when we know nothing of it--how when we are inga
quandary (as we call it), a doubt or hesitation whether
g to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us
'F ; this way, when we intend to go another way--nay, when
._.- sense, our own. inclination, and perhaps business, has
called to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon
the mind, from we knowinot what springs, and by we
.,. know not what power, shall overrule us to go this way:
elj and itshall afterwards appear, that had we gone that
I L way which we would have gone, and even to our imagin-
_--; ation ought to have gone, We should have been mined
i = and lost.>> Upon these, and many like reflections, I after-
' - wards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I
found those secret hints, or pressings of my mind, to
doing or not doing anything that presented, or to going
this way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret
dictate 3v though I knew no other reason for it, than that
' such a pressure. or such a hint hung upon my mind. I
could give many examples of the success of this conduct
in theg1 course of my life, but more especially in the latter
part of myinhabiting this unhappy island; besides many
occasions which it is very likely I might have taken no-
tice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I saw
with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I
cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are
attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such
secret intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible intelligence they will--that I shall not
discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certame
they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the
secret communication between those embodied and those
unembodied--and such a proof as can never be withstood
--of which I shall have occasion to give some very re-
markable instances, in the remainder of my solitary resi
dense in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if
I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I

 

lived in,>> and the concern that was now upon me, put an '

end to all invention, and to all the contrivances that I
had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences.
I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than
that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a
stick of wood now, for fear the noise I should make should
be heard--much less would I fire a gun, for the same
reason--and, above all, I was very uneasy at making any
fire, lest the smoke, which isswisible at a great distance

mthe day, should betray me; and, for this reason, I re-
moved that part of my business which required fire, such
as burning of pots andi p ifes, &c., into my new apartment
in the wood; where, after had been some time, I found, to

my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the >>\

earth which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no
savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy
as to venture in, nor indeed would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great
rock. where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not

'\* see an abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to
'- Providence), I was cutting down some thick branches of
trees to make charcoal; and before I go on, I must ob-
? fine the reason of my making this charcoal, which was
us --_-. 5 1: '
'4 I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation,
>> as I said before; and yegt I could not live there without
shaking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. , so-I contrived
' to burn some wood here, as I had seen done 1n Eng land,
under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal; andg then
' putting the fire out, I preserved the cOal to carry home,
. and perform the other services which fire was wanting
for at home, without danger or smoke ,
:But this by the b y.e 5 While I was cutting down some
wood here, I yperceived that, behind a very thick branch
, _ ~of l' brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of hol-
7' ' low p e; I was curious to look into it, and getting with
' difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large,
A that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and
perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you, I
made more haste out than I did in, when, looking farther
' into the place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad
.vshining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I
knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light
from the cave' 8 month shining directly in and making
"' the reflection"

However, after some pause, I recovered my self, and
beg an to call my self a thousand fools, and tell my y:self that
heg that was afraid to asee the devil was not yfit to live
3 twenty years in an island all alone, and that I durst to
i believe there. was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myself. Up on this, plucking up my cour-
_-'age, I took up a large firebrand, and m I rushed again,
' .with the stick flaming in my hand; I had not gone three
steps m, but I was almost as much frightened as I was
' before, for I heard a very loud sig h, likeg that of a man in
, some pain, and it was followed 3by a broken noise, as if
of words half expressed, and theny a deep sigh again. I
.'stepp ed back, and was indeed stmck with such a surprise
i--that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat
on my head, I Will not answer for it that my hair might
not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits as
well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with con-
sidering that the power and presence of God was every-
where, and was able to protect me; upon this I stepped
forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding
it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a
most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making his
will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of
mere old age; -

I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him out, and
he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself;
and I thought with myself, he might even lie there, for if
he had frightened me so, he would certamly fright any of
the savages if any of them should be so hardy as to come
in' there, while he had any life in him. .

' I was now recovered from my surprise, and began t
look round me, when I found thecave was but very small ;
that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in
no manner of shape, either round or square, no hands
having ever been employed in making it but those of mere
nature; I observed also, that there was a'. place at the
farther side of it that went in farther, but so low that it
required me to creep upon my hands and knees to get
into it, and whither it went I knew not: so, having no
candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-
box, which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets,
with some wild-fire in the pan.'

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six
large candles of my own making, for I' made very good '
candles now of goats' tallow; and, going into this low
place, I was, obliged to creep upon all-fours, as I have
said, almost ten yards, which, by the way, I thought was a
venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far
it might go, or what was beyond it. When I was got
through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I be-
lieve near twenty feet ; but never was such a glorious sight
seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round
the sides and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected

-' ' '7 what it was in the rock, whether diamonds or any other

j precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be,
. I knew not.
' The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or
grotto, 'of its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly
dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of small
.1 loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous crea-
ture to be seen; neitherwas there any damp or wet on the
, . ' sides of the roof: the only difliculty in it was the entrance,
, _ which, however, as itr~was a place of security, and such
a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience,
so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved,
without any' delay, to bring some of those things which
I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I
resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my
spare arms, namely, two fowling-pieces (for I had three
in all), and three muskets (for of them-I had eight in all ;
' so I kept at my castle only five, which stood rea y
mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence,
and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.

,1- Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I was
obliged to open the barrel of powder which I took up out
of the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the
' powder on every side, which, caking and growing hard,
had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell, so that
I had near sixty pounds of very good owder in the centre
of the cask; and this was an agreea le discovery to me
at that time: so I carried all away thither, never keeping
.' above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle,
for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried thither
all the lead I had left for bullets.

i I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live'in caves and holes in the rocks,
'where none could come at them; forI persuaded myself
while I was here, if_ five hundred savages were to hunt
me, they could never find me out; or if they did they
would not venture to attack me here. - '

there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than
to drag him out; so I interred him there, to prevent

CHAPTER XIII.

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this
island, and was so naturalised to the place and to the
manner of living, that could Ihave but enjoyed the cer-
tainty that no savages would come to the place to dis-
turb me, I could have been content to have cap itulated
for spending the rest of my time there, even toP the last
moment, till I had laid me ydown and died, like the old
goat in the cave all had also arrived to some little diver-
sions and amusements, which made the time pass more
pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before, as,
first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak;

and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulpately

and plain, that it was very ypleasant to me, and he lived
withp me no less than six-and-twenty years: how long he
might live afterwards I knew not, though I know they
have a notion in the Brazils, that they live a hundred
years; perhaps some of my Polls may be alive there still,

calling after Poor Robin Crusde to this day. -I wish no
Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear them;
butg if he did, he. would certainly believe it was the devil.

My dog was a very pleasant and yloving companion to me
for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died
of mere old age. As for my cats, they multip lied, as I
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot
several of them at first,gr to keep them from devouring
me and all I had; but at length, when the two old ones
I brought with me Were gone, and after some time con-
tinually driving them from me, and letting them have
no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods,
except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and
'i'ii whose young, when .they had any ,I always drowned,
and these were part of my family: besides these, Ialways
PS4; 'pke t two. or three housyehold kids about me, which I
" " taught to feed out of my hand; and I had also more
'3 parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin -
- Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I take
the pains with any of them that I had done with him.
7': -' I had also several ytame sea-fowls, whose names I know
5- not, which I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings ,
and the little stakes which I had planted before my castle
wall being now grown up to a good thick grove, these
. fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there,
' which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said
u . above, I began to be very well contented with the life I
' led, if it might but have been secured from the dread
. of savages.
. But\it was otherwise directed; and it might not be
amiss for all people, who shall meegwith my story, to
make this just observation from it, namely, how frequently,
<<in the course of our lives, the evil whichin itself we seek
most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the
most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door
of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again -
from the aflliction we are fallen into. I could give many
__ examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life;
but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than
; in the circumstances of my last years of solitary resi-
dence' in this island.
.-.It was now the month of December, as I said above,
. in my twenty- -third year; and this being the southern
j solstice--for winter I cannot call it--was the particular
' 7 time of my harvest, and required my being pretty much
abroad in the fields; 'when, going out pretty early in the
" morning, even before it was thorough day-light, I was
surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore,
- at a distance from me of about two miles, towards the
end of the island where I had observed some savages had
been, as before, but not on the other side, but, to my
great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
:5; Iwas,indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped

' Al '2'",
.short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest 1* '

might be surprisedg: and yet I had no more peace within,
from the apprehensions had, that if these savages,m
rambling over the island, should find my corn standing,

or cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would '

immediately conclude that there were people in the place,
and would then never give over till they found me out.
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled
up the ladder after me, having made all things without
look as wild and natural as I could. '

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a
posture of defence: I loaded all my cannon, as I called
them--that is to say, my muskets--which were mounted
upon my fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to
defend myself to the last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to
recommend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly
to pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the bar-
barians; and m this posture I continued about two hours,
but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad,
for I had no spies to send out.

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should
do 1n this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance
longer; so, setting up my ladder to the side of the hill
where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and
then pulling the ladder up after me, I set it up again,
and mounted to the top of .the hill; and pulling out my
perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose, Ilaid
me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to
look for the place. I presentlyjound there were no less
than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they
had made; not to warm them--for theyhad no need of
that, the weather being extremely hot--but, as I suppose,
to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh
which they had brought with them, whether live or dead
I could not know.

They had two canoes with tnem, which they had hauled .

up upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they
seemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go away
again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion this
sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my' .4. auxin annuals rough on THE SHOItEfi'z/ ,43'7175 I

:5?! side the island, and so near me too; but when I observed.
their coming must be always with the current of the ebb,
I beg an afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being
satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time
7 of tide of flood, ifg they were not on shorey before, and,
' 7 '5", having made this observation, I went abroad about my
I harvest work with the more composure. ,
5:}: As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide
~5_ made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row
E (orp addle, as we call it) all away :I should have observed,
if that for an hour and more before they went 011', they went
' to dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and
1: gestures by my glasses: I could only perceive, by my
:1 nicest observation, that they were stark naked, and had
not the least covering upon them; but whether they were
men or women, that I could not distinguish. ~
' . .25 As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two
>>; guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle,
and my great sword by my side, without a scabbard; and
with all the speed I was able to make, I went away to the
hill, where 1P had discovered the first appearance of all.
v" As soon as I got thither, which was not less than two
hours (for Legould not go apace, being so loaded with
arms as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes
~, more of savages on that place; and looking out farther,
I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the
main. :sz' 2 .v
* 'k A This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, going
: to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the
"_ dismal work they had been about had left behind it,
': namely, the blood, the bones, and art of the flesh of
7 human bodies, eaten? and devoured y those wretches
fje'with merriment and sport. I_ was so filled with indigna-
tion at the sight, that I began now to premeditate the
, , -destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be who
' ; or how many soever.
- 2' It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
2 thus made to this island were not very frequent; for iyt

any footsteps or signals of them, in all that time; for'as
to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come
abroad, at least not so far; yet all this while I lived un-
comfortably, by reason of constant apprehensions I was

. in of their coming upon me by surprise--from whence I

observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than
the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off
that expectation, or those apprehensions.

During all this time, I was in the murdering humour,

.and took up most of my hours, which should have been

better employed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall
upon them the very'next time I should see them, espe-

' cially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,

into two parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I ldlled
one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next
day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so another,
even ad infinitum, till I should be at length no less a mur-
derer than they wge in being men-eaters, and perhaps
much more so. , . '

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety
of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall
into the hands of those merciless creatures; if I did at
any time venture abroad, it was not without looking round
me with the greatest care and caution imaginable; and
now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that

- I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats; for I durst

not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near that
side of the island where they usually came, lest I should
alarm the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I

was sure to have them come back again, with perhaps

two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days,
and then I knew what to expect.

However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I
found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true,
they might have been there once or twice, but either they
made no stay, or at least I did not hear them; but in the
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my
four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter
with them, of which in its place.

\{7 * The= perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or
i " . sixteen months' interval, was very great; I slept unquiet,
' , ,9. dreamed always frightful dreams, and often started out
- "L of my sleep in the night: in the day. great troubles over-
whelmed my mind ;: in the night I dreamed often of
. killing the savages, and the reasons whyImight justify the
': doing of it; :But to waive all this for a while: it was in
5, the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well
9 as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked
j: all upon the post still--I say, it was on the sixteenth of
-- May that it blew a great storm of wind all day, with a
E' great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night
5 was after it: I know not what was the particular occasion
1' of it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up
- with serious thoughts about my present condition, I was
surprised with the noise of agun, as I thought, fired at sea.
332' This W, to be sure, a surprise of. a quite difl'erent
:, nature from any I had met with before:t for the notions
'1 this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a
~ trice, clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the
" rock, and pulled it after me, and, mounting it the second
a time, got to the top of the hill; that very moment a flash
" of fire bade me listen for a second gun, which, accord-
ingly, in about half a moment, I heard, and, by the
" sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where
I was driven out with the current in my boat.
*fi- I immediately considered that this must be some ship
in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some

together all the drywood I could get at hand, and, mak-
' ing a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill.

that several others, all from the same quarter. I plie '3! '

my fire all night long till day broke; and when it was '
broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a
great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether a
sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my
glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also: at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move, so I- presently concluded that

' it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may be
sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun inmy hand, and ran to-
wards the south-east side of the island, to the rocks, where
I had been formerly carried away with the current; and
getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly
clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck
of a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed
rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and
which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream,
and made a counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion
of my recovering then from the most desperate hopeless
conditiomthat ever I had been in all my life.

Thus, what is one man's safetyis another man's destruc-
tion; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being
out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholl under
water, had been driven upon them in the night, the wind
blowing hard at east andreast-north-east. Had they seen
the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not,
they must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved
themselves on shore by the help of their boat; but the
firing of their guns for help, especially when they saw, as I
imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts: first,
I imagined that, upon seeing my light, they might have
put themselves into their boat, and have endeavoured to
make the shore, but that the sea going very high, they
might have been cast away :' other times I imagined, that
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly, by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliges men to

There are some secret moving springs in the afi'ections: j ~ . =

or be it some object though not in view, yet rendered

clench together, and my fingers press the palms of my
hands, that if I had had any soft thing in my hand, it
would have crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in
my head would strike together, and set against one an-
other so strong, that for some time I could not part them
again. a? _

\ .Let the naturalist explain these things, and the reason

and manner of them; all I can say of them is, to describe
the fact, which was ever surprising to me when I found
it, though I knew not from what it should proceed: it
was doubtless the efi'ect of ardent wishes, and of strong.
ideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort which
the conversation of one of my fellow Christians would
have been to me. &

But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, or both,
forbade it ; for till the last year of my being on this island,
I never knew whether any were saved out of that ship
or no; and had only the affliction, some days after, to
see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore, at the
end of the island which was next the shipwreck: he had
on no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing
to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of.
He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and
a tobacco pipe: the last was to me of ten times more
value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might,4-- rnnmnns son A voner. TO THE wanes. 181

find something on board that might be useful to me ; but
37 that did not altogether press me so much, as the'possi
bility that there might yet be some living creature on
board, whose life I might not only save, but might, by
saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree: and
this thought clung so to my heart, that I could not be
quiet night nor day, but I must venture out in my boat
on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's
2,; providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon
.'~ my mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come i
from some invisible direction, and that I should he want-
ing to myself if I did not go. . V -
a 18. Under the power of this impression, I hastened back
ji' to my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a
,--, quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass
to steer by, a bottle of mm (for I had still a great deal
'of that left , abasket full of raisins; and thus loading
myself wi everything necessary, I went down to my
' boat, got the water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded
, A all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more:
my second cargo was a great bagful of rice, the umbrella
'1' to set up over my head for shade, another large potful of
.fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or .
barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's
milk, and a cheese; all which, with great labour and
sweat, I brought to my boat; and, praying to God to
direct my'voyage, 1 put out, and, rowing or paddling the
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point
of the' island, on that side, namely, north-east. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture or not to venture: I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island, at a
distance, and which were~ very terrible to me, from the
remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and
my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw, that if I was
';_drive'n into either of these currents, I should be carried
a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of reach or sight
'- of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but
, . small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be
' -- inevitably lost.3.",h

182 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON ORUSOE.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprise; and having hauled my boat
into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat
me down upon a little spot of rising ground, very pen-
sive and annous, between fear and desire, about my y-voy
age; when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the
tide was turned, and the flood came on, upon which my
going was for so many hours impracticable; up on this.
it presently occurred to me, that I should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and gobserve. if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the
flood camein, that I might judge whether,if I was driven
one way out, I might not expect to be driven another
way home, with the same rapidness of the currents.
This thought was no sooner in my head, but I cast my
eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked the
sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of
the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to
guide myself in my return; here I found, that as the
current of the ebb ~set out close by the south A oint of the
island. so the current of the flood set in close ythe shore
of the north side; and that I had nothing to do but to
keep to the north side of the island in my greturn, and 1
should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the first of the tide; and, repos-
ing myself for that night in the canoe, under the great
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I made first
a little out to seafull north, till I began to feel the bene-
fit of the current, which set eastward, and which car-
riedme at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as
the southern side current had done before, and so as to
take from me all government of the boat; but, having a
strong steerage With my p,addle I went, I say, at a great
rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I
came up to it.

It was a dismal si ght to look at: the ship, which by its
building was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two
rocks ; all the stem and quarter of her was beaten to pieces
with the sea: and as her forecastle, which had stuck in

.the rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast
and foremast were brought by the board, that" is to say,
: broken short ofl'; but her boltsprit was sound, and the
ff head and bow appeared firm. When I came close to her,
a dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me coming,

Iinto the sea to come to me, and I took him into the
z_ boat, but found him almost dead for hunger and thirst:
-' I gave him a cake of my bread, and he ate it like a rav-
enous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the
'snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water,
with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst

3r: Afte this I went on board. I The first sig ht' I met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of
the ship, with their arms fast about one another.-. I con-
cluded? as is, indeed, probable, that when the ship struck, '
.- it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so con
_.3 tinually over her, that the men were not gable to bear it
and were strangled with the constant rushing in of 'the
7;" water, as much as if they had been under water. Besides
.5 the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life,
" nor any goods that I could see, but whatp was spoiled by

the waters there were some casks of liquor, whither wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower' in the hold, and
which, the water being ebbed out, I could see; but they
. were too big to meddle with: I saw several chests, which
I behaved belonged to some of the seamen, and I got two of
' them into the boat without examining what was in them.

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, _

of about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with
much difficulty. There were several muskets in the
cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds
of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion
for them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I
took a fire-shovel and tongs,.which I wanted extremely,
as also two little brass kettles, a copper-pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron; andwith this ca1 go, and the
dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home
again; and the same evening, about an hour within
night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to
the last degree.
I reposed that 'night in the boat, and in the morning
'I resolved to harbour what I had g'otten in my new cave,
not to carry it home to my castle. After refreshing my-
self, I got all my cargo on shore, and beg an to examine
the particulars: ythe cask of liquor I found to be a kind
of mm, but not such as we had at the Brazils; and, in
a word, not at all good: but, when I came to op en the

ample, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extra-
ordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, and

tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good suc-
cades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top, that
the salt water had not hurt them, and two more Pof the
same, which the water had spoiled: I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and
coloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome,

I found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which
held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of
them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and
some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might
all weigh near a pound.

went the other way. '

CHAPTER XIV.

I LIVED in this condition near two years more; but my

' '_ unlucky head, that was always to let me' know it was

born to make my body miserable, was all these two years
filled with projects and designs how, if it were possible,
I might get away from this island--for sometimes I was
for making another voyage to the wreck, though my
reason told me, that there was nothing left there worth
the hazard of my voyage--~sometimes for a ramble one
way, sometimes another--and I believe verily, if I had
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have
ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to
those who are touched with that general plague of man-
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their miseries
flow--I mean, that of not being satisfied with the station
wherein God and nature hath placed them--for, not to
look back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent
advice of my father, the opposition to which was, as I '
may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of
the same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which
so happily had seated me at the Brazils as a planter,
blessed me with confined desires, and could I have been -
contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been
by this time--I mean in the time of my being on this
island--one of the most considerable planters in the
Brazils; nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvements
I had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase
I should probably have made if I had staid, I might have
been worth a hundred thousand moidores: and what
business had I to leave a settled fortune, well stocked
plantation, improving and increasing, to turn supercargc
to Guinea, to fetch negroes, when patience and time would' 5- ' - Bernsorross,

' have so increased our stock at home, that we could have
bought them at our own doors from those whose business

  

g :3? it was to fetch them ? And though it had cost us some-
9': thing more, yet the difference of that price wasby no
% means worth saving at so great a hazard. ,

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so re
flection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise
of more years, or of the dear bought experience of time
"'i--rand so it was with me now;. and yet, so deep had the .
mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy
. ' myself in my station, but was continually poring upon

. _ the means and possibility of my escape from this place;
and that I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader,
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be
improper to give some account of my first conceptions
1., on .the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape; and
A _ how, and upon what foundation, I acted.

* I am now to be supposed to be retired into my castle,
' '~ after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up, and

' ~ I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or

, the happy posture of my afi'airs, in the first years of my
habitation here, to that course of anxiety, fear. and care,
which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a
foot in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages

had frequented the island even all the while, and might '

have been several hundreds of them at times on the shore
there, but as I had never known it, and was incapable
_ of any apprehensions about it,\my satisfaction was per-
fect, though my danger was the same; and I was as happy
in not knowing my danger, as if I had never really been
exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with many
very profitable reflections, and particularly this one :--
How infinitely good that Providence is, which has settled
in its government of mankind such narrow bounds to his
sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks in
the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of
which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and
sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having
the events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing no-
thing of the dangers which surround him!
After these thoughts had forsome time entertained me,
I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been
in for so many years in this very island; and how I had
walked about in the greatest security, and with all pos-
sible'tranquility, even perhaps, when nothing but a brow
of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night,
had been between me and the worst kind of destruction
---name1y, that of falling into the hands of the cannibals
and savages, who would have siezed on me with the same
view as I did on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it
no more a crime to kill and devour me than I did of a
pigeon or curlew. I should unjustly slander myself, if
I should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great
Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged;
with great humility, that all these unknown deliverances
were due, and without which I should inevitably have
fallen into their merciless hands. .
When these thoughts were over, my head was for some
time taken up in considering the nature of those wretched
creatures, I mean the savages; and how it came to pass

in the world, that the wise Governor of allthings should .
. a give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity--nay,
.to something so much below even brutality itself--as to
devour its own kind: but as this ended' 1n some (at that
time fruitless)sp eculations, it occurred to me to inquire
what part of the world these wretches lived 111: how far
off the coast it was from whence they came , what they
"ventured so far from home for; what kind of boats they
had; and why I might not order myself, and my business,
so that I might be as able to go over thither as they were
to come to me.PS- r~\x;degr
.rg'c I never so much as troubled myself to consider what
5 I should do with my self when I came thither; what
"2 should become of me yif I fell into the hands of the- -sav-
ages, orhowI should escape from themif the yattempted
to take me; no, nor so much as how it Was possible for.
j, . me to reach the coast, and not be attacked by some or
*7 other of them,- without any possibility of delivering gmy--
self; and, if I should not fall into their hands, what. I
should do for provision, or whither I should bend my
course: none of these thoughts, I say, so much as came
in my way , but my mind was wholly bent upon the no-
tion of my passing over in my boat to the mainland. I
looked back up on my present condition as the most mis-
erable that could possibly be; that I was not able to
throw myself into anything but death that could be called
.;;<< worse that if I reached the shore of the main, I might
U perhaps meet with relief; or I might coast along, as 1
"5 did on the ore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited
country, an where I might find some relief, and after
all, perhaps, I might fall m with some Christian ship
that might take me in; andif the worst came to the worst,
.I could but die, which would put an end to all these mis.
' mes at oncez; Pray, note, allp this was the fruit of a dis-
turbed mind--an impatient temper, made, as it were,
desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, and
the disappointments I had met m the wreck I had been
on board of, and where I had been so near the obtaining
of what I so earnestly longed for, namely, somebody to
speak to, and to learn some knowledge from, of the place190 mm m wvnxroaris or nonmsou cnuson,

where I was,.and of the probable means of my deliVer-
ance--I say, I was agitated wholly by these thoughts.
All my calm of mind in my resignation t6 Providence,
and waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven,
seemed to be suspended ; and I had, as it were, no powerto
- turn my thoughts to anything but the project of ayoyage
to the main, which came upon me with such force, and such
an impetuositg of desire, that it' was not to be resisted.
When this ad agitated my thoughts for two hours or
more, with such violence that it set my very blood into
' a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as if I had been in
a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my
mind about it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and ex'
hausted with the very thought of it, threw me into a
sound sleep: one would have thought I should have
dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of anything relating
to it '; but I dreamed, that as I Was going out in the
morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the
shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and
that they brought with them another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him, when, on a sud-
den, this savage that they were going to kill, jumped
away, and ran for his life; then, I thought in my sleep,
that he came running into my little thick grove, before
my fortification, to hide himself: and that I, seeing him

alone, and not perceiving that the others sought him '

that way, showed myself to him, and smilingnpon him,
encouraged him; that he kneeled down, to me, seeming
to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed my lad-
der, made him go up it, and carried him into 'my cave,
and he became my servant>>; and that as soon as I got this
man, I said to myself, " Now I may certainly venture to
the mainland; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot,
and will tell me what to, derand whither to go for pro-
visions, and whither not to go {or fear of being devoured ;
what places to .venture into, and what to escape." I
waked with this thought, and was under such inexpres"
sible impressions of joy at the prospect a! my escape in
my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon
coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than

reconcile my self to a great while

a However, at last, after many secret disputes with my-
self, and after great perplexities about it (for all these
_-,,; arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head
:1, a long time), the eagerp prevailing desire of deliverance
at length mastered all the rest, and I resolved, <<if pos-
'; 7 sible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost
what it would. The next thing ,then, was to contrive
how to do it; and this indeed was very difiicult to re-
:_ solve on: but as I could pitch on no possible means for
_ it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch to see them
' when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event,
taking such measures as the opportunity should present,
. let it be what it would.

is. With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself

s
upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed, so often.

till I was heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and
a half that I waited, and for a great part of that time
went out to the west end and to the south-west corner
of the island, almost every day, to see the canoes, but
none appeared. This was very discouraging, and began
to trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did in
thiscase, as it had done some time before that, namely,
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing; but the longer
it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it: in

a word, I was not at-first more careful to shun the sight '

of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, than I
was now eager to be upon them. - '

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them en-
tirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,
and'to prevent their being able, at any time, to do me
any hurt. It was a great while that-I pleased myself
with this affair, but nothing still presented; all my
fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no, savages came
near me for a great while.

About -a year and a half after I had entertained these
notions, and by long musing had, as it were,.resolved
them all into nothing, for want of an occasion to put them
in execution, I was surprised one morning early with see~

ring no less than five canoes all on shore together, on my

side the island, and the people who belonged to them all

' landed, and out of my sight ; the number of them broke all

my measures ; for seeing so many, and knowing that they
always come four, or s1x, or sometimes more, m a boat,

I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take any-
measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; '

so, I lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted;
however, I put myself into all the same postures for an
attack that Ithad formely provided, and was just ready
for action if anything had presented. Having waited a
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at
length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot
of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of thehill by my
two stages, as usual, standing so, however. that my headr1111 sAvAoas nAvn 'rwo vicrms TO an arms. 193

'did not appear above the hill, so that they could not per-

5 At that very moment, this poor wretch, seeing himself a
' little at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life,-
; and he started away from them, and ran with incredible
'7 swiftness alongthe sands, directly towards me--I mean

1 my dream for the rest of it, namely, that the other saw -.

guns. for they were both at the footof the ladder, as I
observed above; and getting up again with the same
haste to the top of the bill, I crossed towards the sea;
and having a very short cut, and all down hill, clapped
myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued,

his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could
, ~ have done it sooner or better, which I thought very
strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw
sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords.
however, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make
their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is
so hard that they will cut ofi heads even with them--ay,
and arms, and thyat at one blow too. When he had done
this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph and
brought me the sword again, and, with abundance 1)of ges-
tures? which I did not understand, laid it down, with the
head of the savage that he had killed, just before me. -
But that which astonished him mostJ was, to know how
I had killed the other Indian so far 01f; so, pointing to
him, he made signs to me to let him go to him; so I
bade him go, as well as I could. When he came to him,
he stead like one amazed, looking at him--turned him
- first on one side, then on the other--leoked at the wound
the bullet had made, which, it seems, was just in his
. breast, where it made a hole, and no great. quantity of
' blood had followed, but he had bled inwardly ,for he was
quite dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows, and >>
came back, so I turned to go away, and beckoned him
to follow me, making signs to him that more might come
after them.
Up on this he sign ed to me that he should bury them
withp sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if r
they followed, and so I made signs again to him to do
so. He fell to work, and in an instant he had scraped a
hole 111 the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the
first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered him.
and did so also by the other; I,believe he had buried
them both in a quarter of an hour: then calling him
, away,.I carried "him not to my castle, but quite away to
my cave, on the farther part of the island; so I did not
let my dream come to pass in that part, namely, that he
came into my grove for shelter.

and a draught of water, which I found he was, indeed,

'5: Y He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight long limbs, not too large, tall, and well
'. shaped, sci-rd, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age.
,' He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly
' aspect, but seemed to have something very manly' in his
'i face, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an
European in his countenance, too, especially when he
3, smiled: his hair was long and black, not curled like wool;
his forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity and

i agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face

be my name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No,-
and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some

milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it be-

_ fore him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake

04? bread to do the like, which he quickly complied with,
and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it

' was day, I beckoned him to come with me, and let him- '

know I would give him some clothes, at which he seemed
very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by the
place where he' had buried the two men, he pointed ex.
actly to the spot, and showed me the marks that he had
made to find them again, making signs to me that we
should dig them up again and. eat them: at this I up
peared very angry, expressed my abhorrenoe of it, made
as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned
with my hand to him to come away, which he did imme-
diately, with great submission. I then led him up to
the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone, and.
pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place
where they had been, but no appearance of them or of
their canoes; so that it Was plain that they were gone,
'and had left their two comrades behind them, without
any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery: but'having
now more courage, and, consequently, more curiosit , I
took my man Friday with me, giving him the swor in
his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I
found he could use very dexterously, making him carry
one gun for me, and I two for myself, and away we
marchedrto the place where these creatures had been;

, for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of,

them.' When I came to the place, my very blood ran

. chill in my veins, and my heart sank within me, at the

horror of the spectacle: indeed, it was a dreadful sight,
at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of
it: the place was covered with human hence, the ground
dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here and

all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been 7
making there, after a victory over their enemies, I saw
three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four
legsand feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies ;
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand, that they
brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of
them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself,
was the fourth; that there had. been a great battle bee
tween them and their next king, whose subjects, it seems,
he had been one of t' and that they had taken a great num-
ber of prisoners, all which were carried to several places
by those that had taken them in the flight, in order to

he I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh,
' . and whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, '
and make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashesr-
I found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some
of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but
I discovered so much abhorrence at the Very thoughts of
it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not die-
cover it ;: for I had, by some means, let him know that I
would kill him if he offered it.
323 When we had done this, we came back tooul: castle,
and there I fell to work for m man Friday: and, first of
~ all, I gave him a pair of linen awers, which I had out of
f the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, and which Ifoundin
the wreck ; and which, with a little alteration, fitted him
.- very well; then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well
as my skill Would allow, and I was now grm a tolerably
-.,- good tailor; and I gave him a eap,'which I had made of
_. a here's skinnrery convenient, and fashionable enough:
and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably well,
- and mighty well was he pleased to see Minself almost as
well clothed as his master. Itis true, he went awkwardly
,. in these things at first; wearing the draWer's was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled
his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little easa '
- ing them where he complained they hurt him, and using:
: himSelf to them, at length he took to them Very well.
a The next day after I came home to my hutch with him,
'I began to consider where I should lodge him; and that
I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself,
I made a little tent for him in-the vacant place between
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the

, outside of the first: and as there was a door or entrance
there into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case,
and-a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage,
a little within the entrance; and, causing the door to
open on the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in
my ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at me
in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs awaken
me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of
long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the'
side of the hill, which was again laid cross with small
sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great
thickness with rice straw, which was strong like reeds;
and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by
the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had
been attempted on the outside, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great
noise; and as to-weapons, I took them all into my side
every night. '

.But I needed .none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or 'de-
signs ; perfectly obliging and engaging; his very affections
were tied to me like those of a child to a father; and I
dare say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving -
mine, upon any occasion whatsoever: the many testi-
monies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon
convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions as to
my safety on his account. .

.This fiequently gave me occasion to observe, and that
with wonder, that however it had pleased God in his pro-
vidence, and in the government of the works of his hands,
to take from so great a part of the world of his creatures
the best uses to which their faculties and. the powers of '
their souls are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon, _mmncrrone on rm: raovrnnNcn or son. 5201

  
  
  
  
   
    
   
  
 
    
  
   
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
  

, them the same powers, the same reason, the same afiec-
tions, the same sentiments of ldndness and obligation,
- the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same
sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity and all the capacities
': of doingg cod, and receiving good, that he has given to us;
,. and thatg when he pleases to ofl'er them occasions of ex-
' erting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply
1: them to the right uses, for which they are bestowed, than
' we are. And this made me very melancholy sometimes,
7 in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how
,. mean a use we make of all these, even though we have
3' these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,
. the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word, added
' to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to
, hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of
Z souls, who, if I mig ght judge by this poor savage, would
e make a much better use of it than we did.- ' '
' - From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the
' sovereignity of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the
f justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things ,that should
-' hide that light from some, and reveal it to others, and
' yet expect a like duty from both; but I shut it up, and
-' checked my thong htsy with this conclusion--first, that we
\ do not know by what light and law these should be con-
: demned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the
7: nature of his being ,infinitely holy and just, so it could
, not be but that, ifg these creatures were all sentenced to
; absence fiom himself, it was on account of sinning against
that light, which, as the Scripture says, was a' law to
' themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would
acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not
discovered to us: and, secondly, that still, as we are all

AMER I had been two or three day s returned to my castle,
I thought, that in order to bring Friday ofi nomhis her:
rid way of feeding g, and from the relish of a cannibal's
stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh, so I took
him out with8 me one morning to the Woods. I went,
indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it home angd dress it; but as I was going, I saw a
- she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids'
sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday: "Hold," said
I, ." stand still, " and made signs to him not to stir. Im~
mediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of

 

the kids. The poor creature, who had at a distance indeed '

seen me kill the saVage his enemy but did not know, or
could' imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed, that I
thOug ht he would have sunk down: he did not see the
kid I 3had shot at, or perceived I had killed it, but ripped
up his waistcoat to feel if he 'was not wounded; and, as
I found, presently thought I Was resolved to kill him,
for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing
my knees, said a great manythings I did not understand ,

but I could easily see that his meaning Was to pray mg -

not to kill him.'

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do
him no harm; and talnng him up by the hand, laughed
at him, and pointing to the kid which I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did, ' and
while he was wondering and looking to see how the
creature was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by andshot; so to let Friday understand a little what I would
do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a. parrot, though I thought it had been a
hawk--I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and
' to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would
\make him fall, I made him understh that I would
shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bid
him look, and immediately he saw the parrot _fall. He
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all that I
had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed,
because he did not see me put anything into the gun,
but thought there must be some wonderful fund of death
and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast,

this created in him was such as could not wear 011' for a
long time: and I believe, if I would have let him, he
Would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the 11

sq: answered him, .when he was by himself; which, as I
afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill
him. 'a'c'mzyrm'mv .
'v Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this
I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot,
which he did, but staid some tine; for the parrot, not
' being quite dead, had fluttered a good way ofl' from the
' place where she fell; however, he found her, took her
. up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his
ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to
' charge the gun again, and not let him see me do it, that
. I might be ready for any other mark that might present;
2 but nothing else offered at that time: so I brought home
the kid ;. and the same evening I took the skin off, and
;- out it out as well as I could, and having a pot for that
' purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made
>_ some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some,
I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it,

7. him was, to see me eat salt with it.:' He made a sign

as

byI at, great Mi, met hawk, sit upon a'tree within '

- bird, or anything, near or far off; for the astonishment,

itself, he would not so much as touch it for seVeral ays'
after, but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had, \

g and liked it very well; but that which was strangest to -
to me that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a
little into his own month, he seemed to nauseate it,- and
would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with
fresh water after it. 'On the other hand, -I took some
meat in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit

, and sputter for want of. salt, as fast as he had done at
the salt; but it would not do, he would never care for
salt with meat, or in his broth ; at least not a great while,
and then but a very little.

' Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I
was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a
piece of the kid :' this I did by hanging it before the fire
in a string, as I had seen many people do in England,
setting two poles up, one on each side of a fire, and one
cross on the top, and tying the string to the cross stick,
letting the meat run continually: this Friday admired
very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he took
so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I

A couldinot but understand him; and at last he told me
hewould never eat man's flesh any more, which I was
very glad to hear. , ' >>

" The next day I set him to work to beating some corn
out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I ob-
served before; and he soon understood how to do it as
well as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning
of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after
that I let him see :me make my bread, and bake it too;
and in a little time Friday was able to do all the work
for me, as well as I could do it myself. '

I began now to consider, that, having two mouths to
feed instead of one, I must provide more ground for my
harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used
to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and began
the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday
not only worked very willingly and very hard, but did it
very cheerfully; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for corn to make more bread, because he was now
with me, and that I might have enough for him' and my-
self too: he appeared very sensible of that part, and let
meknow that he thought I had much morelabour upon; gtmme erH rmnAr ABOUT Ins NA'rIon. 205

me on his account than I had for my self, and that he
would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what
tOdO- = inns: 3E9.
s: This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in
this lace. . Friday began to talk pretty well, and under-
stood the names of almost everything I had occasion to
call for, and of every place I had to send him to, and
. , talk a great deal to me; so that, in short, I beg an now
' to have some use for my tongue- again, which indeed I
had very little occasion for before--that is to say, about .
sp eech._-- Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself. his simple un-
feigned honesty app peared to me more and more every
day, 5:leand I beg an really to love the creature; and on his
side,I believe, he loved me more than ever it was pos-:
sible for him ever to love anything before.-. _. - . f
2:: Ihad a mind once to try ifhe had any hankering in-
clination to his own country again; and having learned
him English so well, that he could answer me almost any
.7 questions, I asked him, whether the nation that he be-
.3 long ed to never conquered in battle '2 At whichhe smiled,

and.g said " Yes, yes, we always fig ht the better"--that
is, he meant, alwaysg et the better in fig lit--and so we
' beg an the following discourse :--"You alway '3 fig ht the
better!" said I .1 "how came you to be taken prisoner,
then, Friday? " -
Friday. My nation beat much for all that. ,
1,: Master. How beat? If your nation beat them, how-
came you to be taken ?
. Friday. They more than my nation in the place where
me was; they take one, two, three, and me: my nation

there my nation take one, two great thousand.

Liz'- Master. .,Well Friday, and what does your nation do: -. -

FMag/nYes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.'
3;: Master; Where do they carry them ? ' '
Friday. Go to other place where they think.

ace. - -
If Master. Have you been here with them ? .
, May. Yes, I have been here [points to the north-west
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side].

'By this I understood, that my man Friday had for- .
'merly been among the savages who used to come on

. shore on the farther part of the island, on the said man-

eating occasions that he was now brought for; and some
time after, when I took the courage to carryhim to that
side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he presently
knew the place, and told me, he was there once, when
they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child: he
could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them
by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me

to tell them over.

:7 I have told this passage because it introduces what
follows; that after I had had this discourse with him, I
asked him how far it was from our island to the shore,
and whether the canoes were not often lost--he told me

. there was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but that after

a little way out to sea, there was a current and a wind
always one way in the morning, the other in the after- <
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the
tide, as going cut, or coming in; but I afterwards under-
stood it was occasioned by the great draught and reflux
of the mighty river Oroonoque, in the mouth of which
river, as I thought afterwards, our island lay; and that
this land which I perceived to the west and north-west, was
the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth
of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about
the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what
nations were near--aha told me all he knew with the
greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names
of the several nations of his sort of people, but could getowns aanxcicus msraucrmn 'ro ram". \ 207

no other name than Caribs; fromwhence I easily under-
stood, that these were the Caribbees, which our maps
place on that part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea, and onwards
to St Martha. He told me, that up a great way beyond
the moon--that was, beyond the setting of the moon,
which must be west from their country--"there dwelt
white-bearded men, like me, and pointed. to my great
whiskers, which I mentioned before ; and that they had
killed much mans--that was his word--by which I um
derstood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in
~ America had been spread over whole countries, and were
remembered by all the nations from father to son.

: a I in quired if yhe could tell me how I might come from
this island, and get among those white men; he told me
"Yes, yes, I mig ght go into two canoe. " I could not
understand what heg meant by two canoe, till at last,
with great difliculty, I found he meant, that it must be
in a larg 9 great boat as big as two canoes. -

"i This part grof Friday's discourse began to relishwith me
very well; and from this time I entertained some hopes,
that one time or other I might find an opportunity to
make my escape from this place, and that this poor savv
age might be a means to help me to do it.

a During the long time that I)Friday had now been with
me, and gthat he began to speak toy me, and understand -
me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious '
knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked himg1 one:
time, Who made him? The poor creature did not 1111-:
derstand me at all, but thoug pht I had asked who was
his father; but I took it by another handle, and asked
him, Who made the sea, the ground he walked on, and
the hills and'woods ? He told me it was one old Bena-
: muckee, that lived beyond all: he could describe nothing
of this great person, ybut that he was very oldu--much
'L'j older,hegr said, thanthe seaortheland, thanthemoonorthe
.se stars. s I asked him then, if this old person had made all
things, why did not all thing s worship him? He looked
very grave, and, with a perfect look of mnocence, said, .-
All things saidO l- to him>> I asked him if the people, . .

. who die' in his country Went away anywhere ?i He said,
-2 Yes, they all went to Benamuckee. . Then I askedhim, , 1
A whether 37those they eat up went thither too ?: He said, _ j
' . (Yes. . -kz '.nWtEES.ti- -'
"a, From these things I began to instruct him in the 9
knowledge of the true God. gaI told him, that the great
Maker of all things lived there, pointing up towards
heaven; that he governs the world by the same power
and providence by which he made it; ythat he was omni-
potent, could do everything for us, give everything to
us, take everything from us: and thus, by degrees, I
- jopened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and
7 received with pleasure the notion ofgr Jesus Christ being
sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making
our prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even
in heaven. he told me one day, that if our God could
hear us up beyond the sun, he ymust needs be a greater
God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way ,
' 013', and yet could not hear, .till they went up to the ~
. great mountains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I
- asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him 2 He
' r" said, No, they never went that were young men; none
' went thither ybut the old men, whom they called their
Oowookakee; that is, as I made him explain it to me,
' their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say 0!
' (so he called saying prayers), and then came back, and
told them what Benamuckee said" By this I observed,
that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded -
ignorant Pagans in the world; and the policy of making
' a secret of reli gion, in order to preservethe veneration of
the people to the clergy, isto be found among all religions
in the world, even among the most brutish and barbar-
ous savages. 1'
.41 I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday;
. and told him, that the pretence of their old men going
up to the mountains to say 0! to their god Benamuckeef
was a cheat, and their bringing word from thence what
he said, was much more so; that if they met with any
answer, or spoke with any one there, it must be with an evil
spirit: and then I entered into along discourse with him 'GIVES RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION TO FRIDAY. 209

about the devil, the origin al of him, his rebellion against
God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting
himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped
instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he
made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he
had a secret access to our passions and to our affections,
to adapt his snares so to our inclinations as to cause us
even to be our own tempters, and to run upon our own
destruction by our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprintrig ht notions in
his mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a
God: nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to
him even the necessity 'of a great First Cause, and over-
ruling governing Power, a secret directing Providence,
and of the equity and justice of paying homage to Him
that made us, and the like; but there appeared nothing
- of all this in the notion of an evil spirit, of his original,
his being, his nature; and, above all, of his inclination
to do evil, and to draw us in to do so to: and the poor
creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question
merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to
say to him.

I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of
. God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin, his

' being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how,
as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and all the
world, in a moment: and he listened with great serious-

. . uses, to me all the while. After this, I had been telling

 

him how the devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men,
and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good de.
' signs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ
- v in the world, and the like. "Well," says Friday, "but
. you say God is so strong, so great, is he not much strong,
,much might, as the devil?" "Yes, yes," said, I, "Fri-
day, God is stronger than the devil; God is above the
i devil r and therefore we pray to God to tread him under
' our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and
quench his fiery darts." "-But," says he, again, "if God
much strong, much might, as the devil, why God not kill
the devil, so make him no more wicked '1"? ' .

I was strangely surprised at his question; and, afier
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young
doctor, and ill enough qualified for a casuist, or a solver
of difficulties: and, at first, I could not tell what to say
so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he
said ? But he was too earnest for an answer to forget
his question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. B this time I had recovered myself a
little, and I said, " odwill at last punish him severely,
he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the
bottomless pit to dwell with everlasting fire." This did
'not satisfy Friday but he returns upon me, repeating
my wor ds, " Reserve at last! me no understand: but why
not kill the devil now, not kill great ago '2" "You may
as well ask me," said I, "why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that ofi'end him: we
are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He muses a
while at this." " Well, well," 'say 5 he. mighty afiection-

/ ately, "that well; so you, I, devil, all wicked, all pre-

serve, repent, God pardon all. " Here I was run down

again by him to the last degree, and it was a testimony
to me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will
guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a y,God
and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of
God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but
divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and of a redemption purchased for us; of 8. Mediator; of a
new covenant; and of an Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne--I say, nothing but a revelation from Hea-
ven can form these in the soul; and that therefore the
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the
Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised for the
guide and sanctifier of his peop ple, are the absolutely ne-
cessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving
knowledge of God, and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me

and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden '

occasion of going out; then sending him for something
great way off, I seriously prayed to God that he would
enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage, assistV -m-.--1.~:,,w 7-" w- r'.'"".' z .-- ark-7.9

ing, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant crea-
! ture to receive the light of the knowledge of God in
Christ, reconciling him to himself, and wouldvguide me
I to 'speak so to him hem the word of God, as his conscience
{i might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved.
'5 When he came again to me, I entered. into a long dis-
: course with him upon the subject of the redemption of
man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of

the Gospel preached from heaven, namely, of repentance
towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus ;I then
explained to him, as well as I could, why our blessed
Redeemer took not on him the nature: of angels but the

seed of Abraham, and how, for that reason, the fallen

' angels had no share in the redemption; that he came
r only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.
i, _ I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in
all the methods I took for this poor creature's instruc~
tion; and must acknowledge, what I believe all that
act'upon the same principle will find, that in laying
: -th.ings open to him, I really informed and instructed
..'. 4 , myself in many things that either I did not know, or
'v. had not fully considered before, but which occurred
' _ naturally to my mind upon my searching into them for
f g, the information of this poor savage: and I had more
g. afl'eotion in my inquiry after things upon this occasion
~.- than ever I felt before; so that, whether this poor wild
wretch was the better for me or no, I had great reason
to be thankful that ever he came to me. My grief sat
lighter upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me
beyond measure; and when I reflected that in this soli-
tary life, which I had been confined to, I had not only
been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to seek
to the hand that brought me thither, but was now to be
made an, instrument, under Providence, to save the life,
" Z and, for aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and

was brought to this place, which I had often thought the
most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have
befallen me.

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder
of my time; and the conversation which employed the
hours between Friday and me was such as made the
three years which we lived there together perfectly and
completely happy, if any such thing as complete happi-
ness can be found in a sublunary state. The savage was
now a good Christian, a much better than I; though I
I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were
equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We
had here the word of God to read, and no farther off from
his Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.

I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, and
to lethim know, as well as I could, the meaning of what
I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries and ques-
tions, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar
in the Scripture knowledge, than I should everhave been
by my own private reading. Another thing I cannot re-
train from observing here also from experience, in this
retired part of my life, namely, how infinite and inex-
- pressible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God, and

of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly
laid down in theword of God, so easy to be received and
understood, that as the bare reading the Scripture made
me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry
me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for
my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salva-
tion, to a stated reformation of practice, and obedience to
all God's commands, and this without any teacher or in-
structOr (I mean human) ; so the plain instruction'sufii-
ciently served to the enlightening this savage creature,
and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known
few equal tohim in my life. ' _

As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and contention,
which have happened in the world about religion, whether
niceties in doctrines, or schemes of church government,
they were all perfectly useless to us, as, for aught I can
yet see, they have been to all the rest in the world. We .nascmns ENGLAND, are, To ram". 213

had the sure guide to heaven, namely, the Word of God;
and we had, blessed be God! comfortable views of the
Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by his word,
leading us into all trutgh, and making'us both willing and
obedient to the instruction of his word; and I cannot see
the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed
points in religion, which have made such confusions in
" the world, would have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained it. But I must go on with the historical part of
things, and take every part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted,
and that he could understand almost all I said to him,
and speak fluently, though in broken English, to me, I
acquainted him with my own story, or at least so much
of it as related to my coming into the place, how I had
lived there, and how long: I let him into the mystery
(for such it was to him) ofgun powder and bullets, and
taught him how to shoot: Igun gave him a knife, which he
was wonderfully delig hted with, and I made him a belt
with a frog hanygin gmg to it, such as in En gland we wear
hangers m; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave
him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in
some cases, but much more useful upon many occasions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, and par-
ticularly Eng land, which I came from; how we lived,
how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one another,
and how we traded in ships to all the parts of the world.
I gave him an account of the wreck which I had been
on gboard of, and showed him, as near. as I could, the

place where she lay , but she was all beaten in pieces long
' ' . before, and quite gone.

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my
whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all to
pieces. . Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a
great while, and said nothing; I asked him what it was
he studied upon? At last, says he, "Me see such boat
like come to place at my nation."

-I did not understand him a good while; but at last,
when I had examined farther into it, I understood by .

.'1
him that a beat, such as that had been, came on shore
upon the country where he lived--that is, as he ex-
plained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I

' presently imagined that some European ship must have

been cast away upon their cosmt, and the boat might get
loose, and drive ashore; but was so dull, that I never
once thought of men making escape from a wreck thither,
much less whence they might come--:so I omy inquired
after a description of the boat. '

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but

brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with some warmth, " We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the boat? " Yes," he
said, " the boat full of white mans." I asked him, how
many '2 He told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked
him, what became of them '2 He told me " They live, they
dwell at my nation."
' This put new thoughts into my head again; for I pre
sently imagined, that these might be the men belonging
to the ship that was cast away in sight of my island, as
I now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on
the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved
themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild
shore among the savages.

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what was
become of them? He assured me they lived still there,
that theyhad been there about four years, that the savages
let them alone, and gave them victuals'to live. ' I asked
him how it came to pass they did not kill them, and eat
them ? He said, " N o, they'make brother with them "---
that is, as I understood him, a truce: and then he added,

is to say, they 'never eat any men but such as come to
fight with them, and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being on
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from
whence, as I have said, I had in a clear day discovered
the main or continent of America, Friday, the weather

being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the main-

. dancing, and calls out tome, for I was at some distance
from him: I asked him what was the matter? " Oh,
joy! " says he, "Oh, glad! there see my country, there
my nation I "

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared
in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance
discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to
be in his own country again ; and this observation of mine
put a great many thoughts into me, which made me at

\' first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was

before; and I made no doubt but that if Friday could get
back to his own nation, he would not only forget all his
' religion, but all his obligations to me: and'would be
forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me,
and come back, perhaps, with an hundred or two of them,
and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry
as he used to be with those of his enemies, when they were
taken in war.
; ' But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for
which I was very sorry afterwards; however, as my
jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little
more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him
as before; in which I was certainly in the wrong too,
the honest grateful creature having no thought about it,
but what consisted of the best principles, both as a re-
ligious Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared
" afterwards to my full satisfaction.

' . Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I
was-every day pumping him, to see if he would discover
any of the new thoughts which I suspected were in him;
but I found everything he said was so honest and so inno<<
cent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion;
and in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last en-

. 'tirelyhis own again--nor did he in the least perceive that
.gwas uneasy--and therefore I could not suspect him of
eceit. ' . -
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent,
.: I called to him, and said, "Eriday, do not you'xwish

  
  
 
   
    

land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a-jumping and .
yourself in your own country, your own nation ?"

-"Yes," he said, "I be much 0 glad to be at my own
nation. " " What would you do there ?" said I, " would '
you turn wild again, eat mens' flesh again, and be a
savage as you were before?" He looked full of con-
cern, and, shaking his head, said, "No, no! Friday tell
them to live g,ood gtell themto pyra God, tell them to eat
corn bread, gcattle flesh, milk, no eat man again."
"Why ,then," saidI tohim, "they will kill you!" He
looked grave at that, and then said, "No, they nokill
me; they willing love learn"--he meant by this, they

. would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then
I asked him if he would go back to them? He smiled _
at that, and told me he could not swim so far. Itold
him I would make a canoe for him. He told me he would
go, ifI would go with with him." I go I" said I, "why,
they will eat me if Icome there!" "No, no!" says he,
"me make them no eat you, me make they much love
you"~--he meant he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me how find they were to seven-
teen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who'
came on shore' in distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if I could possibly Join with these bearded
men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portu-
guese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find some
method to escape from thence, being upon the continent
and a good company together, better than I could from
an island forty miles 011' the shore, and alone without
help. So, after some days ,I took Friday to work again,

~ by way of discourse, andys told him I would give him a
boat to go backto his own nation; and accordingly, I
carried him to my fri g,ate which lay on the other side of
the island; and having cleared it oyf water (for I always
kep tit sunk" in the water), I brought it out, showed it
him, and we both went into it.

could; so when he was in, I said to him, "Well, now,
Friday, shall we go to your nation?" He looked very
dull at my saying so, which it seems was because he
thought the boat too small to go so far. I told him
then I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place
.where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I
could not get into the water: he said that was big
enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it
. had lain two or three-and-twenty years there, the sun
had so split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten.
Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and
would carry " much enough vittle, drink, bread "--that
was his way of talking. '

CHAPTER XVI.

UPON the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my
design of going ,over with him to the continent, that I
told him we would go and make one as big as that, and
he should go home in it. He answered not one word,
but looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was
'the matter with him? He asked me again, thus, " Why
you angry mad with Friday ? what me done?" I asked
him what he meant? I told him I was not angry with
him at all. "No angry: no angry!" says he, repeating
.. v the words several times; "why send Friday home away
to my nation ?" "Why," said I, "Friday, did you not
say you wished you were there ?" "Yes, yes," says he,
" wish be both there; 'no wish Friday there, no master
3:, there." In a word, he would not think of going there
- without me. "I go there, Friday 1" said I; " what
should I do there ?" 'He turned very quick upon me at
this. " You do great deal much good," says he; " you
teach wild mans to be good, sober, tame mans; you tell
: them know God, pray God, and live new life." "Alas,
it ' Frida ," said I, "thou knowest not what thou sayest; ,
' ' I am ut an ignorant man myself." "Yes, yes," says
' be, "you teechee me good, you teechee them good."

218 LIFE AND ADVENTURES O!' ROBINSON ORUSOE.

"No. no, Friday," said I, " you shall go without me;
leave me here to live by myself, as I did before." He
looked confused again at that word, and running to one
of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up
hastily, and gives it me. " What must I do with this ?"
said I to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. " What
must I kill you for?" said I again. He returns very A
quick, " What you send Friday away for? Take kill '
Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so ear-
nestly, that I- saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I
so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me,
and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and
often after, that I would not send him away from me, if
he was willing to stay with me. *
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a i
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part him i
from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire to go i
to his own country, was laid in his ardent affection to the a
people, and his hopes of my doing them good--a thing i
which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the 1
least thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking it. 3
But still I found a strong inclination to my attempting 1']
an escape, as above, founded on the supposition gathered '3,
from the former discourse--namely, that there were seven- '
teen bearded men there; and therefore, without delay, I 1
went to .work with Friday, to find out a great tree pro-. i
per to fell, andmake alarge periagua, or canoe, to under- g,-
take the voyage. There were trees enoughrin the island :1

to have built a little fleet, not of 'periaguas and canoes .
only, but of good large vessels: but the main thing I
looked at, was to get one so near the water that we might
launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I com-
mitted at first. _

At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he .
knew muchbetter than I what kind of wood was fittest for
it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree
we cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call
fustie, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was for
burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it

into a boat: but I shOWed him how rather to cut 1t out
, with tools, which, after I showed him how .to use, he did ,,
. } Very handily; and in about a month's hard labour we
' finished it, and made it very handsome, especially when,
with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we
_ _ cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat.
, ' After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight' s time to
V; | to get her along, as it were, inch by inch, upon great
. " rollers, into the water; but when she was in, she would
. have carried twenty men with great ease. '
' -When she was in the water, and though she was so
big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how
swift, my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and
paddle her along; so I asked him if he would, and if we
might, venture over in her? "Yes," he said, "he ven-
ture over in her very Well, though great blow wind." How
ever, I had a further design which he knew nothing of
and that was, to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with
an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough
to get; so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree,
' . which I found near the place, and which there was a great
' plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to work to cut
' . it down, and gavo him directions how to shape and order
,' w' it: but, as to the sail, that was my particular care; I
, knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough,
h but, as I had had them now twenty- six years by me, and
i if. had not been very careful to preserve them, not magin
" - ing that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I
- did not doubt but that they were allrotten--and, indeed,
: ' most of them were so; however, I found two pieces which
appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work, and
'- with a great deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching
(you may be sure) for want of needles, I at length made
a three- cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England
a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom,
j. and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually our
:37 ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how
' U to manage; because it was such a one as I used in the
boat m which I made my escape from Barbary, as re'
lated in the first part of my story. 1
    

I was near two months performing this last work,
namely, rigging and fitting my mast and sails; forIfin-
ished them very complete, making a small stay ,and a sail
or foresail to it, to assist if we should turn to ywindward;
and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern
of her, to steer with; and though I was but a bungling '-
shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness, and even neces - :
sity, of such a thing, I applied myself with so much -
pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass, though, A,
considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that ' i
failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as mak- '
ing the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat '
for though he knew very well how to paddle the canoe,
he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder,
and was the more amazed when he saw' me work the
boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the
sail gibed and filled this way or that way, as the course
we sail changed--I say, when he saw this, he stood like
one astonished and amazed: however, with a 'little use,-

I made all these things familiar to him, and he became
an expert sailor, except that as to the compass I could
make him understand very little of that: on the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom
or never any fogs, in those parts, there was the less
occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be
seen by night, and the shore by day, except 1n the rainy
seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by
land or sea. ' '

I was now entered on the seven- -and-twentieth year of
my captivity in this lace; though the three last years
that I had this creature with me, cug ht rather to be left
out of the account, my habitation being quite of another
kind than in all the rest of my time. I kept the anni-
versary of my landing here with the same thankfulness
to God for his mercies as at first; and if I had such
cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so
now, having such additional testimonies of the care of
Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being -.ARRIiTAL or THREE CANOEE. 22]

efiectually and speedily delivered, for Ihad an invincible
j impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was
' at hand, and that Iy should not be another year in this
place. However, I went on with my husbandry, digging,
1; plantings, and fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured
' my grapes, and did every necessary thing,as asbefore.
>> - The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when
' I kept more within doors than at other times, so I stowed
. , our new vessel as secure as we could, bringin gmg her up
, into the creek, where, as I said' in the beginning, I landed -
, my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the shore,
' at hi gh-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little
dock, 3just big enough for her to y'float 1n; and then, when
the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end
. of it, to keep the water out; andso she lay dry ,as to
~ 7 the tide, from the sea; and, to keep the rain off, we laid
a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as
well thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the
months of November and December, in which I designed
to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair weather, I
was preparing daily for. the voyage, and the first thing
I did was to lay up a certain quantity of provision, being
the store for the voyage, and intended, in a week or a
fortnight's time, to open the dock and launch out ,our
boat. I was busy one morning upon something of this
kind, when I called to Friday and bade him go to the
V sea--shore and see if he could find a turtle, or tortoise,
a thing which we generally got once a-week, for the sake
of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
long gone when he came running back, and flew over my
outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground
_ or the steps he set his feet on; and before I had time to
speak to him, he cried out to me, "Oh, master! Oh,
master! Oh, sorrow! Oh, bad I " "What's the matter,
,~ Friday ?" said I. "Oh, yonder there," says he, "one,
., two, three canoe! one, two, three! " By this way of ,

, speaking I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I
" I found there were but three "Well, Friday," said I"- doinot be frighted ;'" so I heartened him up aswell as

I could- Hov'vever, I saw the poor fellow was most ter- '

ribly scared; for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces
and eat' him. The poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce

knew what to do with him. I comforted him as well as
I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he,

and that they would eat me as well ashim. " But," said . '

I, " Friday ,we must resolve to fig ht them: can you fight,
Friday? "y " Me shoot," says he, " but there come many
great- -."number " No matter for that, " said I again;
"our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I
asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade
him ? He said, "Me die when you bid die, master. "
So I, went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; .for I had been so good'a husband of 111me that
I had a great deal left. When he had drunk it, I made
him take the two fowling- -pieces which we always carried,
and load them with large swan- shot as big as small pis-
tel-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them
with two slugs and five small bullets each, and my two
pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each--I hung

my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave
Friday his hatchet.

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspec-
tive glass, and went up to the side of the hill to see What
I could discover, and I found quickly, by my glass, that
there were one- and- -twenty savages, three prisoners, and
three canoes; and that their whole business seemed to be
the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies
wa barbarous feast, indeed, but nothing more than, as I
had observed, was usual with them. '

.I observed also that they were landed, not where they

had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my

creek, where the shore 'was low, and 'where a thick wood
came close almost doWn to the sea--this, with the abhor-
rence of the inhuman errand these wretches owe abOut,
so filled me with indignation, that I came down again to
Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to them

'-nusonvns ro ATTACK r1111 SAVAGES. 223'

'_ and kill them all, and asked him if he would stand by me.
He was now gotten over his fright, and his spirits being

a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very

r I cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid

die.

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms,
which I had charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday
one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his

, shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three my-

self; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small
bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave, Friday a large bag
with more powder and bullets ; and as to orders, I charged

' him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot,

or do anything till I bade'him; and, in the meantime,
not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a com-
pass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over

' the creek as to get into the wood; so that I might come

within shot of them before I could be discovered, which
I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this marchy, my former thoughts
returning, I beg an to abate my resolution--I do gnot
mean that I entertained any fear of their number; for as
they were naked unarmed wretches, it is certain I was
superior to them, nay, though I had been alone--~but it
occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much
less what necessity, Iwas m to go and dip my hands in blood
e--to attack people who had neither done nor intended
me any wrong, who, as to me, were innocent, and whose '

barbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them
' a token indeed of God's having left them, with the other

nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity and
to such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take

h- . upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an

Texecutioner of his justice; that whenever he thought fit,

that,~.in the meantime, it was none of my business--'- .
'_ that it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was"

them; but I could not say the same with respect to me.
These things were so warmly pressed upbn my thoughts
all the way'as I went, that I resolved I would only go
place myself near them, that I might observe their bar-
barous feast, and that I would act then as God should
direct; but that, unless something offered that was more
a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with
them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all
possible wariness and silence (Friday following close at
my heels), I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood,
on the side which was next to them--only that one cor-
ner of the wood lay between me and them--here I called
softly to Friday, showing him a great tree, which was
just at the corner of the wood; I bade him go to the tree,
and bring me word if he could see there plainly what
they were doing: he did so, and came immediately back
to me, and told me that they might be plainly viewed
there; that they were all about the fire, eating the flesh
of one of their prisoners; and that another lay bound
upon the sand, a little from them, whom he said they

would kill next, and which fired the very soul within me. '

He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the
bearded men whom he had told me ofi', who came to
their country in the boat. \I was filled with horror at
the very naming the white-bearded man, and, going to
the tree, I saw plainly by my glass, a white man, who
lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his
feet tied with flags, or things like rushes; and that he was
a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I
was, which, by going a little way about, I saw I might

come at undiscovered, and that then I should be within

half shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though I

was indeed enraged to the highest degree, and going back -'

about twenty 'paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till-I came to the other tree, and then
I came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full
view of them at the distance of about eighty yards.'

I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of the
dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all close huddled
together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the
poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to
their fire; and they were stooped down to untie the
bands at his feet. I turned to Friday: "Now, Friday,"
said I, "do as I bid thee." Friday said he would.
6' Then, Friday," said I, "do exactly as you see me do;
fail in nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and
the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the
like by his; and with the other musket I took my aim
at the savages, bidding him do the like. Then, asking
him if he was ready, he said, "Yes. " "Then fire at
them," said I; and the same moment I fired also. .1
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on
the side that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded
three more; and on my side, I killed one and wounded
two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful con-
stemation; and all of them who were not hurt, jumped
up upon their feet immediately, but did not know which
way to run, or which way to look, for they knew not
from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his
eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might
observe what I did: so as soon as the first shot was made,
' I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece,
and Friday did the like; he sees me cock and present--
he did the same agam ' . "Are you ready, Friday?" said
I... "Yes," says he. "Let fly, then," said I, "in the
: name of God; " and with that yI fired again among the
amazed wretches, and so did Friday y; and as our pieces
,' were now loaded with what I called swan shot, or small
pistol bullets, we found only two drop , but so many were
. wounded, that they ran about yelling and screaming like
' mad creatures, all bloody, and miserably wounded finast
of them; whereof threey more fell quickly after, though
not quite dead. '.

"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged
pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet loaded,
" follow me," saidg I--which he did with a deal oyf courage ,
upon which I rushed out of the wood, and showed my-

self, and Friday close at my foot: as soon as I perceived
' they saw me, I shouted as loud as -I could, and bade
Friday do so too; and running as fast as I could, which,

by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms as .

I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,
as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the
place where they sat and the sea; the two butchers who
were just going to work with him, had left him at the
surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible flight to

the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three '

more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Fri-
day, and bade him step forwards, and fire at them; he
understood me immediately, and, running about forty
yards to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought
he had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on aheap
into the boat--though I saw two of them up again
quickly--however, he killed two of them, and wounded
the third, so that he lay downin the bottom of the boat,
as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and,
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked
him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was? He an-
swered, in Latin, 'C'hriatwnus; but was so weak and faint
that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle
out of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that
he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a piece
of bread, which he ate: then I asked him what country-
man he was ? and he said "Espagnole;"' and, being a
little recoveredplet me know, by all the signs he could
possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his de-
liverance. " Seignor," said I, with as much Spanish as
I could make up, " we will talk afterwards, but we must
fight now; if you have any strength left, take this pistol
and swordrand lay about you :" he took them very

thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, "

but, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon
his murderers like a fury, and had out two of them in
pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole was a
surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much

frightened with the noise of our pieces, that they fell
down for more amazement and fear, and had no more

i . power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had

to resist our shot--and that was the case of those five
that Friday shot in the boat; for as three of them fell

with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with
the fright.

Ikept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being

V ' ' Willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given

the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday,
and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first
fired, and fetch the arms which lay there, that had been
discharged, which he did with great swiftness; and then,
giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load allthe
rest again, and bade them come to me when they wanted.
While I was loading those pieces, there happened a fierce
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who made at him with one of their great wooden swords,
the same weapon that was to have killed him before, if I
had not prevented it: the Spaniard, who was as bold and
as brave as could be iniagined, though weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had cut him-two great
wounds on his head; but the savage being'a stout lusty
fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down (being
faint , and was wringing my sword out his hand, when
the paniard, though undermost, wisely quitting his

. sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage

through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before
I, who was running to help, could come near him; -

.!,- Friday being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying
fwretches with no weaponinhis hand but his hatchet ; and
with that he despatched those three, who, as I said before,
were wounded at first, and fallen, and allthe rest he could
come up with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun,
I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pure
sued two of the savages, and wounded them both; but, -
as he was not able to run, they both got from him into
the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of
them; but the other was too nimble for him; and, though
he was wounded, yet he plunged into the sea, and swam
with all his might off to those who were left in the canoe ,
which three in the canoe, with one wounded, who we
knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped
our hands of one- and- twenty. The account of the restis
as follows:-- <

'8 Killed at our shot from the tree.

2 Killed at the next shot.

2 Killed by Friday in the boat.

2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.

1 Killed by ditto m the wood.

8 Killed by the Spaniard.

4 Killed, being found dropped here and there of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them.

4 Esaaaeid in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not

e

21inall.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out
of gun-shot; and, though Friday made two or three
shots at them, I did not gfind that he hit any of them.
Friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes,
and pursue them; and, indeed, Iwas very anxious about
theirp escape, lest, carrying gthe news home to their people,
they should come back, perhaps, with two or three hun.
dred of their canoes, and devour us by mere multitudes ,
so I consented to pursue them by sea; and, running to
one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow
me; but, when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to
find another poor creature he there alive, bound hand
and foot as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and
almost dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was ,
for he had not been able to look up over the side of the
boat: he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had been
tied so long, that he had really little life in him.

- I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which
they had bound him with, and would have helped him
up p; but he could not stand or speak, but groaned most

iteously, believing, it seems, still that he was only un-

ound in order to be killed. I

g f When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him,
i and tell him of his deliverance; and, pulling out my
'1 :bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which
,3; with the news of his being delivered, revived him, and
4?] he sat up in the boat; but, when Friday came to hear
I him spesfk, and looked' in his face, it would have moved
E "any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him,
2. embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, .hallooed,
I limp ped about, danced, sang, then cried again, wrung
if: s hands, beat his own face and head, and then sang
,6 and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It '
:5 was a good while before I could make him speak to me,
or tellg me what was the matter; but when Phe came a
:little to himde he told me that it was his father.

It was not easy for me to express how it moved me, to
see what ecstacy and filial afiection had worked in this
poor savage, at ythe sight of his father, and of his being
delivered from death; nor indeed can I describe half the
extravagances of his afiection after this; for he went into
[the boat and out of the boat a great many times; when
he went into him, he would sit down by him, op en his
-b,reast and hold his father' 8 head close to yhis bosom, half
.an hour together, to nourish it; then he took his arms
and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the bind-
ing, and chafi'ed and rubbed them with his hands; and
EI, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out
of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great
deal of geod.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
.-.~; with the other savages, who were now gotten almost out
5 of si g:ht and it was happy for us that we did not; for it
. blewg so hard within two hours after, and before they could
be gotten a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so
hard all night, and that from the north- west, which was
against them, that I could not suppose their boat could
live, -or that they ever reached to their own coast. 1

But to return to Friday. He was so busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him ofl
7 'for some time, but after I thought he could leave him
'. f a little, I_ called him to me- and?r he came jumping and
laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. Then I
asked him if he had given his father any bread? He
shook his head, and said, "None: ugly dog eat all up
self." So I gave him a cake of bread out of a little
pouch I-carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for
himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his
father: I had in my pocket, also, two or three bunches of
my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his
father. He had no sooner given his father these'raisins,
but I sawhim come out of the boat, and run away as if

he had been bewitched. He ran at such a rate--for he i
was the swiftest fellow of his feet that ever I saw--I say,
he ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it
were, in an instant; and though I called, and hallooed
too, after him, it was all one: away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found
iis pace was slacker, because he had something in_ his

and. - ' '

. When he came up to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some
freshwater; and that he had got two more cakes, or loaves
of bread. The bread he gave me, but the water he car-
ried- to his father: however, as I was very thirsty too, I r
took a little sup of it. This water revived his father more
than all the rum or spirits I had given him; 'for he was
just fainting with thirst. '

When his father had drunk, I called him, to know if
there was any water left. He said, " Yes; " and I bade
him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much
want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes that
Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very
weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place, under
the shade of a tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff,
and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had -
been tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming
to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took
the bread, and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him
a handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all the
tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear"remap-WW

in any countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding
he hail so exerted himself in the f1 g,ht that he could not

.stand up on his feet; he tried to dog it two or three times,

but really was not able, his ankles were so swelled and'
so painful to him, so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum,as
he had done his father' s.

. I observed the poor aflectionate creature, every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned
his head about, to see if his father was in the same place
and posture as he left him sitting; and at last he found
he was not to be seen: at which he started up ,,and with-
out speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him,
that one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground
as he went, but when he came, he only found he had
laid himself down to ease his limbs: so Friday came back
to me presently and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let
Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat,
and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I
would take care of him; but Friday, a lusty young fel-
low, took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and car-
ried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon
the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the m-
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him close

a to his father, and presently stepping out again, launched

the boat ..off, and paddled it along the shore faster than
I could walk, though the wind blew prett hard too: so
he brought them safe into our creek; an leaving them
in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he
passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he
went ? He told me, " Go fetch more boat: " so away he

Went, like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like
him, and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as

. soon as I got to it by land, so he wafted me over, and

then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which
he did, but theyP were neither of them able to walk; so
that poor Friday knew not what to do.

_ Top remedy this, I went to work' in my thought, and
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while
he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand- barrow to
lay them on, and Friday and I carried them up both to-
gether upon it between us: but when we got them to the
.outside of our wall or fortification, we were at a worse
loss than before; for it was impossible to get.them over,
and I was resolved not to break it down: so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made
a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above .
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our 3
outward fence, and between that and the grove of young 1

'1

I

 

wood which I had planted: and here we made two beds
of such things as I had; namely, of good rice-straw; with
blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them
on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection which
I frequently made, how like a king I looked: first of all,
the whole country was my own mere property, so that I
had an undoubted right of dominion: secondly, my people '
were perfectly subjected; I was absolute lord and law--
giver; they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to
lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for
me ; it was remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and
they were of three different religions. My man Friday
was a Protestant, his father a Pagan and a cannibal, and 7
the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I allowed liberty
of conscience throughout my dominions; but this by the
way. - . . '
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued pris-

oners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest them

upon, I began my think of making some provision for
them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday totake

a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my par-

ticular flock, to be killed: then I cut 011' the hind quarter,

and chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work
to boiling and. stewing, and made them a very good dish,

I assure you, of flesh and broth, having put some barley

and rice also into the broth; and as I cooked it without

doors (for I made no fire within my inner wall), so I

carried it all into the new tent; and having set a table
> there 'for them, I sat down and ate my dinner also with

them: and, as well as I could, cheered them and en-
couraged them, Friday'being my interpreter,-especia]ly
. to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the
deg - Spaniard spoke the language of thep savages pretty well.
. . -PAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday
"to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets
:and other fire-arms, which, forg want of time, we had left
upon the place of battle; and the next day I ordered him
' 'to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay
open to theury sun, and would presently be ofiensive; and
I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast,>> which I knew were pretty much, and
which I could not think of doing my self, nay, I could
not bear to see them, if I went that way :all which he
punctually performed, and defaced the very appearance
of the savages being there; so that when I went again,
I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the
:corner of the wood pointing to the lace.

I then beg an to enter into a little conversation with
my two new gsubjects; and first, I set Friday to inquire
of his father what he thought of the escape of the sav-
ages in that canoe ? and whether we might expect a re-
turn of them with a power too great for us to resist?
His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never
could live out the storm which blew that night they went
' off, but must of necessity be drowned or driven south to
:those other shores, where they were as sure to be de-
voured as they were to be drowned if they were cast
away; but as tyo what they would doif they came safe on
shore, he said he knew noyt; but it was his opinion, that
they were so dreadfully hig hted with the manner of being
attacked, the noise and the fire, that he believed they
.would tell their ppeo 1e they were all killed by thunder
and lightning, and not by the hand of man, and that the
:two which appeared (namely, Friday and I) were two
:heavenly spirits or furies come' down to destroy them,
\ and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew, be-

cause he heard them all cry out so in their langu guage to
one another; for it was impossible for them to conceive
that a man should dart fire. and speak thunder, and kill

at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done
now. And this old savage was in the right r for, as I
understood since, by other hands, the savages of that
. art never attempted to go over to the island afterwards.

hey were so terrified with the accounts given by these

four men (for it seems they did escape the sea , that they-

believed, whoever went to that enchanted is and would
be destroyed with fire from the gods. -

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept al-
ways upon my guard, I and all my army; for, as there
were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a hun-
dred of them fairly in the open field at any time. .

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing,
the fear of their coming wore ofi ; and I began to take
my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into con-
sideration, being likewise assured by Friday's father,
that I might depend upon good usage from their nation
on his account, if I would go.

CHAPTER XVII,

Bur my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a
serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I under-
stood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen
and Portuguese, who, having been cast away,and made
their escape to that side, lived there at peace in-
deed with the savages, but were very sore put to it for
necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the par-
ticulars of their vbyage; and found they were a Spanish
ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna,
being directed to leave their loading there, which was
chiefly hides and silver, and to bring backwhat European
goods they could 'meet with there; that they had five
9Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of
another wreck; that five of their own men were drowned
when first the ship was lost; and that these escaped
through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived al-

. _ imost starved on the cannibal coast, where they expected
. to have been devoured every moment.

He told me they had some arms with them, but they

-were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder
<<(nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their

powder, but a little which they used at their first land-
ing to provide themselves some food.
1 I asked him what he thought would become of them

'there ; and if they had formed no design of making any
Eescape ? He said they had many consultations about it;
but that, having neither vessel nor tools to build one,
.nor provisions of any kind, their counsels always ended
.in tears and despair.

I asked him how he thought they would rece1ve 'a pro-
posal from me, which might tend towards an escape;

'and whether, if they were all here, it might not be done ?

I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery
and ill usage of me, if I put my life in their hands; for
that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature 01

'man ; nor did men always square their dealings by'the

obligations they had received, so much as they did by the
advantages they expected. I told him, it would be very

hard that I should be the instrument of their deliver-
.ance, and that they should afterwards make me their
prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was cer-

tain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what

accident soever, brought him thither; and that 'I had

rather be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless

:claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I
added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all

here, we might, with so many hands, build a bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils south-
Jward or to the islands or Spanish coast northward: but
that if m requital they should, when I had put weapons
into their hands, carry me by force among their own

people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and
~ make my case worse than it was before.'

He answered, with a great deal of candour and' mg e-

Ynuity, that their condition was so miserable, and that

they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would
abhor the thought of using any man linkindly that
should contribute to their deliverance; and'that if I
pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and dis-
course with them about it, and return again, and bring
me their answer: that he would make conditions with
them, upon their solemn oath, that they would be abso-
' lutely under my leading, as their commander and cap-
tain ; and that they should swear upon the holy Sacra-
ments and Gospel to be true to me, and go to such
Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and
to be directed wholly and absolutely by 'my orders, till
they were landed safely in such country as I intended;
and that he would bring a contract from them under
their hands for thatp p.urpose

Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself,
that he would never stir from me as long as he lived, till
I gave him order; and that he would tagke my side to the
last drop of blood, if there should happen the least breach
of faithP among his countrymen.

He told me, they were all of them very civil honest
men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin-
able, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, \
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages--out of
all hop es of ever returning to their own country; and
that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they
would live and die by me.

Up on these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this
Spaniard over to them to treat: but when he had gotten
all thing s in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started
an objection, which had so muchP prudence 1n it on one

hand,J and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I -,

could not but be very well satisfied m it; and, by his
advice, put off the deliverance of has comrades for at least
half a y.ear The case was this:--

He had been with us now about a month, during
which time Ihad let him see in what manner Ihad pro-
vided, with the assistance of Providence, for my support,
and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had
laid up , which, as it was more than sufficient for my-

i self, so it was not sufiicient, at least without good hus-

. bandry, for my family, now it was increased to number
four: but much less would it be sufiicient if his country- ,
men, who were, as, he said, fourteen still alive, should
come over; and least of all would it be sufficient to vic-
tual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to
any one of the Christian colonies of America So he
told me, he thought it would be more advisable to let
him and the other two dig and cultivate some more land,
as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we
should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply
of corn for his countrymen when they should come; for
want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not
to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one
difficulty into another. " You know," says he, f' the
childreny of Israel, though they rejoiced at first at their
being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against
Godg himself, that delivered them, when they came to
want bread 1n the wilderness. "

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good,
that I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal,
as well as I- was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell
to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden toolswe
were furnished with permitted, and, in about a month's
time, by the end of which it was seed- time, we had gotten
as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of
rice, which was, in short, ally the seed We had to spare;
nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley suflicient for our
own food for the six months that we had to expect our
crop, that 1s to say, reckoning from the time we set our
seed aside for sowing , for it is not to be supposed it 18 six
months in the ground in that country.

Having now society enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had
come, unless their number had been very great, we went
freely all over the island, wherever we found occasion ,
and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon Our
thoughts, it was ossible, at least for me, to have the
means of it out of mine. To this purpose, I marked -

 

.-- 'p' a" \H-yv;out several trees which I thought fit for our work, and 1

set Friday and his father to cutting them down; and -

then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my
thoughts on that afi'air, to oversee and direct their work:
I showed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed
a large tree into single planks. and I caused them to do
the like, till they had made about a dozen large planks
of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long g,
and from two inches to four inches thick: what pro-
digious labour it took up, any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could: and to this pur-
pose I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out one day,
and myself with Friday the next day, for we took our
turns; and by this means we got about twenty young
kids to breed up with the rest; for, whenever we shot
the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our 'flock:
but, above all, the season for curing the grapes coming
on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to,be hung up
in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alic'ant, where
the raisins of the sun are cured, we should have filled
sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, were
aogreat part of our food, and very good living too, I as-
sure you; for it is an exceedingly nourishing food.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it
was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the
island; but, however, it was enough to answer our end,
for from twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in
and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels,
and the like in pro (portion of .the rice, which was store
enough for our foo to the next harvest, though all the
sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we
had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully
have victualled our ship, to have carried us to any part
of the world, that is top say, of America. When we had
thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell
to work to make more wicker-work, namely, great bas<<
kets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very
handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me
that I did not make some things for defence, of this kind

of workgbut I saw no need of it. And now, having'a

full supply of food for all the guests expected, I gave the

' Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he .

, could do with those he left behind him there: I gave
him a strict charge in writing not to bring any man
with him, who would not first swear, in the presence of
himself and of the old savage, that he would no way in-

' 'jure, fight with, or attack the person he should find in
the island, who was so kind to send for them, in order to
their deliverancef but that they would stand by and

gr defend him against all such attempts; and, wherever

5.- they went, would be entirely under, and subjected to his
command; and that this should be put in writing, and
signed with their hands: how we were to have this done,
when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, that, indeed,
Was a question which we never asked.

. Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old
savage (the father of Friday) went away in one of the
canoes, which they might be said to come in, or rather

' ' were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be de-

3 ; . voured by the savages.

L v I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it, and

"' ' about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to

be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of
them but upon urgent occasions.

' them go, agreeing with them about a signal they should

that I was right, though, as it proved when I afterwards
examined my account, I found I had kept a true reckon-
ing of years.

It was no less than eight days I waited for them, when
a strange 'and unforeseen accident intervened, of which
the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I
was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, " Mas-
ter, master, they are come, they are come! "

I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I Went out as
soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little
grove--'which, by the way, was by this timeg grown to be
a very thick wood--I say, regardless of danger, I went
without my arms, which was not my custom to do; but
I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I
presently saw a boat at about a league and a half '3 dis-
tance, standing in for shore, with a shoulder-of-muttcn -
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty faintc
bring them in. Also I observedpresently, that they did
not come from that "side which the shore lay on, but from
the southermost end of the island. Upon this I called
Friday in, and bade him he close, for these were not the

people we looked for, and that we did not know yet ~
whether they were friends or enemies.

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and, having
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill,

.as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything,
and to take my view the plainer without being discovered.

I had scarce set my Pfoot on the hill, when myy 6 ye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two
leagues and a half' s distance from me, south-south--east,
but not above a league and a half fi'om the shore. By
my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship,
and the boat appeared to be an English long -boat. '

I cannot express the confusion I was in, gthoug h the
, joy of seeing a ship, and one which I had reason to be-
lieve was manned by my own countrymen, and conse-

quently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet
I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cann'ot tell

~ from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my guard.
7' In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what
"business an English ship could have m that aprt of the
" world; since it was not 1)the way to or from any part of
; the world where the English had any traflic, and I knew
there had been no storms to drive them' 1n there, as in
'f distress; and that if they were English really, it was most "
probable that they were here upon no good design; and
hat I had better ycontinue as I was, than fall into the
hands of thieves and murderers.

'i-Let' no man despise the secret hints and notices of
langer which sometimes are given him, when he may
,- think there 1s no possibility of its being real. That such
hints and notices are given us, I believe few that have
'1 made any observation of things can deny; that they are
.>> certain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse
% of spirits, we cannot doubt, and, if the tendency of them
eems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether
,. upreme, or inferior and subordinate,' 18 not the question),

' and they are given for our good? , '
.. The present question abundantly confirms me in the
- Justice of this reasoning , for had I not been made cau-
3tious by this secret admonition, come from whence it
will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse
ondition than before, as you will see presently.

" I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw
the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a
~ creek to thrust in at for the convenience of landing; .
i however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did
not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts,
but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about
half a mile from me, which was very happy for me; for
otherwise they would have landed just, as I may say, at
my door, and Would have soon beaten me out of my
castle,,and, perhaps, have plundered me of all I had. _
4 When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they.
were Englishmen, at least most of them, one or two' I
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so. There,
were, in all, eleven men, whereof three of them I found' were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound; and when the
\ first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they

took those three out of the boats as prisoners. One of
the three I could perceive using the most passionate ges-

of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up
their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed,
but not to such a degree as the first.

I was pyerfectl confounded at the sight, and knew not
what thep meaning of it should be, ' Friday called out to
me, in English, as well as he could, "Oh, master! you
see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans.'
"Why, " said I, "Friday y, do you think they are going
to eat ythem then '2 " "Yes," says Friday y, "they willeat
them." "No, no," said I, "Friday y; I am afraid they
will murder them indeed; but you may be sure they will
not eat them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter
reall was, but stood trembling 8'with the horror of the
sigh, expecting every moment when the three prisoners-
should be killed, nay ,onee I saw one of the villains lift
up his arm with a great cutlass (as the seamen call it
or sword, to strike one of the poor men, and I exp ecte

 

my body seemed to run chill 1n my veins.

I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the savage
that was gone with him; or that I had any way to have .
come undiscovered within shot of them, ythat I might
have rescued the three men; for I saw no fire- arms they

way.

Xfter I had observed the outrageous usage of the three
men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run
scattering about the land, as if they wanted to see the
country ry. I observed also, that the three other men had
liberty to go where they pleased, but they sat down all . .
three upon the ground very pensive, and looked like men _ "T
in despair. '

This put me in mind of the first time when I came on
shore, and began to look about me; how I gave mysol'

, - ,1 ..

_, over for lost, how wildly I looked round me, what dread-
';. ful apprehensions I had, and how I lodged in the tree all
" night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts.

e: As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to
' receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the
- : land by the storms and tides, by which I have since been
.- so long nourished and supported; so these three poor de-
solate men knew nothing. how certain of deliverance and
supply they were, how near it was to them, and how
effectually and really they were in a condition of safety,
at the same time they thought themselves lost, and their
case desperate.

'5? 80 little do we see before us in the world, and so much
reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great
Maker of the world, that he does not leave his Creatures so
absolutely destitute, but that in the worst circumstances
they have always something to be thankful for, and
sometimes are nearer their deliverance than; they imagine
:--nay,- are even brought to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to be brought to their de-
struction. '

It was just at the top of high water when these people
dame on' shore, and while partly they stood parleying
with the prisoners they brought, and part] while they
rambled about to see what kind of place t ey were in,
they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the
water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat
aground. ' . ' ' -'
94' They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found
afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell
asleep; however, one of them wakened sooner than the
'other, and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir
it, hallooed for the rest who Were straggling about, upon
which they all soon came to the boat; but it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being ve heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft oozy san' , almost
like a quicksand. v i
as In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps,
the least of all mankind given to forethought; they gave
it over, and away they strolled about the country again _;I 'dleam something of their condition. Immediately I

and I heard one of them say aloud to another calling 7
ethem 011' from the boat), " Why, let her alone, J ac can't _'
'ye? she'll float next tide." By which I was fully con-
firmed inthemain mquiry, of what countrymen theywere.

All this while I kept myself close, not once daring to
,--stir out of my castle, any farther than to my plaege of
observation, near the top oyf the hill; and very glad I was
to think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no
less than ten hours before .the boat could be on float again,
and by that time it would be dark, and I might be more
--at liberty to see! their motions, and to hear their dis-
course, if they had any.

In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as
1 before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do
with another kind of enemy than I had at first; I ordered
Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman
with his gun, to load himself with arms--I took myself
two fowling-- -pieces and I gave him three muskets. My
figure, indeed, was very fierce: I had my formidable
goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a
naked sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each,
' shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to havemade
any attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being
the heat of the day, I found that, inshort, they were
all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, ' g
were all laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed , '
men, too anxious for their condition to get any sleep,
were, however, set down under the shelter of a great tree,
' at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought,
out of sight of any of the rest.

Up on this I resolved to discover myself to them, and ,

<<marched in thefigur e above, my man Friday at a good '
distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but
not making'quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did.
I cameas near them undiscovered as I could, and then,
before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them,1n '
Spanish," What are ye, gentlemen? "
They started up at the noise, but were ten times moreconfounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figur

that I made--they made no answer at all, but I thought
I perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke
to them in English: "Gentlemen," said I, "do not be
surprised at me; perhaps you may have a friend near
you, when you did not expect it. " " He must be sent
directly from Heaven, then," said one of them, very
gravely, to me, pulling off his hat at the same time, " for
our condition is past the help of man." " All help is
from Heaven, sir! " said I, " but can you put a stranger
in the way how to help you, for you seem to me to be in
great distress ? I saw you when you landed, and when
you seemed to make application to the brutes that came
with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill y.ou " \
a. The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, " Am ,
I talking to God or man? Is it a real man or an angel? ."
a" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I: " if God had sent
an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed,
and better armed after another manner than you see me
in. Pray, lay aside your fears: I am a man--an Eng lish-
man, and disp osed to assist you; you see I have one
servant onl y--we have arms and ammunition; tell us
freely, can we serve you ? What is your case ? "

V," " Our case," said he, " sir, is too long to tell you while
our murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I was
, 'commander of that ship p; my men having mutinied
against me, they have been hardly prevailed on not to
murder me, and at last they have set me on shore in
this desolate place, with those two men with me, one my
mate, the other a passenger, where we expected to perish,
believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
what to gthinkp of it. "

as " Where are those brutes, your enemies ? " said I,
" do you know where they are gone ? " " There they are, ,
sir," said he, pointing to a- thicket of trees; -" my heart
trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak;
if they have, they will certame murder us all. "- .1>> '
'2!" Have they any fire- arms?" said I. He answered,
" They had only two pieces, and one which they left in
246 use AND wvusruaas or aoemson caosou,
the boa 33; ,5" Well, then," said I, "leave the rest to me;

I see they are asleep; it is an easy thing tokill them all, , H

but shall we rather take them prisoners ? " He told me
there were two desperate villains among them, that it
was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but if they were
secured, he believed all the rest would return to their
duty: I asked him which they were? He told me he
could not at that distance describe them; but he would
obey my orders in anything I would direct; "Well,"
said I, "let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest
they awake, and we will resolve further; " so they will-

em.
" Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your de-
liverance, are you willing to make two conditions with
me 9">> He anticipated my proposals by tellin% me, that

.both he and the ship, 1f recovered, should e wholly

directed and commanded by me in everything; and if
the ship was not recovered, he would live and die with
me in what part of the world soever I would send him;

* and the two other men said the same. '

, , 1' Well," said I, "my conditions are abuttwo: First, _.
,That while you stay on this island with me, you will not
pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms into

'70" hands, you Will upon all occasions give them up to - it":

.me, and do no prejudice to me or mine,'upon this island,
and in the meantime to be governed by orders.:,. Second, -
,That if the ship is, or may be, recovered, you will carry

'me and my man to England, passage free."

<<. He gave me all the assurance that the invention or ,
faith of a man could devise, that he would comply with '
these most reasonable demands; and besides, would owe .
his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as
long' as he lived. , '
_" Well, then," said I, ." here are three muskets for you,

with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is , ~
,proper to be done." He showed all the testimony of his

gratitude that he was able, but offered to be' wholly guided , -
by_ me; I told him I thought it was hard venturing any- '
thing, but thebest method I could think of was, to fire--_-. upon them at once as they lay; and if any were not. .

~ , J _' 'to direct the shot. .

- .1 9" He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill them-
if he could help it; but that those two were incorrigible
villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in
the ship, and, if they escaped, we should be undone still;
for they would go on board, and bring the whole ship's
.~ company, and destroy us all. "Well, then," said I,
"necessity legitimates my advice; for it is the only way
to save Our lives." However, seeing him still cautious
. of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves,

? and manage as they found convenient. . , ' r
In the middle of this discourse, we heard some of them
; awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet.
I asked him if either of them were the men who he had
said were the'heads of the mutiny? He said,"No.>>'.'
"Well, then," said I, "you may let them escape, and
Providence seems to have wakened them on purpose to _
save themselves. Now," said I, "if the rest escape you,
it is your faul ." , .
f'fl'iiAnimated with this, he took the musket I had given
4 him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his two comt
3 rades with him, with each man a piece in his hand; the
' two men who were with him going first, made some
' noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned,
about, and, seeing them coming, cried out to the rest;
but it was too late then, for the moment he cried out
they fired, I mean the two men, the captain .wisely re-
serving his own piece: they had so well aimed their shot
. at the men the knew, that one of 'them was killed on
3?? the spot, and e other very "much wounded; but not
being dead, he started up on his feet and called eagerly ,
for help to the other: but the captain, stepping to him,
:.- told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call
upOn God to forgive his villany; and with that word
. knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so that
,3 he never spoke more: there were three more in the com-
pany, and one of them was also slightly wounded" RIBy
this time I was come; and when they saw their danger,
and it was invain to resist, they begged for mercy. The
captain told them he would spare their lives, if they
would give him any assurance opf their abhbrrence of the
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be
faithful to himin recovering the ship and afterwards 1n
carrying gher back to Jamaica, fromp whence they came.
They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity
that ycould be desired, and he was willing to believe them,
and spare their lives, which I was not against; only I .
obliged him to keep them bound, hand and foot, while'
they were upon the island.

While .this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain' s
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring
away the cars and sail, which they did; and by and by
three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parteyd
from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired,
and seeing their captain, who before was their prisoner,
'now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also--

and so our victo was complete. _
It now remains that the captain and I should in quire

into one another' s circumstances. I beg an first, and told
him my whole history, which he heard with an attention
even to amazement, and particularly at the wonderful
manner of my being furnished with provisions and am-
munition; and, indeed, as my whole story is a collection
of wonders, it aflected him deeply :but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and yliow I seemed to have
been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the
tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more.

After this communication was at an end, I carried him
and his two men into my apartments, leading them 1n
just where I came out, namely, at the top of the house;
where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,
and showed them all the contrivances I had made dur
ing my long, long inhabiting that p.1ace _

v All I showed them, all I said top them, was perfectly
amazing b;ut, above all, the captain admired my forti-- '
ficationg; and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat:7 rams 'ro sneaks THE nurmous renew. 249

with a grove of trees, which, having now been planted
near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster
than-in England, was become a little wood, and so thick
that it was impassable in any part of it, but at that one
side where I had reserved my little winding passage into
it: this I told him was my castle and my residence; but
that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,
whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show
him that the another time; but at present our business
was to consider how to recover the ship. He agreed
with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a
loss what measures to take; for that there were still six-
and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a
cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by des-
peration; and would carry it on, knowing that, if they
were reduced, they should be brought to the gallows as
soon as they came to England, or to any of the English
colonies; and that therefore there would be no attacking
them with so small a number as we were.

, .I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was avery rational conclusion, and that therefore
something was to be resolved on very speedily, as well to
draw the men on board into some snare for their sur-
prise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroy-
ing us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me, that in a
little while the ship's crew, wondering'what was become
of their comrades, and of the boat, would certainly come
on shore in their other boat to seek for them; and that
then perhaps they might come armed, and be too strong
for us: this he allowed was rational. _

,2: Upon this I told him, the first thing we had to do was
to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they
might not carry her off; and taking everything out of
her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim:
accordingly, we went on board, took the arms which were
left on board rout of her, and whatever else we found
there--which was a bottle of brandy and another ,of .
mm, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a great
-, lump of sugar in a piece of oanvass--thesugar was five
Eor' six pounds; all of which was- very welcome to me,

especially the brandy and sugar, of which Ihad had none '
left for many years. 1* - '
When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried before, as
above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if
they had come strong enough to master us, yet they
could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much
in my thoughts, that we could be capable to recover the
ship; but my view was, that if they went away without
the boat, I did not much question to make her fit again
to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon _
our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them
still in my themghts.

CHAPTER XVIII.

Wmu we were thus preparing our designs, and had

first by main strength heaved the>> boat up upon the beach,,;

so high that the tide would not float her ofi' at high water '1
mark, and, besides, had broken a hole in her bottom
too big to be quickly stopped, and were sat down mus-

ing what we should do; we heard the ship fire a gun, and . '

saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signal for
the boat to come on board; but no boat stirred; and they
fired several times,~making other signals for the boat.

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruit.-
less, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them'

. (by the help of our glasses) hoist another boat out, and
-row towards the shore; and we found, as they approached ,
that there were no less than ten men in her, and that
they had fire-arms with them. . '

As. the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we
had a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight
of the men, even of their faces; because the tide having
set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed
:up under shore, to come to the same place where the"

. other had landed, and where the boat lay. . . ' at "H'-e " , summon or THE PRISONERS. 251

>3 By this means, I Say,'we had a full view of them, and

' the captain knew the persons and characters of all the

" memin the boat: of whom he said that there were three

'very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this

conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and fi'ig htened;

but that for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief
oficer among them, and all the rest, they were as out.
rageous as any of the ship' 3 crew; and were, no doubt,

made desperate in their new enterprise, and terribly
apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful
or us

. I smiled at him, and told him,>>that men in our cir-
cumstances were past the operations of fear: that seeing
almost every cendition that could be was better than that
We were supposed to be in, we ought to'expeot that the
consequence, whether death or life, would be sure mm
a deliverance: I asked him, what he thought of the cir-
cumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were
not worth venturing for ? " And where, sir," said I, "is
' your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save
your life, which elevated you a little while ago ? For my
part, " said I, "there seems tobe only one thing amiss in
all the prospect ofit. " "What's that ?"say 8 he.g "Why, "
said I, "'tis that as you say, there are three or four honest
fellows among them, which should be spared; had they
been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should have
thought God's providence had sing led them out to de-
liver gthem into your hands: for, depend upon it, every
man of them that comes ashore are our own, and shall
die or live, as they behave to us. "

2 As I spoke this ywith a raised voice and cheerful coun-
., tenance, I)I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set
vigorously to our business. We had, up on the first ap-

, pearance of the boat's coming from the ship, considered
of separating our prisoners, and had indeed secured them
efiectually. . ,

of: Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured

than ordinary ,I sent with Friday, and one of the three '

(delivered men) to my cave, where they were remote

enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered.
or of finding their way out of the woods, if they could
have delivered themselves: here they left them bound.
but gave them provisions, and promised them, if they
continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a
day or two; but that if they attempted their escape, they
should be put to death without mercy. They promised
faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and
were very thankful that they had such good usage as to
have provisions and a light left them; for Friday ygave
them candles (such as we made ourselves); for their com-
fort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel.
over them at the entrance.
' The other prisoners had better usage: two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was not
free to trust them; but the other two were taken into
my service upon their captain's recommendation, and
upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us ;
so, with them and the three honest men, we were seven
men well armed; and I made no doubt we should be able
to deal well enough with the ten that were a-coming,
considering that the captain had said there were three
or four honest men amongst them also.

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat
lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on
shore, hauling the boat up afterthem, which I was glad to
see '; for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat
atan anchor, some distance from the shore, with some
hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able
to seize the boat.

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all .,
to the other boat; and it was easy to see they were un- ' '
der a great surprise to find her strip p,ed as above, of all
that was in her, and a great hole 1n I'her bottom.
' After they had mused awhile up on this, they set up
two or three great shouts, hallooing with alltheir might,
to try if they could make their companions hear; but all ,
Was to no purpose: then they came all close in a ring,
and fired a volley of their small-arms, which, indeed, we
heard, and the echoes made the woods ring; but it was
all one: those in the cave. we were sure could not hear: 'in claim SEARCH FOR THEIR communes 253 l

and those' 1n our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
? yet durst give no answer to them.
-. They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that,
as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on
board again to their ship p, and let them know there that
the men were all murdered, and the long -boat staved;
accordingly, they immediately launched the boat again,
and got all of them on board.
" The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded
at this, believing they would go on board the ship again,
and set sail, giving their comrades up for lost, and so he
_. should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we
should have recovered; but he was quickly as much
frightened the other way.
' ' They had not been long put off with the boat, but we
". perceived them all coming on shore again, but, with this
new measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they con-
sulted tog ether upon, namely, to leave three men in the
boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the
country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now we
were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those seven
men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the
boat escape, because they would then row away to the
ship; and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh
and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what
the issue of things might present. The seven men came
.on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put
her ofi to a good distance from the shore, and came to
an anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible
- for us to come at them in the boat.
, Those that came on shore kept close together, march-
ing towards the top of the little hill, under which my
habitation lay; and we could see them plainly ,though
they could not perceive us; we could have beeny very glad
they would have come nearer to us, so that we might
have fired at them; or that they would have gone farther
off, that we might have come abroad.
' _l3ut when they were acme to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a great way in the valley and woods,
which lay towards the north- east part, and where the
island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they
were weary; and not caring, it seems, to venture far
from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat down
together under a tree to consider of it. Had they thought
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of them
had done, they had done the job for us; but they were
too full of apprehensions of dang er to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was
they had to fear neither. -

.r The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this
consultation of theirs, namely, that, perhaps, they would '
all fire a volley again to endeavour to make their fellows
hear, and that we should all sally upon them just at the
juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they
would certainly yield and we should have them without '
bloodshed. I liked the proposal, provided it was d0ne_
while we were near enough to come up to them before
they could load their pieces again.

But this event did not happen, and we lay still along
time very irresolute what course to take; at length I told

,them there would be nothing to be done, 1n my opinion,
till night; and then, if they did not return to the boat,
perhaps we might find a way to get between them and
the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them '
in the boat to get them on shore.

We waited a great while, though very impatient PSor
their removing, and were very uneasy , when, after long
consultations, we saw them start all up ,and march down
toward the sea: it seems they had such dreadful ap pre.
hensions upon them of the danger of the place, thatp they '
resolved to go on board the ship again, give their com-
panions over for lost, and so go on with their intended
voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I
imagined it to be, as it really was, that they had given
over their search, and were for going back again; and the ' '
captain, as soon as I had told him my thoughts, was ready
to sink atthe apprehensions of it; butI presently thought ' x

, ._ AM-" .._A' (v.51:_:$.srmucnu ro curves moan on THE canw.' 255

of a stratagem to bring them back again, and which anq
swered my end to a tittlege iv a
'r- I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the
little creek westward, towards the place where the sav- .
ages came on shore when Friday was rescued; and as
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half
a mile's distance, Ibade them halloo as loud as they could,
and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that
as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they 5
should return it again, and then keeping out of sight
take a round, always answering when the others hallooed,
to draw them as far into the island, and among the
2 Woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to me,
by such ways as I directed. . '
They were just going into the boat, when Friday and
the mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and
' answering, ran along the shore westward, towards the
voice they heard, when they were presently stopped by
the creek, where the water being up, they could not get
over, and called for the boat to come up and set them
over, as indeed I expected.

, When they had set themselves over, I observed that
the boat being gone up a good way into the creek, and,
as it were, in a harbour within- the land, they took one
of the three men out of her to go along with them, and
left only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump
of a little tree on the shore.

7 ' This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving
Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took
the rest with me, and, crossing the creek out of their
sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware,
, one of them lying on shore, and the other being in the
boat; the fellow on shore was between sleeping and wak-
ing, and, going to start up, the captain, who was fore.
most, ran in upon him and knocked him down, and then
called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead

man. . . _ . 39.6.1.
1:1 There needed very few arguments to persuade a single
man tqyield, when he saw five men upon him, and his
comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one
. of the three who were not so hearty 1n the mutiny as th
rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not .'
onlyto yield, but afterwards to' Join very sincerely with us '
,- In the meantime, Friday and the captain' s mate so I
well man aged their business with the rest, that they drew '
them, byag hallooing and answering, from one bill to an
other, and from one wood to another, till they not only
heartily tired them, but left them where they were very
sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was ,

, dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves

also by the time they came back to us.

>> We yhad nothing now to do but to watch for them in

the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work :

with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat--and we could hear

the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, .

calling to those behind to come along--and could also

>> hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they

were, and not being able to come any faster, which was
very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is irnposi
sible to express their confusion when they found the boat

' fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed cut, and their
two men gone: we could hear them call to one another
in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they
were gotten into an enchanted island; that either there '
were inhabitants m it, and they should all be murdered;
or else there were devils or spirits in it, and they should '
be all carried away and devoured. LT

They hallooed again, and called their tvm comrades by
their names a great many timm, but no answer:- afte
some time, we could see them,. by the little light there
was, run about wringing gtheir hands, like men in gdespair '

_ and that sometimes they would go and sit down' in the -'

boat to rest themselves, then come ashore, and walk abou

again, and so the same thing over again. I ?,

My men would fain have had me give them leave to >>
fall up On them at once in the dark; but I was willing to:

as few of-them as I could; and especially I was unwilling
to hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the other
men were very well armed: I resolved to wait to see if
_ they did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of
'3 them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet as
close to the ground as they could, that they might not
be discovered, and get as near them as they could pos-
' 'sibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, till the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny,
and had now shown himself the most dejected and dis-
pirited of all the rest, came walking towards them with
two more of the crew; the captain was so eager, at hav-'
mg the principal rogue so much in his power, that he
could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to
be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before;
but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on ytheir feet, let fly at them.

The boatswain was killed up on the spot; the next man
was shot 1n the body, and fell just by him, though he did
not die till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with ,
my whole army, which was now eight men; namely, my-
self, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant- general; the
captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war,
whom we had trusted with arms.

3 We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they
could not see our number; and I made the man they had
left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by
name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so
might perhaps reduce them to terms, which fell out just
as we desired, for indeed it was easy to think, as their
condition then was, they would be very willing to cap it-
ulate ; so he calls out as loud as he could to one of them,
" Tom Smith! Tom Smith! " Tom Smith answered
immediately, " Who's that '2 Robinson ? " For it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered, "Ay, ay ; for
God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and
yield, or you are all dead men this moment."

" Who must we yield to ? where are they .?" says
Smith again. " Here they are," says he; " here is our-
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you
this two hoursy- , the boatswain is killed, Will Fry
wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not yield,
you are all lost. "

"Will they givle us quarter, then ?" says Tom Smith,
"and we willyyi " I'll go and ask, if you promise to
yield,_" says Robinson. So he asked the captain, and the
captain himself then calls out, "You, Smith, you know
In voice; if you lay down your arms immediately and
su mit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins. "

Upon ythis Will Atkins cried out, "For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter! what have I done? they have
all been as bad as I" (which, by the way, was not true
either; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man
that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied,
and used him barbarouisiply, m tying his hands andgi giving 1
him injurious language). However, the captain told him "
he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the
governor's mercy, by which he meant me; for they all
called me governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged
their lives, and I sent the man that had parleyed With
them, and two more, who bound them all; I)and then my
great army of fifty men, which, particularly with those 2
three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon 3
them all, and up on their boat; only that I kept myself a
and one more out of sight, for reasons of state. 1

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of *3
seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he had lei-
sure to parley with them, he expostulated with them upon
the villany of their practices with him, and at length, upon ,
the further wickedness of their design; and how certainly '
it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and ;.
perhaps to the gallows. 2?,'4

They all appeared very penitent, begged hard for their :2_
lives: as for that, he told them they were none of his '
prisoners, but the commander' s of the island; that they
thought they had set him on shore m a barren 1min.

habited island, but it had pleased God so to direct them,

that the island was inhabited, and that the governor was
an Englishman; that he might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but as he hadgiven them all quarter, he sup-
posed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as justice required, except Atkins whom he was
commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for

. death; for that he would be han g'ed 1n the morning.-.

Though this was all fiction ofg his own, yet it had its
desired geffect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life; and
all the rest begg ed of him, for God's sake, that they
might not be sent to Eng land.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy thing
to bring these fellows m to be hearty 1n getting posses.
sion of8 the ship; so I retired in the dark from them,
that they might not see what kind of a governor they
had, and called the captain to me; wheng I called as at
a good distance, one of the men Was ordered to speak
again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the commander
calls for you; " and presently the captain replied," Tell
his excellency I am just a-coming " This more per'-.
fectly amused them: and they all believed that the com-

' mander was just by with his fifty men.

Upon the captain's coming to me, I toldhim myp pro-
ject for seizing the ship p, which he liked wonderfully well,
and resolved to put it in execution the next morning.

. But 1n order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure of success, I told him we must divide the pris-

' oners, and that, he should go and take Atkins, and two

more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to
the cave where the others lay this was committed to
Friday, and the two men who came on shore with the
captain.

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and

' it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their
- 00ndition.

'The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of

which I have given a full description, and as it was__:V ., __...7:>.'rf.,.:,,.----_ . ,---.;.,- _,.

fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,
considering they were upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was
to enter into a parley with them :"in a word, to try them;
and tell me, whether he thought they might be trusted
or no, to go on board, and surprise the ship. 'He talked
to them of the injury done him, of the condition they
were brought to; and that though the governor had given '
them quarter for their lives, as to the present action, yet
that if they were sent to England, they would be all
hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join
in such an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have
the governor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would
be accepted by men in their condition: they fell down
on their knees to the captain, and promised, with the
deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to him
to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to
him, and would go with him all over the world; that
hthey1 would own him for a father to them as long as they

ve . '
, " We ," says the captain, " I must go and tell the gov-
emor what you say, and see what I can do to bringhim
to consent to it." 'So he brought me an account of the
temper he found them in; and that he verily believed
they would be faithful. . .' - , .

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he
should go back again, and choose out five of them, and tell
them, that they should see that they did not want men;
but he would take out those five to be his assistants, and>>
that the governor would keep the other two, and the
three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave),
as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that, if they
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages
should be hanged in chains alive upon the shore. ,4

This looked severe, and convinced them that the gov-

    

 

ernor was in earnest: however, they had no way left but ' I

to accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners,
as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to
do their duty. - . f=7'A'w'ww>>~;u~s'~nw,, :5

ii Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition :

their characters from the captain, I had given their
liberty, and trusted them with arms. .8. The other two

I ' - 'whom I kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, upon

the captain's motion, had now been released. 4. These

five released at last; so that they were twelve in all,

besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with

' these hands on board the ship: for, as for me and my

man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir,
having seven men left behind; {and it was employment
enough for us to keep them as under, and supply them
with victuals. . '. -
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast;
but Friday went twice a-day to them, to supply them

with necessaries; and I made the other two carry pro- -

visions to a certain distance, where Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with
the captain, who told them I was the person the governor
had ordered to look after them, and that it was the gov-
emor's pleasure that they should not stir anywhere but
by my direction; that if they did, they should be fetched
into the castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never
sufi'ered them' to see me as governor, so I now appeared
as another person, and spoke of the governor, the garri-
son, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

' . The captain now had no difiiculty before him, but to
.fiu'nish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man

them: he made his passenger captain of one, .with four
other men, and himself and his mate, and five more, went

in the other; and they contrived their business very well,

for they came up to the ship about midnight. As'soon
as they came within call of the ship, he made Robinson
hail them, and tell them he had brought off the men and
the boat, but that it was a long time before they had '

' found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they
-came to the ship's side; when the captain and the mate,
'entering first with their arms. immediame knocked down
' the'second mate and carpenter with the butt end'of their
muskets. ~ Being very faithfully seconded by their men, ~

they secured all the rest that were upon the main and
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to keep
those down who were below; when the other boat and
their men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the fore-
castle of the ship, and the scuttle, which went down
into the cockroom, making three men they found there
prisoners.

When this was done, and all safe up on the deck, the
captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break into
the round- house, where the new rebel captain lay, and,
~having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and, with two
men and a boy ,had gotten fire- -arms in their hands, and
when the mate withg a crow split open the door, the new
captain and his men fired boldly among them, and
wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which broke his
final, and wounded two more of the men, but killed no-

0

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the
round -house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot
the new captain through the head, the bullets entering at
his mouth, and came out again behind one of his cars,
so that he never spoke a word; upon which the rest
yielded, and the ship was taken efi'ectually without any
more lives being lost.- '

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his success,
'which, you may be sure, I was veryg lad to hear, having
sat watching upon the shore for it gtill near two. of the
clock in the morning.

' Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down;
and it having been a day of great fatiguey to me, I slept very

sound, till Iwas something surprised with the noise of a . -

gun , and presently starting up, urpI heard a man call me by
the name of " Governor, governor!" and presentlyI knew
the captain' s voice; when, climbing gup to the top of the

hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he em?

braced me in his arms: " My dear friend and deliverer l"

>> says he, "there's your ship, for she is all yours, and so
are we, and all that belong to her." I cast my eyes to
the ship and there she rode within a little more than
. half a mile of the shore--for they had weighed her an
, 'chor as soon as they were masters of her--and the weather
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mguth of a littlecreek; and the tide being up, tbecap-
tam had brought the pinnace in near the place where I
first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise;
for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands,
all things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me
away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time,
I was not able to answer one word; but as he had taken
me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have
fallento the ground. ' . : '

5. - He perceived the surprise, and immediawa pulled a
t bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial,
3', which he had brought on purpose for me: after I drank
{, it, I sat down upon the ground, and though it brought
me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak
' ' a word to him. , _
2', All this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy
as I, only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said
L? a thousand kind tender things to me, to compose and
bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy in my
breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion--at last
it broke into tears, and in a little while after I recovered
my speech.
' ' Then I took'my turn, and embraced him as my de-
5' ' liVerer; and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked
>> upon him as a man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and
that the Whole transaction seemed to be a chain of won-
ders; that such things as these were the testimonies we
had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world,
and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite power could '
search into the remotest. corner of the world, and send
help to the rmiserable'whenever he pleased. : v. 32' T
" I forgot not' to lift up my heart in thankfulness 'to
Heaven; and what heart could forbearto bless him, who

"A 5...?had not only in a miraculous manner provided for one i",
in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition,
but from whom every deliverance must always be acknow-
ledg ed to proceed?

'Vthen we had talked awhile, the captain told me, he
had brought me some little refreshments, such as the
ship afi'orded, and such as the wretches who had been so
long his masters, had not plunderedhimOf. Up on this
he called aloud to the boat, and bids his men bring the
things ashore that were for the governor; and indeed
it was a present as if I had been one, not that I was to
be carried along with them, but as if I had-been to dwell
upon the island still, and they .were to go without me.

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of ex-
cellent cordial waters; six large bottles of Madeira wine,
the bottles held two quarts a-piece; two pounds of excel-
lent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef,
and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and Pabout a
hundred weight of biscuit.

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour,a
bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime Juice, and
abundance of other things: but besides these, Jand what .
was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me 'f
six clean new shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair '
of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stock-
ings, and averyg good suit of clothes of his own, which
had been worn but very little. In a word, he clothed
me from head to foot. ,

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one
may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was
anything 1n the world of that kind so unpleasant, awk-
ward, and uneasy, as it was to me to wear such clothes
at their first putting on.

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we beg an
to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had,
for it was worth considering whether we might venture
to take them away with us or no, especially two of them,
whom we knew to be' mcorngi ble and refractory to the last
degree, and the captain said, he knew they were such

trogues, that there was no obligin g;them and if he did
carry them away, it must be m iron: as malefactors, to be
delivered over to Justice at the first English colony he could
come at; and I found that the captain himself was very
anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I durst
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it

their own re quest that he should legve them upon the

island. "I should be very glad of tha ," says the cap-
tain, "with all my heart."

" Well," said I, " I will send for them, and talk with
them for you :" so I caused Friday and the two hostages
---for they were now discharged, their comrades having
performed their promise--I say, Icaused them to go to the
cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were,
to the bower, and keep them there till I came.

After some time, I came thither dressed in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being all
met, and the captain With me, I caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them, I had had a full ac-
count of their villanous behaviour to the captain, and
how they had run away with the ship, and were pre-
paring to commit further robberies; but that Providence
had ensnared them 1n their own ways, and that they were
fallen into the pit which they had digg ed for others.

-I let them know, that by my direction the ship had
been seized, that she lay now in the road, and they might
see by and by, that their new captain had received the
reward of his villany; for that they might see him hang-
ing at the yard-arm: that as to them, I wanted to know
what they had to say ,ywh I should not execute them as
pirates taken m the fact, as by ymy cOmmission they could
not doubt I had authority to do.

One of them answeredy 1n the name of the rest, that
they had nothing to say but: this, that when they were
taken, the captain promised them their lives, and they
humbly implored my mercy: but I told them I knew not
what mercy to show them; for, as for myself, I had re-

solved to quit the island with all my men, and had taken _

passage with the captain to go for England :. and, as for
the captain, he could not ca them to England, other
than as prisoners in irons to e tried for mutiny, and
running away with the ship, the consequence of which,
they must needs know, would be the gallows; so that I
could not tell what was the best for them, unless they had
a mind to take their fate' in the island: if they desired
that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it: I had
some inclination to give them their lives, if they thought
they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful
for it; said they would much rather venture to stay there,
than to be carried to England to be hanged: so I left it
on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difliculty
of it, as if he durst not leave them there: upon this, I
seemed to be a little angry with the captain, and told him,
that they were my prisoners, not his, and that, seeing I
had ofiered them so much favour, I would be as ggood as
my word; and that if he did not think fit to consent to
it, I would set them at liberty as I found them; and, if
he did ndt like that, he might take them again if he
_ could catch them.

' Up on this, they appeared very thankful, and I accord-
ingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the
woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave
them some fire- -arms, some ammunition, and some direc--

tions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. '

Up on this, I yprepared to go on board the ship ,but told

the captain that I would stay that night to prepare my

figs; and desired him to go on board" in the meantime,

eep allright m the ship, and send the boat on shore

the next day for me: ordering him, in the meantime, to

cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at
\the yard-arm, that these men might see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to '

me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse

with them of their circumstances. I told them, I thought - '

they had made a rig ht choice: that, if the captain carrgied
them away, they would certainly be hang ed; I showed
them their captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect.

~ When 'they all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them I would let theminto the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them: accordingly, I gave them the>> whole history of the
place, and of my coming to it; showed them my forti-
fications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn,

cured my grapes: and, in a word, all that was necessary

to make them easy. I told them the story of the six-
teen Spaniards that were to [be expected; for whom I
left a letter, and made them promise'to treat them in
commOn with themselves. , y,

I left themmy fire-arms, namely, five muskets, three
fowling-pieces, andthree swords: I had about a barrel

. of powder left; for after the first year or two I used but

little, and wasted none. I gave them a description of
the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, to make both butter and cheese.

In a word, I gave them every part of my own story'
and I told them I would prevail with the captain to
leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some
garden-seed, which I told them I would have been very
glad of ; also I gave them the bag of peas which the cap-
tain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to
sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on board the ship; we prepared immediately to
sail, but did not weigh that night. The next morning
early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship's
side, and, making a most lamentable complaint of the
other three, begged to be taken into the ship for God's
sake, for they should be murdered; and begged the cap-
tain to take them on board, though he hanged them im-
'mediately.

Upon this, the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but, after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped and
pickled; after which they proved very honest and quiet

. fellows.

the tide being up, with the things promised to the men, ' '

to which the captain, at my intercession, caused their
chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and

were very thankful for: I also encouraged them, by tell- -

ing them, that if it lay in my way to send a vessel to
take them in, I would not forget them.

CHAPTER XIX.

Wm I took leave of this island, I carried on board for

relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, ,

and one of my parrots; also, I forgot not to take the
money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so
long useless that it was grown rusty, or tarnished, and
could hardly pass for silver, till it had been a little rubbed
and handled; and also the money'I found in the wreck
of the Spanish ship. I

And thus I left the island the 19th day of December,
as I found by the ship's account, in the year 1686,'after
I. had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days; being delivered from the second
captivity the same day of the month that I first made

my escape in the barcolongo from among the Moors of '

Sallee. ~ , , . a -

In this veesel, after along voyage, I arrived in Eng-
land the 11thof June, in the year 1687, having been
thirty and five years absent. , ,

When I came to England, I was a perfect stranger to
all the world, as if I had never been known there: my

benefactor, and faithful steward, whom I had left in trust V

with my money,'was alive, but had had great misfortunes
in the world, was become a widow the second time, and
very low in the world. I made her easy as to what she
owed me, assuring her, I would give her no trouble; but,
on the contrary, in gratitude to her former care and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would

afiord, which at that time, would, indeed, allow me. to

' 'do but little for her; but I assured her, I would never
forget her former kindness to me; nor did I forget her
when I-had sufficient to help her, as shall be observed
in its place. - '

"I went down afterwards into Yorkshire, but my father
was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, ex-
cept that I found two sisters, and two of the children of
one of my brothers: and as I had been long ago given
over for dead, there had been no provision made for me;

- 'so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist

2 me, and that little money I had would not do much for

x. me as to settling in the world.

3 I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did

a not expect; and this was, that the master of the ship

E whom I had so happily delivered, and by the same means

E saved the ship and cargo, having given every handsome

; account to the owners of the manner how I had saved

f the lives of the men, and the ship,.they invited me to

3" meet them and some other merchants concerned, and all

i together made me a very handsome compliment upon

1 'that subject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds

3 sterling.

: But after making several reflections upon the circum-

g stances of my life, and how little way this would go to-

, wards me settling in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon,

7 and see if I might not come by some information of the '
state of my plantation in the Brazils, and what was be-
come of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had

'5' some years now given me over for dead. .

~~ With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I

. arrived in April following, my man Friday accompany-

- . , ing me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving

, ', a most faithful servant upon all occasions.

When I came to Lisbon, Ifound out, by inquiry, and

to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the captain

' of the ship, who first took me up at sea 011' the shore of

' Africa: he was now grown old, and had left off the sea",

5 having put his son, who was far from a young man, into

g; his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old

; "- man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly knew him ;

\270 Liraasn invnxrunas or nonmeon'auson.

but I soon brought myself to his remembrance when I,

told him who I was.

After some passionate expressions of our old acquaint-3
ance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation -

an my- partner. The old man told me he had not been
in the Brazils for about nine years; but that he could
assure me that, when he came away, my partner was
living, but the trustees, whom I had joined with him to
take cognisance of my part, were both dead; that, how-
ever, he behaved that I would have a very good account
of the improvement of the plantation, for that, upon the
general belief of my being cast away and drowned, my
trustees had given in the account of the produce of my
part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had
appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one-
third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St
Augustine, to be expended for the benefit 'of the poor,
and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic
faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim
the inheritance, it would be restored, only that the im'

provement, or annual production, being distributed to~

charitable uses, could not be restored; but he assured
me that the steward of the king's revenue (from lands),
and the provedore, or steward of the monastery, had
taken great care all along that the incumbent, that is to
say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account of
the produce, of which they received duly my moiety.

I asked him, if he knew to what height of improvement
he had brought the plantation ; and whether he thought
it might be worth looking after; or whether, ommy going
thither, I should meet with no obstruction to my possess-
ing my just right in the moiety. .

He. told me, he could not tell exactly to what degree
the plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my
partner was growing exceedingly rich upon the enjoying
but one-half of it: and that, to the best of his remem-
brance, he had heard that the king's third of my part,
which was, it seems, granted away to some other mon-
astery, or religious house,- amounted to above two hundred
moidores a-year ; that, as to my being restored to a quiet

"maxi

" ' possession of it, there was no question to be made of that,

my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name
being also enrolled in the register of the country. Also
he told me, that'the survivors of my trustees were very
fair, honest people, andveryewealthy; and he believed I

I . would not only have their assistance for putting me in

possession, but'would find a very considerable sum of
money in their hands for my account, being the produce
of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before
it was given up, as above, which, as he remembered, was ,7
about twelve years. \

I- showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this
account, and inquired of the old captain how itcame to
pass, that the trustees should thus dispose of my efi'ects,

' when he knew that I had made my will, andhad made

him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.

He told me that was true; but that, as there was no
proof of my being dead, he could not act as executor
until some certain account should come of my death ; and

- that, besides, he was not willing to' intermeddle with a

thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my
will and put in his claim; and could he, have given any
account of my being dead or alive, he would have acted
by my procuration, and taken possession of the ingeino so
they called the sugar house), and had given his son, w o
was now at the Brazils, order to do it.

"But," says the old man, " I have one piece of news
to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to
you asthe rest, and that is, that behaving you were lost,
and all the wOrld behaving so also, your partner and

trustees did offer to account to me, in your name, for

six or eight of the first years of profit, which I received;
but there beingsat that time," says he, "great disburse-
ments for increasing the Works,- building an ingeino, and
buying slaves, it did not, amount to near so much as
afterwards it produced; however," says the old man, "I
shall give you, a true account of what I have received in
all, and how I have disposed ofi ." ,

fi'iend, he brought mean account of the six first. yem'w-w-uv "w

income of my plantation, signed by my partner and the,

merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods',
namely, tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum,
molasses, &c., which is the consequence of a sugar-work;
and I found by this account, that every year the income

considerably increased: but, as above, the disbursement

being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old
man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred
and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests ofisugar,
and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost m his
ship, he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon,
about eleven years after my leaving the place.

The good man then began to complain of his misfor-
tunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of my
money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a
new ship. "However, my old frien, y" says he, " you
shall not want a supply 1n your necessity, as soon as my
son returns, you shall be fully satisfied."

Up on this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me two
hundred Portugal moidores' in gold; and giving gme the
writings of his 8title to the ship which his son was gone
to the Brazils in, of which he was a quarterp art owner,
and his son another, he puts them both 1n my hands for
security of the rest-

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness
of the poor man, to be able to bear this, and, remem-
bering what he had done for me, how he had taken me
up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all
occasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was

now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he .

said to me; therefore, first, I asked him if his circum-
stances admitted him to spare so much money at that
time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me, he
could not say but it might straiten him a little, but,
however, it was my money, and I might want it more
than he.

Everything the good man said was full of afi'ection, and
I could hardly refrain from tears while he sp.oke In
short, .I. took one hundred of the moidores, and 81)called for
a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them; then I re-MEANS 'ro Rucovna TEE nmzms PLANTATION. 273

turned him the rest, and told him, if ever I had posses-

sion of the plantation, I would return the other to him

.also, as indeed I afterwards did, and that, as to the bill
:of sale of his part' in his son' s ship, I would not take it

by any means, I)but that if I wanted the money ,I found
he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but
came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I
would never have a penny more from him. . s .
When this was past, the old man beg an to ask me, if

.he should put me on a method to make my claim to my

plantation.P I told him, I thought to go over to it my self.
He said, I might do so if I pleased, bgut that if I did not,
there were ways enough to secure my right, and im-
mediately to appropriate the profits to my use; and as-
there were ship s in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go
away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with this afiidavit, affirming up on oath fhat I
was alive, and that I was the same person who took up
the land for the planting the said plantation at first.

This being regularly attested by notary, and a pro-

curation afiixed, he directed me to send it with a letter
of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the
place; and then proposed my staying withhim till an ac-
count came of the return.
-- Never anything was more honourable than the pro-
ceedings upon this procuration; for in less than seven
months, I received a large packet from the survivors of~
my_ trustees, the merchants, on whose account I went to
sea, in which were the following particular letters and
papers enclosed: --

First, There was the account current of the produce
of my farm, or plantation, fiom the year when their
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain, being
for .six years; the balance appeared to be one thousand
one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.

Secondly, There was the account of four years more
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the
government claimed the administration, as being the
efiects of a person not to be found which they call civil
death; and the balance of this, the value of the planta-

s274 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

tion increasing, amounted to three thousand two hundred,
and forty-one moidores.

Thirdly, There was the prior of the Angus tine' s ac-
count, who had received the profits for about fourteen
years; but not being able to account for what was dis-

osed to the beep ita1,g very honestly declared he had eight
hundred and seventy-two moidoresy not distributed, which
he acknowledged to my account. As to the king's part,
that refunded nothing.

There was also a letter of my partner' s, congratulat-

ing me very afi'ectionately upon my being alive; giving
me an account how the estate was improved, and what
it produced a- year, with a particular of the number of
squares, or acres, that it contained, how planted how
many slaves there were upon it; and, making two-and:
twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many
Ave Matias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive ,
inviting me very passionately to come over and take pos-
session of my own, and in the meantime to give him
orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his
friendship, and that of his family; and sent me as a pre- ~
sent, seven fine leopard skins, which he had, it seems,
received from Africa by some other ship which he had
sent thither; and who, it seems, had made a better voy-
age than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent
sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not
quite so large as moidores. '

_ By _the same fleet my merchant-trusteet shipped me
twelve hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of
tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of
Job was better .than the beginning. It is impossible to
express the flutterings of my yvery heart, when I looked
over these letters, and especially when I found all my
wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships came all m
fleets, the same ship s which brought my letters brought
myg oods; and thep effects were safe' 1n the Tagu s before
the letter came to my hand. In a' word, I turned- pale,g
and grew sick, and had not the old man run and fetched- .. ""'5"'<?WC*37"'_""' val-nus:

- . Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some
+hours,'till'a physician being sent for, and something of
the real'cause of my illness being known, he ordered me
to be let blood, after which I had relief, and grew well;

:but I verily believe, if it had not been eased by the vent

given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died.
. I was now master, all on a sudden, of above fifty thou-
sand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I
might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand
pounds a-year, as sure as an estate of lands inEngland ;
and, in a word,'I was in a condition which I scarce knew
how to understand, or how to compose myself for the en;-

The first thing I did was to recompense" my original
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the be-
ginning, and honest tone at the end. I showed him
all that was sent to 'me; I told him, that, next to the '
providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him,
which I would do an hundred fold. So I first returned
to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then
I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release or discharge for the four hundred and seventy
,moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me', inthe
fullest and firmest manner possible, after which I caused
a proouration to be drawn, empowering him to be my re-
ceiver of the annual profits of my plantation, and appoint-
ing my partner to account to him, and make the returns
by the usual fleets to him in my'name ; and a clause in
the end, being a grant of one hundred moidores a-year to
him during his life, out of the effects; and fifty moidores
a-year to his son after him, for his life. And thus I re-
quited my old man. -' ;-'

276 LIFE 'AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

_,in the island, where I wanted nothing but what I had,
and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now
a great change upon me, and my business was how to
secure it: I had never a cave to hide my money in, or a
place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew
mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with
it. On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom
to trust with it; my old patron,.the captain, indeed, was
honest, and that was the only refuge I had.

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed
to summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to
think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, and
left my effects in some hands behind me. At first. I
thought of my old friend the widow, who, I knew, was
honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in
years, and but poor, and for aught I knew, might be in
debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my effects with .me.

I was some months, however, before I resolved upon
this; and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain
fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my former bene-
factor, so I began to think of my poor-widow, whose
husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it
was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor.
So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write
to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill,
but to go find her out, and carry her in money a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her
in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have

a further supply. At the same time, I sent my two sisters '

in the country, each of them ahundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances
--one having been married, and left a widow; and the
other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be'.

But among allmy relations or acquaintances, I. could
not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross
of myistock, that I might go' away to the Brazils,.and leave
things safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.- :-

I had once a mind to have gone to the ,Brazils, and
have settled myself there, forI was, as it_were,naturalised

sauna LETTERS TO THE BRAZILS. 277

to the place; butIhad some little scru pleinmy mind about
religion, which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall
say more presently. However, it was not religion that

' kept'me from going thither for the present; and as I had

made no scruple of being openly, of the religion of the
country, all the while I was among them, so neither did I
yet; only that now and then, having of late thought more
of it than formerly, when I began to think of living and
dying among them, I began to regret my havingg pro-
fessed my self a Papist, and thought it might not be the
best religion to die in.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that
kept me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did
not know with whom to leave my effects behind me; so
I resolved at last to go to England with them, where, if
I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance,
or find some relations, that would be faithful to me; and
accordingly I prepared to go for England with all my
wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first
(the Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved to give
answers suitable to the] net and faithful account of things
I had from thence; and first, to the prior of St Augus-
tine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings,
and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moi~
dores, which were undisposed of, which I desired might be
given, five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior shOuld direct,
desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and the like.

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with
all the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty
called for; as for sending them any present, they were
far above having any occasion of it.

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledgin ghis' m-
dustry 1n the improving gthe plantation, and his integrity
in increasing the stock of the works; giving ghim instruc-
tions for his future government of my part according
to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I
desired him to send whatever became due to me,- till he
should hear from me more particularly; assuring him,
that it was my. intention, not only to come to him, but
to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To
this I added a very handsome present of some Italian
silks for his wife and two daughters--for such the cap-
tain's son informed me he had--with two pieces of fine
English broad-cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five
pia'elces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good
v ue. ' , V

Having thus settled my afl'airs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next
difficulty was, which way to go to England. I had been
accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange
aversion to go to England by sea at that time: and
though I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty
increased upon me so much, that though I had once
shipped "my baggage in order\to go, yet I altered my
mind, and that not once, but two or three times. '

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons. But let no man slight
the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such
moment. Two of the ships which I had singled out to
go in--I mean more particularly singled out than any
other, thatis to say, so as in one of them to put my
things on board, and in the other to have agreed with
the captain--I say, two of these ships miscarried, namely,
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast
away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people
drowned except three; so that, in either of these vessels,
I had been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot, to whom I communicated everything, pressed me
earnestly not to .go by sea; but either to go by land to
the Groyn'e, and cross over the Bay of Biscayto Rochelle,
from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land
to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to
Madrid, and so all the way by land through France.

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by
sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved
to travel all the way by land : which, as Iwas not inhaste,

and did not ,value the charge, was by much the pleas~
anter way ; and to make it more so, my old captain brought
an English gentleman, the. son of a merchant in Lisbon,
who was willing to travel with me; after which, we picked
up two who were English, and merchants also, and two
young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going toParis only:
so that we were in all six of us, and five servants, the
two merchants and the 'two Portuguese contenting them-
selves with one servant between two, to save the charge;
and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me
as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a
stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant
upon the road.

In this>> manner I set out from Lisbon: and our com-
pany being all very well mounted and armed, we made a
little troop, whereof they did me the honour to call .me
captain, as well because I was the oldestman, as because
I had two servants, and indeed was the original of the
whole journey. _ '

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals,
so shall I trouble you with none of my land journals.
But some adventures that happened to us in this tedious
and diificult journey, I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers
to Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court
of Spain, and to see what was worth observing; but it
being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away;
and set out from Madrid about the middle of October:
But when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were
alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an account
that so much snow was fallen on the French side of the
mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come
back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an ex-
treme hazard, to pass on. .

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so
indeed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot
climate, and indeed to countries where we could scarce
bear any clothes on, the cold was insufierable; nor, in-'
deed, was it more painful than it was surprising ;_ to come
but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the weather
was'not only warm, but very hot, and immediately to
feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen,
so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes, was
very strange. .
, Poor Friday was really frighted when he 'saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather,
which he had never seen or felt before in his life. -
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampel'una, it
continued snowing with so much violence, and so long,
that the people said winter was come before its time;
and the roads, which were diflicult before, were new quite
impassable: in a word, the snow lay in some places too
thick for us to travel; and bein not hard frozen, as is
the case in northern countries, t ere was no going with-
out being in danger of being buried alive every step. We

staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna: when

(seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe
that had been known in many years I proposed that we
should all go awayto Fontarabia, an them take shipping
for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage.

.But while we were consideringthis, there came infour
French, gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the
French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish,
had found out a guide, who, traversing the country near
the head of- Languedoc, had brought them over the moun-
tains by such ways, that they were not much incommoded
with the snow; and where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough, to hear
them and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would under-
take to carry us the same way with no hazard from the
snow, provided We were armed sufiiciently to protect us
from wild beasts: for, he said, upon these great snows,
it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at
the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want
of food, the ground being covered with snow. We told
him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as
they were, if he would ensure us fiom a kind of two-legged

'3; ' wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from,
i_ ' especially on the French side of the mountains.

- V He satisfied us there was no danger of that kindin the
way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow
him; as did also tWelve other gentlemen, with their ser
vants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had
attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna, with our
guide,,on the 15211 of November; and indeed I was sur-
}, ' rised, when, instead of going forward, he came directly

back .with us, on the same road that we came from Mad-
rid, about twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers

and come into the plain country, we found Ourselves in a

warm climate again, where the country was pleasant and
no snow to be seen; but on a sudden, turning to the left,
he approached the mountains another way; and though,
it is true, the hills and the precipices looked dreadfully,
yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by
such winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of the
mountains, without being much encumbered with the
snow; and all on a sudden he 'showed us the pleasant

fruitful- provinces of Languedoc and Grascoigne, all green .

and flourishing; .though indeed they were at a great dis-
. tance, and we had some rough way to pass yet.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it
snowed one whole day and a right, so fast that we could
not travel; but he bade us be easy, we should soon be
past it all. We found, indeed, that we began to descend
every day, and to come more north than before; and so,
depending upon our guide, we went on. ' '

It was about two hours before night when our guide,
being something before us, and not just in sight, out
rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear,
out of a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood. Two of
the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he been half a
mile before us, he had been devoured indeed, before we
could have helped him; one of them fastened upon his

is horse, and the other attacked the man with that violence,
that he had not time, or not presence of mind enough, to
draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.
My man Friday being next to me, I bade him ride up ,and
see ywhat was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight
of the man, he hallooed as loud as the other, " Oh master !
0h master! "--.--but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up
to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked '
him in the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he, having been used to that kind .of creature
in his country, had no fear upon him, but went close up
to him and shot him as above; whereas any of us would
have fired at a farther distance, and perhaps either missed
the wolf, or endangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified abolder man than
I, and indeed it alarmed all our c6'mpany, when, with the
noise of Friday' s pistol, we heard on both sides the dis-
malest howlings of wolves, and the noise redoubled by
the echo of the mountains, that it was to us as if there
had been a prodigious multitude of them, and perhaps,
indeed, there was not such a few as that we had no cause
of apprehension.

aldowever, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that had fastened upon the horse, left him immediately,
and fled, having happily fastened upon his head, where
the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth, so that he
had not done him much hurt: the man, indeed, was most
hurt; for the raging creature had bithim twice, onceon
the. arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and
he was just as it were tumbling down by the disorder of the
horse when Friday came up and shoty the wolf.

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the
way (which was very difficult) would give us leave to see
what was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the
trees which blinded us before, we saw plainly what had
been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor
guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of
creature it was he had killed.A sum cones our or rim more. 283: '

  

, CHAPTER XX.
id ; '
Bur never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such
a surprising manner, as thatwhich followed between Fri-
day and the bear, which gave us all (though at first we
were surprised and afraid for him) the greatest diversion
imaginable. ., As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature,
and does not gallop as thewolf does, which is swift and-
light, so he has two particular qualities, which generally
are the rule of his actions; first, as to men,.who are not
his proper prey--I say, not his proper prey, because,
though I can't say what excessive hunger might do, which
was nowtheir'case, the ground being all covered with
snow}; yet as to men, he does not usually attempt them,
unless they first attackhim ; on the contrary, if you: meet
him in the woods, if you don't meddle with him, he Won't
meddle with you: yet then you must take care tolbe very
civil to him, and gave him the road, for he is a very nice
gentleman; he won't go a step out of the way for a prince
----nay, if you are really afraid, yOur best way is to look
another way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if you
stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes
it for an affront, and if you throw or toss anything at him,
and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as
your finger, he takes it for an affront, and sets all other
business aside to pursue his revenge; for he will have
satisfaction in point of honour, and this is his first qualityh'
the next is, that if he be once aflront'ed, he'will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but fol-
low at a good round rate till he overtakes you.

My man Fridayhad delivered our guide, and when we
came-up to him, he was helping him ofi' from his horse;
for thevman was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the
last more than the first; when, on a sudden, we espied
the bear come out of the wood, and a very monstrous one
it was, the biggest by .far that ever I saw. rWe were all
a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow'scountenance: "Oh! Oh! Oh!" says Friday, three times.
pointing to him, " Oh master! you give me te leave, me
shakes te hand with him, me makee you good laugh."

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased: " You fool
you," said I, " he will eat you up! " " Eatee me up I eatee
me up!" says Friday twice over again; "me eatee him
up ; me make you good laugh ; you all stay here, me show
you good laugh." So down he sits, and gets his boots

off in a moment, and put on a pairvof pumps(as we call _

the flat shoes they wear), and which he had in his pocket,
and gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun
away he flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle
with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him,
as if the bear could understand him: "Hark ye! hark
ye! " says Friday, " me speakee wit you." We followed
at a distance ; for now being come down to the Gascoigne
side of the mountains, we were entered a vast great forest,
where the country was plain, and pretty open, though
many trees in it scattered here and there. '

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear,
cameup with him quickly, and takes up a great stone, and
throws it at him, and hit .him just on the head, but did
him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a
wall: but it answered Friday's end; for the rogue was
so void of fear, that he did it purely .to make the bear
follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called it.

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he
turns about, and comes after him,'taking devilish long
strides, and shufiiing along at a strange rate, so as he
would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for
help; so we all'resolved to fire at once upon the bear,
and deiiver my man, though I was angry at him heartily
for bringing the hear back upon us, when he was going.
about his business another way, and especially I was
angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run
away; and I called out, "You dog," said I, "is this
your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your horse,
that we may shoot the creature." He hears me, and cries

:- out," No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much
' ' laugh: " and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the
beast's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and
Seeing a great oak tree fit for hisp urpose, he beckoned
us to follow, and, doubling his pace, he gets nimbly yup
the tree, layin ghis gun down upon the ground, at about

five or six yards from the bottom of the tree.
~ The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at
-a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the
gun, smelled to it, but let it lie, and up he scrarhbles
into the tree, climbing like a cat; though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of
my man, and could not for my life see anythingg to laugh
at yet, till, seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode

nearer to him.
' When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out

to the small of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got
about half way to him. As soon as the bear got outg to
that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, " Ha,"
says he to us, "now you see me teaches the bear dance" ,
so he falls 11-] ump ing and shaking the bong h, at which
the bear, beg an to totter, but stood. still, and beg an to
look behindg him, to see how he should get back: gthen,
indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done
with him by a great deal: when he sees him stand still,
he calls out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear
could speak English," What! you come no farther?
_Pray you come farther.' So he left' Jumping gand shak-
ing the bong h: and the bear-,3 ust as if he understood ,
what he said, did come a little farther; then he fell
a- -jumping again, and the bear stopped ag.ain

mWe thought now was a good time to knock him on the
head, and failed to Friday to stand still, and we would
shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly," Oh, pray!
Oh, pray y! no shoot, me shoot by and then"---he would
have\said by and by y. However, to shorten the story,
Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish,
that we had laughing enough, indeed, but still could not
imagine what the fellow would do. for first we. thought
he depended .upon shaking the hear of, and We found the' 359-25

' bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not get
out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fast with
his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not im-
agine what would be end of it, and where the jest would
be at last.

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for, seeing
the bear cling yfast to the bong h, and that he would not be
persuaded tog come any farther," Well, well," said Fri-
day, " you no come farther, me go, me go; you no come
to me, me come to you;" and up on this he goes out to
the smallest end of the bong h, where it would bend with
his weight, and gently letsg himself down/by it, sliding
down the bong h till he came near enough to Jump down
on his feet; and away he ran to his gun, takes it up,
and stands still.

"We, " said I to him, " Friday, what will you do
now ? Why don't you shoot him '2" " No shoot ,"says
Friday, " no yet, me shoot now me no kill; me stay,

give you one more laugh. " And, indeed, so he did, as i

you will see presently , for when the bear saw his enemy
' gone, he comes back from the hon gh where he stood, but
did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every step,
and coming backward till hog got into the body of the
tree; then,g with the same binder and foremost, he came
down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving
one foot at 'a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and
just before" he could put his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped close to. himLclapped the'xmuzzle of his
piece into his ear, and shot him as dead; as a stone. - '
Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not lau g;h
and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls
'a- lau ghing himself very loud--" So we kill bear in my
jcountgry," says Friday. " So you kill them?" said I;

"' why, you have no guns." " yNo," says he, " no guns, .

but shoot great much long arrow. "

This was, indeed, a good diversion to ums; but we were
still in a wild place, and our guide very hurt, and
what to do we I)hardly knew: the howling wolves ran
much in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once
heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said some-

thing already, I never heard anything that filled me with

' so' much horror; ' - _,

These things, and the approach of night, called us of,
or else; as 'Friday'would have had us, we should cer- '
.tainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off,
5which was Worth saving ; but we had three leagues to go',
and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went

The ground was still covered with show, though not
so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the
ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come
down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hun-
ger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mis-
chief in the villages, where theytsurprised the' country
people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and
some people too. ' '

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the coun-
try, we should find them there; andthis was a small
plain, surrounded Vp'th woods on every side, and a long
narrow defile or lane, which we were to pass to get through
the wood, and; then we should come to the village where
_we were to lodge;

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered
the first wood, and a little after sunset when we came into
the plain. We met with nothing in the first wood,,.ex-
oept that in a little plain within the wood, which was not
'above two furlongs~over, we saw five great wolves cross
the road, full speed one after another, as if they had been
in chase of some prey, and had it in View: they took no
'notice of 'us, and were gone and out of sight in a few
moments.'? ', '
~45 Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was {gwretched
faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready posture ; for
he behaved there were more wolves a-coming. . L
'3? We' keptvou'r arms-ready, and our eyes about 'us; but
we saw no 'more wolves till we came through that wood,
{which was near half a'le'ague', and entered the plain ,:; as
econ as we came into the plain, we had occasion enough
to look about us. '1 The" first object we met with was a

dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves
had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work; we
could not say, eating of him, but picking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. -

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast,
neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any
means; for I found we were like to have more business
upon our hands than we were aware of._ We were not
half gone over the plain, but we began to hear the wolves
howl in the woods, on our left, in a frightful manner;
and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in
a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced
officers. I scarce knew in what manner to receive them;
but fiound to draw'ourselves in a close line was the only
way--so we formed in a moment; but that we might not
have too much' interval, I ordered, that only every other
man should fire; and thatthe others, who had not fired,
should stand ready to give them a second volley immedi-

ately, if they continued to advanceupon us; and that .

then those who had fired at first, should not pretend to
load their fusils again, but stand ready, with every one a
pistol, for we were all armed with a fusil and a pair of
pistols each man; so we were, by this method, able to fire
six volleys, half of us at a time; however,-~at present we

" had no necessity, for upon firing the firstavolley, the

enemy made a full stop, being terrified, as well with the
noise as with the fire; four of them being shot in the
head, dropped; several others were wounded, and went
bleeding oif, as we could see by the snow. I found they
stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, re-
membering that I had been told that the fiercest crea-
tures were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all our
company to halloo as loud as we could, and I found the
notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout, they
began to retire and turn about: then I ordered a second
volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the
gallop, and away~they went to the woods. ,
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and

that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had
but little more than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves
into a readiness, "when we heard a terrible noise in the
same wood on our left, only that it was farther onward
the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on, and the night began to be
dusky, which made it the worse On our side , but the

 

noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was the , '

howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on a
sudden, we perceived two or three troops of wolves on
our left, one behind us, and one on our firont, so that we
seemed to be surrounded with them; however, as they

' did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as
we could make our horses go, which, the way being very'
rough, was only agood large trot; and' in this manner
we only came in view of the entrance of the wood through
whichy we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain;
but we were greatly surprised, when, coming near the
lane, or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves stand-
ing just at the entrance-

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard
the noise of a gun , and looking that way, out rushed a
horse, with a saddle and. a bridle on him flyin glike the
wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after ghim full
sp eed: indeed, the horse had the heels of them; but as
we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted not but they would get up with him at last----
and no question buty they did.

Here we had a most hon'ible sight, for, riding up to
the entrance where the horse came out, we found the
carcass of another horse, and of two men, devoured by
these ravenous creatures. One of them was no doubt
the same whom we heard fire a gun, for there lay a gun
just by him fired off; but as to the man, his head, and
the upper part of his body, were eaten up.'

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and
I verily believe there were three hundred of them, It
happened very much to our advantage, that at the en

trance into the wood, but a little way from it, th( re lay
some large timber trees, which had been cut down the
summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I
drew my little troop 1n among these trees, and placing

' ourselves m a line behind one long tree, I advised them
all to alight, and, keeping that tree gbefore us fer a breast-
wdrk, to stand m a triangle, or three fronts, inclosing
our horses' 1n the centre.

We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a
more furious charge than the creatures madeup on usin
this place: they came on us with a growling kind of a
noise, and mounted the piece of timber (which, as I said,
was our breastwork), as if they were only rushing upon
their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was prin-
cipally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us,
which was the prey they aimed at. I ordered our men
to fire as before, every-man; and they took their aim so
sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves at the
first volley , but there was a necessity to keep a continual
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing
on those before. ->>

they stopped a little, and I hop ed they would have gone

again, so we fired our volleys of pistols; and I believe 1n
these four firings we killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many y, yet they came on again.

I Was loath to spend our last shot too hastily y; so I
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better

charged my fusil and his own while we were engaged--
but, as I said, I called my other man, and, giving him a
horn of powder, I bad lnm lay a train all along the piece
of timber, and let it be a large train; he did so, andp had
but time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and
some were got upon it; when I, snapping an uncharged
pistol close to the powder, setit on fire; and those that
Were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or
seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with
the force and fright of the fire: we despatched these in0:0."qu rug>> --,---. '- , ,~-.- ye: - mu v 4w n "v

an instant, and the rest were so frighted with the light,
which the night, for now it was very dark, made more
terrible,-that they drew back a little, --
. Upon which I ordered out last pistols to be fired off in
one volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this,
the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediawa upon
'1 near twenty lame ones, which we found struggling on the
3' ground, and fell a-outting them with our swords, which
: answered our expectation; for the crying and howling

N that they fled and left us. _
' . We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them;
and had it been daylight, we had killed many more. The .
field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again;
, for we had still near a league to go. wWe heard the raven;
ous oreatureshowl and yell. in e woods- as we went
several times, and sometimes we aneied we saw some of
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not cer-
tain ; so in about an hour more, we came to the town
where we- were to lodge, which we found in a terrible
flight, and all in arms; for it seems that the night before,
the wolves and some bears had broken into that village,
and put them in a terrible fright; and they were obliged
to keep guard night and day, but especiallyin the night,
to preserve their cattle, an indeed their people.
, _ The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs
' so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he
' could go no farther; so we were obliged to take a new
guide there and go to Tholouse, where we found a warm
;. . climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no
,1 wolves, or anything like them; but when we told our
i , story at Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what
i .was ordinary'inthe great forest at the foot of the mounv
' tains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but
they inquired much what kind of a guide we had gotten,
that would venture to bring us that way in such a severe

; ' season, and told us, it was very strange we were not all
j ' _ devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves,
" and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly,

and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all de-

strayed--for it was the sight of the horses that made the
wolves so furious, seeing their prey--and that at other
times they are really afraid of a gun: but they being ex-
cessively hungry, and raging on that account, the e ager-
ness to come at the horses had made them senseless of
dan ger, and that if we had not by the continued fire, and
at last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered
them, it had been great odds but that we had Been torn
to pieces ;whereas, had we been content to have sat still
on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have
taken the horses so much for their own when men were
on their back as otherwise; and withal they told us, that
at last, if we had stood altogether and left our horses,

they would have been so eager to have devoured them, -
that we might have come 011' safe, especially having our
fire- arms in our hands, and being so many in number.

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my
life; for seeing above three hundred devils come roaring
and op en-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to
shelter us or, retreat to, I gave myself over for lost, and
as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those moun-
tains again; I think I would much rather go a thousand
leagues by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm
once a-week. I have nothing uncommon to take notice
of in my passage through France, nothing but what
other travellers have given an account of with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Tholouse to
Paris, and without any considerable stay came to Calais,
and landed safe at Dover the 14th of January, after hav-
ing had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, andhad
in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe about
me, the bills of exchange which I brought with me hav-
' ing been very cun'entlyp aid.

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my good
ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had
sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too great,
to em ploy for me; and I trusted her so entirely with
everything, that I was perfectly easy as to the security

of my effects; and indeed I was very happy from my be-n THE 133me rmnrmrou som'a. 293

ginning, and now to" the end, in the'unspotted integrity
of this good gentlewoman. ' "

-, And now I began to think of leaving my efi'ects with
this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the
Brazils. But now another scruple came in the way, and
that was religion; for as I had entertained some doubts
about the Roman religion, even while I was abroad, es-

- 'pecially in my state of solitude, so I knew there was no

going to the Brazils for me, much less going to settle
there, unless I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic
religiongwithout any reserve; except, on the other hand,
I resolved to be a sacrifice/to my principles, be a martyr .
for religion, and die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to

~ stay at home, and, if I could find means for it, to dispose
of my plantation, . ' ' ' '

To' this purpose I wrote to y old friend at Lisbon,

who in return gave me notice, at he could easily dis-
pose of it there; but that if I thought fit to give him leave
to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the survi-
vors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, who must
fully understand the value of it, who lived just upon the

'_ spot, and whom I knew to be very rich, so that he be-
lieved theywould be fond of buying it, he did not doubt
but I should make four or five thousand pieces of sight
the more of it. .
, Accordingly, I agreed, gave him orders to offer it to
them, and he did so; and in about eight months more,
the ship being then returned, he sent me an account,
that, they had accepted the offer, and had remitted thirty-
three thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon to pay for it. In return, I signed the
instrument of sale in the form which they sent from Lis-
bon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills
of exchange for thirty-three thousand pieces of eight for
the estate; reserving the <<payment of one hundred moi-
dores a-yeai' .to him (the old man) during his life, and
fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I
had promised them, and which the plantation was to
make, good as a rent-charge. ' ' " - -

. x . And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune

I
and adventure, a life of Providence' 3 che q,uer-work and
of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show
the like of? beginnm ginning foolishly, but closing much more
happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much
as to hope for.

Any one would think, that in this state of complicated
good fortune, I was past running any more hazards, and
so indeed I had been, if other circumstances had con-
curred: but I was inured to a wandenng 'life, had no
family, nor many relations, nor, however rich, had I con-
tracted much acquaintance; and though I had sold my
estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that country
out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the wing
again; especially I could not resist the strong inclination
I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards
were in being there; and how the rogues I left there had
used them.

My true friend, the widow', earnestly dissuaded me from
it, and so far prevailed with me, that almost for seven
years she prevented my running abroad, during which
time I took my two nephews, the children of one of my

. brothers, into my care; the eldest having something of
his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settle
ment of some addition to his estate, after my decease; the
other I put out to a captain of a ship and after five
years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young
fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea ,
and thisy young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I
was, to further adventures myself. -

In the meantime, I in part settled my self here; for,
first of all, I married, and that not either to my disad-

vantage or dissatisfaction; and had three children, two
:sons and one daughter.

not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than in
the story of my life. Any one would think, that after
thirty-five years of afiliction, and a variety of unhappy
circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through
before, and after near seven years of peace and enjoy-
ment in the fulness of all things--grown old--and when,
if ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience
|of every state of middle life, and to know which was most
---adapted to make .a man completely happy-I say, after
all this, any one would have thought that the native pro~
pensity to rambling, which gave an account of in my
3,,first setting out into the war (1 to have been so predom-
inant in my thoughts, should be .worn out, the, volatile
, part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I
might at sixty-one years of age have been a little inclined
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and for-
tune any more. -

Nay, further, the common motive of * foreign adventures
was taken away in me--for I had no fortune to make, I
had nothing to seek: if Ihad gained ten thousand pounds,
I had been no richer--for I had already sufficient for
me, and for those I had to leave it to, and that I had

. was visibly increasing--for having no great family, I

could not spend the income of what I had, unless I would
set up for an expensive way of living, such as a great
v amily, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which
were things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so
that I had nothing indeed to do, but to sit still, and fully
:11de what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my
an s. . '
- Yet all these thingshad no effect upon me, or at least
not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical dis-
temper; particularly, the desire of seeing my new plan-
tation in the island, and the colony I left there, ran in
my head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and my
imagination ran upon it all day--it was uppermost in
all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short,
nothing could remove it out pf my mind-bit even broke

/ r296' LIFE AND wvnnrunas or ROBINSON 03118013..

so violently into all my discourses, that itmade my con-
versation tiresome; for Ilcould talk of nothing else, all
my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence, and I
saw it myself.

' I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that
all the stir people make in the world about ghosts and
apparitions, is owing to the strength of imagination, and
the powerful operation of fancy in their minds--that
there was no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost
walking, and the like--that people's poring affectionately
upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so re-
alises it to them, that they are .capable of fancying, upon
some extraordinary circumstances, that they see them,
talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth,
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing;
and they really know nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are
any such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking
of people after they are dead, or whether there isany-
thing in the stories they tell us of that kind, more than
the product of vapours, sick minds, and wandering fan:
cies; But this I know, that my imagination worked up
to such a height, and brought me into such excess of
vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually sup-
posed myself oftentimes upon the spot, at my old castle
behind the trees, saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father,
and the reprobate sailors whom I left upon the island--
nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked/at theni'
so steadily, though I was broad awake, as at persons just
before me; and this I did till I often frightened mysel
with the images my fancy represented to me. One time
, in my sleep I had the villany of three pirate sailors so

_ lively related to me, by the first Spaniard and Friday's
father, that it was surprising: they told me how they
barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and
that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up,son
Eurpose to distress and starve them--things that I never

eard of, and that were yet all of them true in fact; but
it was so warm in my imagination, and so realised to me,
that to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded:2: comssuros WITH ms WIFE 297

, but that it was or would be true, also how I resented it
:"when the Spaniard com plainedto, me, and how I brought
- them to justice, tried tlfem before me, and ordered them"
-all three to be hang ed. What there was really' In this,
"' s shall be seen in its place; for however I came to form
' , such things in my dream, and what secret converse oi
- spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, very much of it true.
I own, that this dream had nothing literally and sp ecifi-
cally true; but the general part was so true, the base and
*\ villanous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was 7
\such, and had been so muclnforse than all I can describe,
that the dream had too much similitude of the fact; and
I would afterwards have punished them Severely, so if
' Ihad hang edthem all, Ihad been muehintherig ht, and
{i should have been justifiable, both by the laws of gGod and
man.
3. But to return to my story In this kind of temp er I
had lived some years; Ihad no enjoyment of my life, no
pleasant hours,- no agreeable diversion, but had some
thing or other of this in it; so that my wife, who saw
my mind so wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously -
one night, that she believed there was some secret power-
ful impulse'of Providence upon me, which had deter-
. mined me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going, but my being engaged to a
wife gand children. She told me, that it was true she
could not think of parting with me; but as she was as:
sured, that, if she was dead, it would be the first thing I
would do, so, as it seemed to her that the thing was de- ,
termined above, she would not be the only obstruction ,
for, if I thought fit,' and resolved to go-- Here she
found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked
'very earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her,
and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and
say out what she was going to say? But I perceived
"her heart was too full, and some tears stood' In her eyes.
= " Speak out, my dear," said 1;" are you willing I
' should go?" "No," says she, very affectionately, "I am
far from willing: 'but, if you are resolved to "go," says
she, " and rather than I ywill be the only hindrance, I

/
will go with you; for though I think it a 'preposterous
thing 3for one of your years,' and in your condition, yet
' if it must be," said she again, weeping, "I won't leave
you, for, if it be of Heaven, you must do it, there 1s no
resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your duty to go, he
will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dis-
pose of me, that I may not obstruct 1. "
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me
a little out of the vapours, and I beg an to consider what
- I was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, and be-
gan to argue with myself sedately what business I had,
after threescore years, and aftery such a life of tedious
sufferings and disasters, and closed 1n so happy and easy

a manner--I say, what business had I to rush into new

hazards, and put myself upon adventures, fit only for
youth and poverty to 'run into.

With those thoughts, I considered my new engage-
ment--that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife
then great with child of another--that I had all the
world could give me, and had no need to seek hazards
for gain--that I was declining in years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of seek-
ing to mcrease it--that, as to whatg my wife had said, of
its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should
be my duty toP go, I had no notion of that: so, after

many of these cogitations, I struggled with the power '

of my imagination, reasoned my self out of it, as I believe
people may always do in likey cases, if they will, and,
in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with such
arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my
present condition furnished me plentiquy with, and,
.particularl, as the most efi'ectual method, I resolved to
divert myself with other things, and to engage in some
business that might efi'ectually tie me up from any more
excursions of, this kind; for I found the thing return
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or
anything of moment immediately before me.
To thisp purpose I bought a little farm 1n the county
of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. Ihad
a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it

is,

v. ' ' e

'g\
44. 4:165} LOSES ms wrrn B! DEATH. '299 , .

I found was capable of great improvement, and that it

was many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted
in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of >>

land, and, particularly, being an inland county, I was

removed from conversing among ships, sailors, and

things relating to the remote part of the world.

'gsIn a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family,
bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, horses,
cows, sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became in
one half year a mere country gentleman. My thoughts
'were entirely taken up in managing my servants, culti-

" vating the ground, enclosing, planting, &c. , and I lived,

as I thou g,ht the most agreeable life that nature was

~ capable of3 directing, or that a man always bred to mis

fortunes was capable of being retreated to.

I farmed upon my own land--I had no rent to pay----
_was limited by no articles-J could pull up or cut down
as I pleased--what I planted was for my self, and what

,I' imp roved was for my Pfamily ; and, having left ofi' the

thoughts of wandering, I had not the least discomfort' in
anyp part of my life, as to this world. Now, I thou ght,
indeed, thatI enjoyed the middle state of life, whichb my
father so earnestly recommended to me--a kind of
heavenly life, something like what is described by the
poet upon the subject of a country life:--

Free from vices, free from cars,
Age has no pains, and youth no snare.

But, in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from
unforeseen Providence unhing ed me at once, and not
only made a breach upon me, ginevitable and incurable,
but drove me, by its consequence, upon a deep relapse

i into the wandering disposition, which, as I may say,

being born 1n my very blood, soon recovered its hold of
"me, and, like the returns of a violent distemper, came on
with an irresistible force upon me, so that nothing could
make any more impression upon me. This blow was
the loss of my wife.

It 1s not my business here to write an elegy upon my
wife, to give a character of her particular virtues,an
make my g1court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral

1*
sermon. She was, in a few.words,' the stay of all my

affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, the engine that, by
. her prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I was

in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that

, fluttered in my head as above, and did more to guide

my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a father's in-
structions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning
powers, could do. I was happy in listening to her tears,
and in being moved by her entreaties, and to the last de-
gree, desolate and dislocated inthe world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly
round me; I was as much a stranger in it in my thoughts -
as I was in the Brazils when I went first ~on shOre, and
as much alone, except-as to the assistance of servants,
as I was in my island, I knew neither what to do or
what not to-do; I saw the world busy around me, one
part labouring for bread, and the other part squandering
in vile excesses, or empty pleasures equally miserable,
because the end they pr0posed still fled from them; for
.the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their vice,
and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance, and'
the men of labour spent their strength in daily strug-
glings for bread to maintain the vital strength they la-
boured with; so living in a daily circulation of sorrow----
living but to Work, and working but to live, as if daily
bread were the onlyend of a wearisome life, and a weari-
some life the only occasion of daily bread.' '
' This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom
the island, where I sufl'ered no more com to grow, be-
cause I did not want it, and bred no more goats because
I had no more use for them--where the money'lay inthe
drawer till it grew mildewed, and had scarce the favour
to be looked upOn in twenty years.

All these- things', had I improved them as I ought to
have done, and as reason and religion had dictated to
me, would have taught me to search further than human
enjoyments for afull felicity, and that there was some-
thing which certainly was the reason and end of life,
superior to all these things, and which was eithento; be
possessed, or, at least, hoped for, on this side the grave.'>> 1' anruaus 'ro LONDON.' V ' 801-

But my sage "counsellor was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only nm before the wind:
my thoughts ran all away again into the old affair--my
head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign ad-
ventures; and {all the pleasing innocentpamusements of
my farm and my garden, my cattle and my family, which
before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had
no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or
food to one that has no taste: in a word, I resolved to
leave ofi' housekeeping, let my farm, and return to Lon-
don; and in a few months after I did so.
~SSe4 When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as be--
fore 2. I had no relish to the place, no employment in it,
\ nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person,
of whom it may be said, he is perfectly useless in God's
creation, and it is not one farthing matter to the rest of
his kind whether he be dead or alive. This also was the.
thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the most
my aversion, who had been all my days used to an ac-
tive life; and I would often say to myself, " A state of
idleness is the very dregs of life :" and, indeed, Ithought
I was much more suitably employed when I was twenty-
six days making me a deal board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my
nephew, whom, as I observed before, I had brought up
to the sea, and had made him commander of a ship, was
come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first

"he had made. He came to me, and told me, that some
merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to
him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies and to
China, as private traders: "And now, uncle," says he,
" if you will go to sea with me, I'll en age to land you
upon your old habitation in the islan , for we are to
touch. at the Brazils."

' Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence ofan invisible world, than the
cencurrence of second causes with the ideas of things
which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not
communicated to any'in the world.

wandering was ieturned upon me,,and I knew nothing

of What he had 1n his thoughts to say, when that very
morning, before he came to me, I had, .in a great deal
of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my
circumstances in my mind, came to this resolution,
namely, that I would go to Lisbon and consult with my
old sea- captain; and so, if it was 1ational and practi-
cable, I would go and see the island a gain, and see what
was become ofg my people there. I had pleased myself
also with the thoughts of peopling the place, and carry-

ing inhabitants from hence, getting a patent for the
poSsession, and I know not what; when, m the middle .
of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his "

project of carrying me thither, in his way to :the East
Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and, looking steadily at
him h1m,P"What devil," said I, "sent you thisg unlucky er-
rand ? " My nephew started, as if he had been frighted,
at first; buty perceiving I was not much displeased with
the proposal, he recovered himself. " I hope it may not
be an unlucky proposal, sir," says he; "I dare say you
would be pleased to see your new colony there, where you
once reigned with more felicity than most of your brother
monarchs 1n the world. "

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper,
that 19 to say, with the prepossession I was under, and
of which I have said so much, that I told him m a few
words, if he agreed with the merchants, I would go with
him ; but I told him I would not promise" to go any farther
than my own island. "Why y, sir," says he, "you don't
want to be left there again, I hope?" "Why," said I,
" can you not take me up again in your return ? " He
told me, it could not be possible that the merchants would
allow him to come that way with a loaden ship of such
value, it beinga month's sail out of his way, and might
be three 0r four: "besides, sir, if I should miscarry "
said he, "and not return at all, then you would be just
reduced to the condition you were in before. "

This was very rational: but we both found out a 1emedy
for it. which was, to carry a framed sloop on board the- . .;.;.;;sErs sun" wrrn ms seesaw. 803 .

II ship, which, being takenin'pieces and shipped on board

the ship, might, by. the help of some carpenters, whom
we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island
and finished, 'fit to go to sea in a few days. ,

I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunities

of my nephew joined in so .efiectuallywith my inclina-
' tion, that nothing could oppose me: on the other hand,

my wifebeing dead, I had nobody concerned themselves
so much for me as to persuade me one way or other, ex-
cept my ancient good friend, the widow, who earnestly
struggled with me to consider my years, my easy cir-
cumstances, 'and the needless hazard of along voyage,
and, above all, my young children: but it was all to no

urpose; I had an irresistible desire to. the voyage, and I

, told her, I thought there was somethmg so uncbmmon

in the impressions I hadupon my mind for the voyage,
that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if I should
attempt to stay at home ;- after which she ceased her ex-
postulations, and joined with me, not only in making
provision ,for'my voyage, but also in settling my family
affairs in my absence, and providing for the education of
my~children.

In order to this I made my will, and settled the estate

' I had in such a manner for my children, and placed in

such hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they
would have justice done them, whatever might befall me;
and for their education, I left it wholly to my widow
with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care; all
which she richly deserved, for no mother could have taken
more care in their education, or understood it better;
and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank
her for it"

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of
January 1694-5, and I. with my man Friday, went on
board in the Downs the 8th, having, besides that sleep
which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of
all kinds of necessary things for my colony, which, if I

. "did not find in good condition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I pur-
posed to place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on
work there upon my own account while I staid, and either,

to leave them there, or carry them forward, as, they should
appear willing; particularly, I carried tw'o carpenters,

and a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who _

was a cooper by trade, but was also a general mechanic;
for he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills
to grind corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker ;
he also made anything that was proper to make of earth

or of wood: in a word, we called him our "Jack of all_

trades."

With these I carried a tailor, who had ofiered himself
to go passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but
afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation, and
proved a most necessary handy fellow as. could be desired,
in many other businesses besides that of his trade, for,
as I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all employ~
ments.

My ycargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not
kept an account of the particulars, consisted of a sufli-

cient quantity of linen, and some thin English stufi's for

clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there, and
, enough of them as, by my calculation, might comfortably
supply them for seven years. If I remember right, the
materials which I carried for clothing them, with gloves,
hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds,
including some beds, bedding, and household stufl, par.
ticularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter,
'brass, &c., besides, near a hundred pounds more in iron-
work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges,
and every necessary thing I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces
of brass cannon; and because I knew not what time and
what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred

barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the Hon _

part of some pikes and halberts; so that, in short, we had
a large magazine of all sorts of stores; and I made my
nephew carry two small quarter- -deck guns more than he

wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there was occa-
'sion; that when they came there we might build a fort
and man it against all sorts of enemies: and indeedI at
first thought there would he need enough of it all, and
much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the
island, as shall be seen in the course of the story. . , - '

some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad weather, hap-'
pened on this first setting out, which made the voyage
longer than I expected at first; and I, who had never
made but one voyage, namely, my first voyage to Guinea,1
in which I might be said to come back again as the voy-r'
age was first designed, began to think the same ill fate
still attended me; that I was born never to be contented
with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate
at sea. 3': r '"' ' "
_ Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we
were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we
lay wind-bound two- and-thirty days: but we had this
satisfaction with the disaster, thaty provisions were here
exceedingly. cheap, and in the utmost pylent y; so that-
while we lay here we never touched the ship' s stores, but
rather added to them. Here I also took several ho gs,
and two cows with their calves, which I' resolved, if I had
a good passage, to put on shore 1n my island, but we found 7
occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
. :- We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very fair gale of wind for some days; as I rememq
her, it might beg about the 20th of February, in the even-
ing late, when the mate having the watch, came into the" --
round- house, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard '
agun fired; and while he was telling us of it, a boy came '
in, and told us the boatswain heard another. This made
us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for a while
we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we saw a very
great light, and found that there was some very terrible
fire at a distance. Immediately we had recourse to our

. U"wreckoningsdn'which w'e'au agreed that there could be no
land that way in which the fire showed itself--no, not
for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at west-northa

west?" Upon this, we concluded it must be some ship on '

fire at sea; and, as by our hearing the noise of guns just

before we concluded that it could not be far off, we stood '

    

,directly towards it, and were presently satisfied we should '

discover it, because the farther we sailed the greater the
light appeared, though the weather being hazy, we could
not perceive anything but the light for a while." In about
half an hour's sailing; the wind being fair for us, though
'not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we

' V"

could plainly discern it was a great ship on fire in the c -

middle of the sea. . . .
I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though
not at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I
presently recollected my former circumstances, in what
condition I was in when taken up by the Portugal cap-

, tain; and how much more deplorable the circumstances

of the poor creatures belonging to this ship must be if .

they had no other ship in company with them: upon this,

I immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one ' -

s soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to
, them that there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for
" though we could see the flame in the ship, yet they, it
' being night, could see nothing of us.>> It; a -3:
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the
'burning ship drove, waiting for daylight; when on a sud-
den, to our great terror, though we had reason to expect

' it, the ship blew up in the air, and immediatel sunk.
This was terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, or the ' m
sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must be either '

all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in ' :1
their boats in the middle of the ocean, which, at present, r. 7

them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out

them know by this, that there was a ship not far 011'. '

About eight 0 cl'ock 1n the morning we discovered the

_ ship's boat? by the help of our perspective glasses; and
found there were two of Pthem, both throng ed with people,
and deep in the water: we perceived they rowed, the wind
being against them--"that they saw our ship, and did the
utmost to make us see them.' ,

3 ' -* We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know
we saw them, and yhung a waft out, as a signal for them
to come on board; angd then made more sail, standing

directly to themt-WIn a little more than half an hour we

5'? came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in,

7-: being no less than sixty-four men, women, and children ,

i for there were a great many passengers. ,. r-

" I Up on the whole, we found it was a French merchant

, ship of three hundred tons, homeward boundfrom Quebec, ,_
- in the river of Canada. The master gave us a long 9.0.: >>

count of the distress of his ship, how the fire beg an in

the steerage by the negligence of the steersman; but, onf '7 . '

his crym rymg out for help, was, as everybody thong ht, ens>>--
tirelyg at out: but they soon found that some sparks of
the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship, so
difficult to come at, that they could not effectually quench
it; and afterwards getting in behind the timbers, and
within the ceiling ofg the ship, it proceeded into the hold,

and mastered all the skill and all the application they I

' were able to exert.

~ They had no more to do then but to get into their boats,

' 1 which, yto their great comfort, were pretty large; being
their long -boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skifl,

' which was of no great service to them, other than to get

_ ' - ; some fresh water and provisions into her, after they had
j J. secured themselves from the fire. They had indeed small
;~ hop e of their lives by getting into these boats at that die:
5* p tance from any land; only, as they said well, that they
' ~ were escaped from the fire, and had a possibility that
' some ship might happen to be at sea, and might take them'
in. They had sails, cars, and a compass; and were pre-
paring to make the best of their way to Newfoundland
the wind blowing pretty fair; for it blew an easy gale at
south- east- by-e ast. They had as much provisions and

 

 

(
water, as, with Sparing it so as to be next door to starv
ing, might support them about twelve days; in which,
if they had no bad weather, and no contrary winds, the
captain said, he h0p ed he might get to the banks of

Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish to SUS'_

tain them till they might go on shore. But there were
so many chances against them 1n allthese cases--such as,
storms to overset and founder them, rains and cold to
benumb and perish their limbs, contrary winds to keep
them out and starve them--that it must have been next
to miraculous if they had escaped.

In the midst of their consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain, with team
.in 1his e yes, told me, they were on a sudden surprised
with they joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four
more; these were the five guns which I caused to be fired
at first seeing the light: this revived their hearts, and
gave them the notice which, as above, I design ed it
shpuld, namely, that there was a ship at hand for their
he
' It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took'

down their masts and sailsg; and the sound coming from'

' windWard, they resolved to lie by till morning. 8Some
time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired three
muskets, one a considerable while after another; but
these, the wind being contrary, we never heard.

Some time after that again, they were still more agreev
ably surprised with seeing our liy ghts, and hearing our
guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be fired all the
' rest of the night: this set them to work with their oars
to keep their boats ahead, at least that we might the
,sooner come up with them; and at last, to their mex-
pressible Joy, they- found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, .353},

 

 
 

the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these
poor delivered people ran into, to express the Joy of their

souls at so unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear,

variety; but an excess of joy, a surpiise of joy, has a '__- REFLECTIONS.

thousand extravagances 1n iti there were some in tears,
some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been
in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving
and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamp-
ing with their feet, others wringing their hands; some
were dancing, several singing, some laughing, more cry-
, ing; many quite dumb, not able to speaka word; others
sick and vomiting, several swooning, and ready to faint ,
; ' and a few were crossing themselves and giving God
" thanks. '

; :1. I would not wrong them neither--there might be many
that were thankful afterward; but the passion was too
strong for them at first, and they were not able to mas-
ter it--they were thrown into ecstasies and a kind of
' ,'frenzy; and so there Were but a very few who were com-
- posed and serious in their Joyi.

;pPerha s also the case may have some addition to it,
from theP particular circumstance of the nation they be-
longed to--I mean the French, whose temper is allowed
to bge more volatile, more passionate, and more, sprightly,
and their spirits more fluid, than of other nations. I
am not a philosopher to determine the cause, but nothing
I had ever seen before came up to it; the ecstasies poor
Friday y, my trusty savage, was in, when he found his
father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the sur-
prise of the master, and his two companions, whom I
delivered from the villains that set them on shore on the
island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was to
compare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or any-
where else in my life.

.3", It' is further observable, that these extravagances did
not show themselves in that different manner I have
mentioned, in different persons only; but all the variety
would appear in a short succession of moments," in one
and the same person. A man that we saw this minute
dumb, and, as it were, stupid and confounded, should
the next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic;
and the next moment a-tearing his hair,g or pulling his
. clothes to pieces, and stamping gthem under his feet like
" a madman. a few minutes after that we should have

V. annals. ,
him fall into am, then sick, then swooning; and, had
not immediate help been had, would in a few moments
more have been dead: and thus it was, not with one or
two, or ten, or twenty, but with the greatest part of
them , and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged
to let above thirty of them blood.

There were two priests among them, one an old man,
and the other' a young man; and that which was strangest
was, that the oldest man was the worst.

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship ,and saw .
himself safe, he dropped down stone dead to all appear-
ance--not the least sign of life could be perceived in
him. Our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies
to recover him, and was the only man in the ship that
believed he was not dead; and at length he opened a
vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part, '
so as to warm it as much as possible: upon thisP the
blood, which only dropped at first, flowed something
freely; in three minutes after the man opened his eyes,
and, yabout a quarter of an hour afta that, he spoke,

grew better, and, in a little time, quite well. After the
blood was stopped, he walked about, told us that he was
perfectly well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon

gave him, and was, what we called, come to himself.
About a quarter of an hour after this they came running
into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French
woman that had fainted, and told him the priest was
gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the
change of his circumstances in his mind, and this put
him into an ecstasy of joy , his spirits whirled about

faster than the vessels could convey them; the blood A

grew hot and feverish, and the man was as fit for bedlam
as any creature that ever was in it: the surgeon would
not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him
somethingto dozeg and put him to sleep ,which, after some _
time, operated upon him, and he waked next morning .,
perfectly composed and well.

The younger priest behaved himself with great coma-

mand of his passion, and was really an example of 11 ~ "

serious, well governed mind. At his first coming on .board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, pros-

trating himself 1n thankfulness for his deliverance; in
which I unhapp fly and unseasonably disturbed him,
really thinking he had been in a swoon; but he spoke
calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving chd thanks >

for his deliverance, begged me to leave him a few mo-
* ments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me
thanks also.

, I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not enly

I V .' left him, but kept others from interrup ting him also: he
r, . ' continuedin that posture about three minutes, or a little
'3'} more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had said

he would, and with a great deal of seriousness and. afi'ec-
tion, but with tears in grhis eyes, thanked me that had,

under God, given him and so many miserable creatures

their lives. I told him I had no room to move him to
thank God for it rather than me , for I had seen that he
had done that already: but I added, that it was nothing

but what reason and humanity dictated to all men, and
that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God,

.who had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments .

of his mercy to many of his creatures.
After this, the young priest applied himself to his

'country folks-<<laboured to compose them--persuaded,
1entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his ut-
' most to keep them within the exercise of their reason;

and with some he had success, though others were, for a
time, out of all government of themselves.

I cannot helpg committing this to writing, and perhaps .
it maybe useful to those into whose hands it may fall, in
the guiding themselves' in all the extravagances yof their
passions, for, if an excess of joy can carry men out to
such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what will
not the extravagances of anger, rage, and a provoked
mind, carry us to 9 And, indeed, here I saw reason for
keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of eVery
kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of
sorrow and anger.

We were sometimes disordered by these extravagances
among our new guests for the firsty day; but when they
had been retired, lodgings provided for them all as well
as our ship would allow, and they had slept heartily, as
' most of them did, being fatigued and frightened, they
were quite another sort of people the next day.
_ Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments
for the kindness shown them, was wanting; the French,
it is known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that way.
The captain and one of the priests came tome the next
day, and, desiring to speak with me and my nephew, the
commander began toconsult with' us what should be
done with them: and,.first, they told us,' that as we had
saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a
return to us for the kindness received. The captain
said, they had saved some money, and some things of
value in their boats, catched hastily out of the flames;
and if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an
offer of it all to us ; they only desired to be set on shore
somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might get
a passage to France. '
, My nephew was for accepting their money at first word,
and to consider what to do with them afterwards; but 1
overruled him in that part; for I knew what it was to be
set on shore in a strange country; and if the Portugal
captain that took me up at sea had served. me so, and
took all that I had for my deliverance, I must have
starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as
I had been at Barbary, the being sold _to a Mahometan
only excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much
worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken
them upin their distress, it was true; but that it was
our duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we
would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like or
any other extremity; that we had done nothing for them
but what we believed they would have done for us, if we

'had been in their case, and they in ours; but that we
took them up to serve them, not to plunder them; and
that it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little
from them which they had saved out of the fire, and then

set them on shore and leave them} that this would be
first to save them from death, and then kill them our-
selves--save them from drowning, and then abandon
them to starving: and therefore I would not let the least
.1 thing be taken from them. As to setting them on shore,
' I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difliculty to
y ' us, for that the ship was bound to the East Indies; and
f}; though we were driven out of our course to the' westward.
51: ' a very great way, which perhaps was directed by Heaven
if --on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for
if us wilfully to change our voyage on this particular ao-
E count; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to
'3' the freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to
pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil; and all I knew
he could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of -
meeting with other ships homeward bound from the West
Indies, and get them passage, if possible, to England or
France. . . '
- The first part of the proposalwas so generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it; but they were
in a great consternation, especially the passengers, at the
notion of being carried away to the East Indies: they
then entreated me, that seeing that Iwas driven so far
' to the westward before I met with them, I would at least
keep on the same course to the banks of Newfoundland,
' where it was possible I might meet with some ship or
sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada,
(min whence'they came. _ ,
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I
considered, that to carry this whole company to the East
:' Indies would not only be an intolerable severity to the
j poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage by
.'_,'.~ 3 ' devouring all our provisions; so I thought it no breach
;- . of charter-party, but what an unforeseen accident made
i absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one could
say We were to blame; for the laws of God and nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two
boats full of people in such a distressed condition; and

the nature of the thing, as well respecting ourselves as

we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and
weather would permit; and, if not, that I would carry ' SS -
them to Martinico, in the West Indies. ' 33'}?

several opportunities of sending them to France; for we

long beating up against the wind, that they durst take ' -
in no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for the

voyage, as Well for themselves as for those they should

take in; 'so we were obliged to go on. It was about a

people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to

CHAPTER XXII.

Exxon hence we directed our course for the West Indies, 5;:
steering away south and south-by-east, for about twenty ' "'-
days together, sometimes little or no wind at all, when
We met with another'subject for our humanity to work
upon, almost as deplorable as that before. 1 -'

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees fiveminutes north, and the 19th day of March 1694- 5, when
:we espied a sail, our course south- east-and-by -south<< We
soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up_
to us , but could not at first know what to make of her,
till, after coming a little nearer; we found she had lost
her main-topmast, foremast, and bowsprit, and presently
_ Ashe fires a gun as a signal of distress". The weather was
pretty good, wind at north-north-west, a fresh gale, and
' ' we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from Bar
: badoes but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes,
"L a few days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible
' . ,_ hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both
gone on shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm,
'. they were but in an indifierent case for good artists to
bring the ship home. They had been already nine weeks
at sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the
hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of
their knowledge to the Westward and' m which they had
lost their masts, as above; they told us they expected to
have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven
away again to the south-east by a strong gale of wind at " _
1- north-north-west, the same that blew now, and having
no sails to work the ship with, but a main- course, and a
kind of square sail upon a jury-foremast, which they had
set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were en-
deavouringy to stand away for the Canaries.
. J' But that which was worst of all, was, that they Were
,almost starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues
they had undergone; their bread and flesh was quite
gone, they had not an an ounce left' in the ship, and had
had none for eleven days, the only relief they had was,
their water was not all sp,ent and they had yabout half
a barrel of flour left, they had sugar enough, some suc-
eades, or sweatmeats, they had at first, but they were
devoured; and they had seven casks of rum. -\
er There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant
on board, who were going passengers, and, thinking the
ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the even-
ing before the hurricane began; and, having no provi-

'sions of their own .left, they were in a more deplorable
condition than the rest; for the seamen, being reduced
to such an extreme necessity themselves, 'had no com- '
passion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and
they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very '
hard to describe.

Ihad perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had ' :3
not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind abated,
to go on board the ship: the second mate, who uponthis
occasion commanded the ship, had been on board our
ship ;- and he told me indeed, that they had three pas-
sengers in the great cabin, and that they were in a de-
plorable condition. "Nay," says he, "I believe they are
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two
days; and I was afraid to inquire after them," said he,
"for I had nothing to relieve them wit ."

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what
relief we could spare; and, indeed, I had so far overruled, '
things with my nephew, that I would have victualled
them, though we had gone away to Virginia, or any part
of the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves: but '
there was no necessity for that. .

But now they were in a new danger, for they were
'afi'aid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them. The mate, or commander, brought six men with
him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked like
skeletons, and were so weak they could hardly sit to
their oars ; the mate himselfwas very ill, and half-starved, '
for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men,; .
and went share and share alike with them in every bit
they ate.

; I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before
him immediately, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls
before he began to be sick and out of order ;_ so he stopped
'awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth, which he said would be to him both food and
physic, and after he had taken it he grew better. In the ' ~
meantime, I forgot not the men--I ordered victuals to
be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured
than ate it; they were so exceedingly hungry that they

which'he had given the mate that was on board, and
which he did not question would restore them gradually.
" I was not'satisfied with this, but, as I said above,
-having a great mind to see the scene of misery ,which I
knew the ship itself would present me withry m a more

lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the,

captain of the ship, as we now calledy him, with me, and
went myself a little after 1n their boat.
I found the poor men on board almost' m a tumult to

get the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready, but

_my mate observed his order, and kept a good guird at
the cook-room door--and the men he placed there, after
using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them
off by force; however, he caused some biscuit cakes to be

4 dip ped' 1n the pot, and softened them with the liquor of

thep meat, which they call brewis, and gave every one one,
to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their
own safety that he was obliged to give them. but little at
a time. But it was all in vain; and had not I come on
board, and their own commander and ofiicers with me,

and with good words, and some threats also ofg1 giving

them no more, I believe they would have broke into the
cook-room by force, and tom the meat out of the furnace

--for words indeed are of a very small force to an hungry
bell y--however, we pacified them, and fed them gradually

and ycautiously for the first time, and the next time gave '

them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men
did well enough.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was

, of another nature, and far bey ond the rest; for as, first,

the ship's company had so little for themselves, it was
but too true that they had at first kept them very low,
and at last totally neglected them , so that for six or seven
days, it might be said, they had really had no food at all,
and for several days before very little. ~

The poor mother, who, as the first mate reported, was
a womari of good sense and good breeding, had spared
all she could get so afi'ectionately for her son, that at last
she entirely sank under it, and when the mate of our
ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her

i' back up against the sides, between two chairs which were
lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her shoulders,
like a corpse, though not quite deadxe My mate said all
he could to revive and encourage her, and, with a spoon,
put some broth into her mouth; she opened her lips,
and lifted up one hand, but could not speak; yet she un-
derstood what he said, and made signs to him, intimat-
ing, that it was too late for her ;. but pointed to her child,
as if she would have said, they 'should take care of himr
:1 However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved with
.; the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her
mouth; and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down,
'- though I question whether he could be sure of it or not:
but it was qtoo late, and she died the same night.

".~ The youth,- who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother' s life, was not so far gone: yet he lay
'f in a cabin bed as one stretched out, with hardly any life .
. left in him: he had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, .,
'1 having eaten up the rest of it: however, beingyoung, and
having more strength thanhismother, the mate got some-5

' thing down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive,
though, by giving him some time after but two or three

' spoonfuls extracrdinary, he was very sick, and brought
it up again. 1

' 'i: But the next care was the poor maid. she lay all along
upon the deck hard by her mistress, and just like one that
had fallen down with apoplexy, and struggled for life:
her limbs were distorted, one of her hands was clasped>>
round the flame of one chair, and she gripped it so hard
that we could not easily make her let it g;o her other
arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together,
set fast against the frame of the cabin table: in g,short
she lay just like one in the last agonies of death, and yet . =
she was alive too.:. ,

1'9, The poor creature was not only starved with hunger,
and temfied with the thoughts of death, but, as the men
told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress,
whom she saw dying two or three days before, and whom
1f she loved most tenderly.

. We knew not what to do with this poor girl, for whenour surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and
'- experience, and great application, recovered, her as to life,-
2 . he had her upon his hand as to her senses; for she was
little less than distracted for a considerable time after, as
shall appear presently. ' , . _ 7 4,;
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a jour-. .
ney into the country, where sometimes people stay a week "
or a fortnight at a place. Our business was to relieve this :
distressed ship's crew, but" not to lie by for them; and 'y
though they were willing to steer the same course with us '
for some days, yet we could carry no sail to_ keep pace
with a ship that had no masts: however, as their captain
' begged of us to help him to set up a main-topmast, and
a kind of topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were,"
he by him for three or four days, and then, having given _
him five barrels of beef and pork, two hogsheads of biscuit,
and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things
we could spare, and taking three casks of sugar, and some
rum, and some pieces of eight, of them for satisfaction,
we left them, taking on board with us, at their own ear-
nest request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods; ,'
:2;The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a
pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth; greatly do; .
' jected with the loss of his mother, and, as it seems, had
lost his father but a few months before at Barbadoes. He- , '
begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of .
the ship,.for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his ., ,;
. mother ;- and, indeed, so they had, that is to say, passively :-, . -
for they might have spared a small sustenance to the poor
" helpless widow,that might have preserved her life, though,>>
it had been just to keep her alive. But hunger knows no
' v- , friend, no relation, no justice, no right, and therefore is
' remorseless, and capable of no compassion. '
' The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how
it would carry him away from all his friends, and put
him, perhaps, in as bad circumstances almost as we found",
them in--that is to say, starving in the world. ->> He said '
he mattered not whither he went, if he was but delivered '
from the terrible crew that he wasamong--that the captain Zsums AT ms om) mmurrox. 321

(by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my
ne pheVv) had saved his life, and he was sure would not
_hurt him, and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came
1 to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry
them whither we would The surgeon represented the
case so affectionately to me, that I yi,e1ded and took them
(both on board, with all their goods, except eleven hogs-
' heads of sugar, which could not be removed or come at;

his commander sign a writing, obliging him to go, as soon
as he came to Bristol, to one Mr Rogers, a merchant there,
} to whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver a
' letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had
belongin gmg to the deceased widow: which, Ig suppose, was
not done; for I could never learn that the ship came to
Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being

It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of this
poor fellow's joy, when he came to his father--how he em-
braced him, 'kissed him, stroked his face, took him up in
his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down by him

--then stood and looked at him, as any one would look at -
a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together--then .

lay down upon the ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed
them, and then got up again, and stared at him; one would
have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would have
made a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion
ran out another way: in the morning he walked along
the shore, to and again, with his father, several hours,
always leading him by the hand as if he had been a lady;
and every now and then would come to fetch something
or other for him from the boat, either a lump of sugar,
or a dram, a biscuit, or something or other that was
good. In the afternoon, his fi'olics ran another way; for
then he would set the old man down upon the ground,
and dance about him, and make a thousand antic p084
tures and gestures; and all the while ' he did this he
would be talking to him, and telling him one story or an-
other of his travels, and of what had happened to him
abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial afi'ec-
tion was to be found in Christians to their parents in
our parts of the world, one would be tempted to say
there hardly would have been any need of the fifth com:
mandment. ' _ '1

But this is a digression; I return to'my' landing. .It
would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and
civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The first
Spaniard, whOm, asI said, I knewvery well, was he whose
life I saved--he came towards the boat, attended by one

more, carrying 'a flag of truce also--and he did not only .

not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion,
of its being 'me that was come, till I spoke to him.
" Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, " do you not know
me ?" At which he spoke not a word; but giving his muse
ket to the man that was with him, threw his arms abroad,

and, saying something in Spanish that I did not perfectly

' hear, came forward and embraced me, telling me he was
inexcusable not to know that face again that he had once
seen; as of an angel from Heavenwent to save his life:
he said abundance of very handsome things, as awell-bred
Spaniard always knows how--rand then, beckoning to the
person that attended him, bade him go and call out his
comrades, He then asked me if I would walk to my old
habitation, where he would give me possession of my
own house again, and where I should see there had been
but mean improvements. 'So I walked along with him;
but, alas! Icould no more find the place again than if I
had never been there :, for they had planted so many

' trees, and placed them in such a posture, so thick and

. close to one another, in ten years'time they were grown

f so big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, except
by such windings and blind ways as they themselves only
who made them could find. ' -

H. ._ I asked them, what put them upon all these fortifica-

tions '2' He told me, I would saythere was need enough
of ,it, when they had given an account how they had
passed their time since their arriving in the island, espe-
cially after they had the misfortune to find'that I was
gone : he told me he could not but' have some satisfac-
,. tion in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone

i ' in a good ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had

 

 

oftentimes a strong persuasion, that one time or other
he should see me again: but nothing that ever befell him
in his life, he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him
at first, as the disappointment he was under when he
came back to the island, and found I was not there.

,. Asto the three barbarians (so he called them) that
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long
story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their number
was so small. f'And," says he, "had they been strong
enough, we had been long ago in purgatory ;" and with
that he crossed himself upon the breast. " But, sir,"
says he, " I hope you will not be displeased when I shall
tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for
our own preservation, to disarm them, and make them326 1.1111 11w ADVENTURES or nosmson sateen.

our subjects, who would not be content with being mu-
deratelyJ our masters,- but would be our murderers. " I
answered, "I was heartily afraid of it when I left them
there; and nothing troubled me at my parting from the
island, but that they were not toine back, that I might
have put them in possession of everything first, and left
the other in a state of snb jec'tion, as they deservedi but
if they had reduced them to it, I Was yer'yg glad, and
should be very far from finding any fault with iii-PS01" I
knew they were a parcel of refractory,- fingoveriiable,
villains,- and Were fit for any manner of mischie. "
While' I was saying this, came the man whom he had
sent back, and withhim eleVen men more. In the dress
they Were in, it was impossible to guess What nation they
were of; but he made all clear, both to them and tome.
First he turned to me, and, pointing to them, said,
" These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their
lives to you, a" and then turning to them, and pointing

to me', he let them' know who I Was; upon Which they

all came up one by one, not as if they had been sailom,
and ordinary fellows, ide the like, but really as if they
had been ambassadoi's' oi" noblemen, and I a monarch or
a great conqueror; their behaviour was to the last de-

Spaniards' great grief and disappointment, you may be

The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when the
Spaniards came on shore, they gave my letter to them,
and gave them provisions and other relief, as I had or-
dered them to do; also they gave them the long paper of
directions, which I had left with them, containing the
particular methods which I took for managing every part
of my life there--the way how I baked my-bread, bred
up my tame goats, and planted my com--how I curedI

if they were ground-landlords, he hoped if they built
tenements upon the land, and made improvements, they
would, according to the custom of all landlords, grant
them a long lease; and bade them go fetch a scrivener
to draw writings. One of the three, cursing and raging,
told them they should see they were not in jest; and
going to a little place at a distance, where the honest men
had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a fire-
brand and claps it to the outside of their hut, and very
fairly set it on fire; and it would have been all burnt
down' m a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the fellow, thurst him away, and trod the fire out with
his feet, and that not without some difficulty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's

thrusting him away, that he turned up on him with a

pole he had 1n his hand; and had not the man avoided
the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended
his days at once. His comrade, seeing the dang er they
were both 1n, ran in after him, and immediately they
came both out with their muskets; and the man that

was first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down '

who beg an the quarrel, withp the stock of his musket, and
that before the other two could come to help him; and
then, seeing the rest come at them, they stood together,
and, presenting the other ends of theiry pieces to them,
bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too; but one of the
two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made des-
perate by his danger, told themif they offered to move hand
or foot they were all dead men, and boldly commanded
them to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, lay
down theiry arms; but seeing him resolute, it brought them
to a parley, and they. consented to take their 'wounded
man with them and beg one, and, indeed it seems the
fellow was wounded suffigciently with the blow: however,
they were much in the wrong, since they had the advan-
tage, that they did not disarm them efi'ectually, as they
might have done, and might have gone immediately to
the Spaniards, and given them an account how the
rogues had treated them, for the three villains studied'__C/;..,-.nr -_ _---...,.V-,'.qcl

they had a fair opportunity; In order to this, they re-
,solved to go to the castle, as they called it, that was my

Ir happened that,"the day before, twoof the Spaniards

the Spaniards came home at night, and they were all at

supper, he took the freedom to reprove the three Eng- -

lishmen, though in gentle and mannerly terms, and asked-

them how they could be so 'cruel, they being harmless,

inofi'ensive fellows, and that they were putting themselves

in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it had cost

then; a great deal to bring things to such perfection as
they had.

One of the Englishmen returned Very briskly, "What
had thpy to- do thgere ? 1" That they came on shore without
leave, and thet they should not plant or build up on the
island; it was none yof their ground." "W11 y," says the
Spaniard, very calmly, " Seignior Inglese, they must not
starve." The EnglisMan replied, like a true roug h-
hewn t arpaulin, " The might starve, if they choose; they
should" not plant nor uild 1.11 that p.1aee " "But what
must they do, then, Seignior? " says Pthe Spaniard. An-
other of the brutes returned, "Do! why, they should he
servants, and work for them.' "But how can you ex-
pect that of them ? they are not bought with your money ,
you have no rig ht to make them servants." The Eng-
glishman answered, !' The island was theirs, the governor
had given it to them, and no man had anything to do
there but themselves ;" and with that swore that he would
go and burn all their new huts--they should build none
upon their land. '

"Why, Seignior," says the Spaniard, "by the same

ends, we must be your servants too." "A y," says the
bold dog, "and _so you shall, too, before we have done
with you ,_' 'rnixing two or three oaths' 1n the proper in-
tervals of his speech, The Spaniard only smiled at that,
and made him no answer. However, this little discourse
had heated them; and, starting up, one says to the other
-I think it was he they called: Will. Athnh'fcome,
Jack, let us go and have the other brush with them 3 we
will demolish their castle, I will warrant you; they shall
Elam no colony' in our dominions '?

Upon this, they were all trooping away, with every
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some
inso lent things among themselves, of what they would do
to the Spaniards, too, when opportunity offered; but the
Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them

been, though they were but two to three--so that, had .

they met, there certainly would have been bloodshed
among them; for they were all very stout, resolute fel-
lows, to give them their due.

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder,
than they themselves could do to meet--for, as they had
dogged one another, when the three were gone thither,
the two were here--and afterwards, when the two went
back to find them, the three were come to the old habi-
tation again: we shall see their differing conduct pre-
sently. When the three came back like furious creatures,
flushed with 'the rage which the work they had been
about put them into, they. came up to theSpaniards, and
told them what they had done, by way of scofi and bra-
vado; and one of them stepping up to one of the Sp an-
iards, as if they had been a couple of. boys at play, takes
hold of his hat, as it was upon his head, and,gi giving it

, a twirl about, jeering in his face, says he to him," And ,

you, Seignio Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce,
if you do not mend your manners." The Spaniard, who,
though quite a civil man, was as brave as a man could
desire to be, and withal a strong well-made man, looked
steadily at him a good while, and then, having no wea-
pon in his hand, gstepped gravely up to him, gand with
one blow of his fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled

the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately:

' made all the Sp aniards their enemies, as well as their
, own countrymen, they beg an to cool, and, giving the
Spaniards better words, would have had theirarmsagain;
- but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was between

them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would

' be the. best method "they could take to keep them from

and if they would live peaceably, they would be very
willing to assist and associate with them, as they did
before, but that they could not think ofg1 giving them their
arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do mis-
chief with them to their own countrymen, and had even
threatened them all to make them their servants."
The rogues were not more capable to hear reason than
to act reason ;' but being refused their arms, they went

<<- ' raving away, and raging like madmen, threateningwhat
. they would do,- though they had no fire-arms; but the

Spaniards, 'despising their threatening, told them they

them as they would do ravenous beasts, whenever they

' _ found them; and if they 'fell into their hands alive, they

two men in passion and rage enough also, though of an-

' u could scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards
; were so eager to tell them ,theirs; and it was strange

- ings; but the two Englishmen resolved to have their

that they were already disarmed: they could not consent
that they.(the two) should pursue them with fire- -arms,
and perhaps kill them." But, " said the grave Spaniard,

"Who was their governor, "We will endeavour .to make

them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for, as
there is no doubt but they will come to us again when
their lpassion is over, being not able to subsist Without
our assistance, we promise you to make Ino peaee with
them, W1thout havingafull satisfaction for you; and upon
this condition we hope you will promise to use no .svio.
lence with them, other than' in your defence."

lJ.'he two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly,
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested
they did it only to keep them from _Pbloodshed, and to
make all easy at last; for, said they ,we are not so many
of Ins--here is room enough for us yall, and it' 1s a great
pity We should not be all good friends. At length the
did consent, and waited for the 1ssue of the thing ,living

' - private resentments, and look to the preservation ,of their
lives.- w 1w: L1..111
:6 It happened one night that the Spaniard governor, as
I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had
saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or governor
of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the mght, and
could by no means get any sleep: he was perfectly well
in body, as he told me they story, only found his thoughts
tumultuous; and his mind ran upon men fighting, ind
killing one another, but was broad awake, and could not
by any means get any sleep: in short, he lay a great
while, but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved
to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, upon goat
skins, laid thick up on such couches and pads as they

made for themselves, and not in hammocks, and ship):
beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon their
feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their
pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their
thoughts guided them.

Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being dark,
he could see little or nothing; and besides, the trees
which I had p,lanted as in my former account is de-
scribed, and which were now grown tall, intercepted his
si g,ht so that he could only look up, and see that it was a
clear starlight night; and, hearing no noise, he returned
and laid him down again. But it was all one, he could
not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything like
rest, but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and
yet he knew not fgor what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking about,
going out and coming in, another of them waked, and,
calling g, asked who it was that was up? The governor
told him how it had been with him." Say you so. '" says
the other Spaniard, " such things are not to be slighted,
I assure you--there is certainly some mischief working g', ,
says he, "near 1'13 ;" and presently he asked him, "Where _
are the Englishmen '2" "They are all in their huts," '
says he, " safe enough. " It seems the Spaniards had
kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a
place, where the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny,
always quartered by themselves, and could not come at
the rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, "there is some 'q we rmrms or savaens LAND on THE ISLAND. 841 '

thing in it, I am persuaded from my own experience; I
am certain our spirits embodied have converse with, and
receive intelligence from, -the spirits unembodied, and
inhabiting the invisible world ; and this friendly notice
_ is given for our advantage, if we know how to make use
of it.'~ Come,'? says he; 'f let us go out and look abroad;-
7 and if we find nothing at all in it to justify our trouble,
I'll tell you a story to the purpose, that shall convince
you of the justice of my proposing it." . 7
1?; Ina word, they went out to go to the top of the hill,
:_ where I used to go ;- but they, being strong, and in good
"' company, nor alone, as I was, used none of my cautions
to go up by the ladder, and then pulling it up after them,
' to go up a second stage to the top,- but were going round
through the grove unconcerned and unwary, when they
. were surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very little
" way 011' from them, "and hearing the voices of men, not
of one or two, but of a great number. >>_ '
" in In all the discoveries I had made of the savages land-
ing on the_island,jit'jwas my constant care to prevent
, them making the least discovery of there being any in-
} ,habitants upon the place; and when, by any necessity,
I 1. they came to know it, they felt it so eflectually, that they
. ' that got away were scarce able to give any account of it,
for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did ever any
that had seen fire, escape to tell any one else, except it
.~ . were the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped
into the boat, of whomI mentioned that I was afraid they
should go home and bring more help. , -

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of those
men,' that so great a number came now together; or
i ' whether they came ignorantly, and by accident, on their
"5 usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it seems,
understand :3 but whatever it was, it had been their busi-
" ness, either to have concealed themselves, and not have
seen them at all, much less to have let the savages have
" seen that there were any inhabitants in the place; but
7 to have fallen upon them so efi'ectually, asthat not a man
_ of them should have escaped, which could only have been
by getting in between them and their boats: but this pre'Mr-

for fear of their flock o

sence of mind Was wanting to them, which was the ruin
of their tranquillity for a great while;

We=need not d'Oubt but that the governor,- and'the man
with'him, surprised with this sight, ran back immediately,
and raised their fellows, giving them an aeccount of the
imminent danger they were all 111, and- they again as
readily took the alarm, but it was impossible to persuade
them to stay close within where they were, but that they
must all run out to see how things stood.-

While it Was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and
they had opportunity enou gh; for some hours, to view
them by the light of three fires they had made at some
distance from one another. What they were doing'they
knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not; for;
first, the enemy were too many; and, secondly, they did
not keep together, but were divided intoseveral parties;
and were on shorein' several places. .

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this
sight; and' as they found that the fellows ran straggling
all over the shore, they made no doubt but, first or last,-
some of them would chop in upon their habitation, or
upon some other place, where they would see the tokens

of inhabitants, and thfy were in great perplexity also
goats, which would have been

little less than'starving them, if they should have been
destroyed. So the firsgt thing they resolved upon, was to
deep atch three men' aWay before it was light, namely, two
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats
away to the great valley where the cave was, and, if need
Were, to drive them into the very cave itself. "

Could they have seen the savages all tOg ether' 1n one
body, and at a distance from their canoes, they resolved,
if there had been an hundred of them, to have attacked
them; but that could not be obtained, for there were some
of them two miles off from the other, and, as it appeared
afterwards, were of two difi'erent nations. '

After having mused a great while on the course they
should take, and exerted themselvesin considering their
present circumstances, they resolved at last, while it Was
dark, to send the old sewage (Friday's father) out as a spy,:4 snoonr mam anti-WEEK THE SAVAGES. ' 843'

said, held two hours, before they could guess which party
would be beaten; but then that party which was nearest
our people' s habitation began to appear weakest, and,
after some time more, some of them began to fly y; and
this put our men again into a great consternation, lest
any of those that fled should run into the grove before
their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involuntarily dis
cover the place, and that, by consequence, the pursuers
should do the like in search for them. Up on this they
resolved, that they would stand armed within the wall,
and whoever came yinto the grove, they should sally out
over the wall and kill them, so that, if possible, not one
should return to give an account of it. They ordered
also, that it should be done with their swords, or by knock-
ing them down with the stock of the musket, not by
shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.
As they expected, it fell out: three of the routed army
fled for life, and, crossing the creek, ran directly into the
place, not in the least knowing whither they went, but
running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they
kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this
addition, to our men's great satisfaction, namely, that
the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way
they were gone. Upon this, the Spaniard governor, a
man of humanity, would not suffer them to, kill the three
fugitives; but, sending three men out by the top of the
hill, ordered them to go round and come in behind them,
surprise, and take them prisoners, which was done. The
residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and
got off to sea; the victors retired, and made no pursuit,
or very little, but, drawing themselves into a body together, .
gave two great screaming shouts, which they-supposed
were by way of triumph, and so the fight ended: and .the
same day, about'three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had
their island again, free to themselves, their fright was
over, and they saw no savages in several years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den, and, viewing the field of battle, they found
about two- and- thirty dead men upon the spot: some wereAt- sssvnrsor TEE near. 345

killed with great long arrows, several of which were found,
sticking intheir bodies, but most of them were killed with
great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they
' found in the field of battle, and as many bows, with a
: great many arrows; These swords were great unwieldy
_ things, and they must be very strong men that used them;
most of those men that were killed with them had their
i heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it
_ ' ~ in English, their brains knocked out, and several of their
E; arms and legs broken; so' that it is evident they fight
with inexpressible rage and fury. They found not one
.. wounded man; that was not stone dead; for either they
5;- . stay by their enemy till they have quite killed them, or
they carry all the wounded men, that are not quite dead,
.away with them. ,;V,-,->>;';rC/.-4.:~f1_vi,.>>;5 . 1 ,
.uThis deliverance tamed our Englishmen, for a great
'45 while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the con-
?i sequence appeared terrible to the last degree, especially
. ' - upon supposing that some time or other they should fall
into the hands of those creatures, who 'would not only
kill them as enemies, but- kill them for food, as we kill
our cattle" :uAndthey professed to me, that the thoughts
of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was sup-
posed it was not to be till they were dead, had something
in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very stomachs,
made them sick when they thought of it, and filled their
minds with unusual terror, that they were not themselves
'for some weeks after. '
I V This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I
have been speaking of, and, for a great while after, they .
g were very tractable, and went about the common busi-
V , ness of the whole society well enough--planted, sowed,
reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country;
' but some time after this, they fell all into such simple
" measures. again as brought them into a great deal of
" troubleu'fij'r .14 y ' .7
; ., They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed ;'
and these three being lusty, stout young fellows, they
' made them servants, and taught them to work for them -;
V and as slaves they did well enough: but they did not take
their measures'with them as I did by my man Friday;
namelyg-to begin-with them upOn the principle of having
saved their lives, and then instructed them in the rational
principles of' life, much1 less of religion, civilising and're-
ducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguings ;
but as they gave them their food' every day, so they gave
them their work too, and kept them fullyemployed in drud~
'ger'y enough ; but they failed in this by 'it, that they never
had them to assist them-and fight for them, as I had'my
man. Friday, who was as true to' me' as the very flesh
upon my bones; .

But to come to the family part: being all now good
friends (for common danger, asI said above, had effec-
tually reconciled them), they began to consider their
general circumstances; and the first thing that came
under their consideration Was, whether, seeing the sav--
ages particularly hau'nted that side of the island, and
that: there were more remote and retired" parts 0f- it
equally adapted to their way of livingyand' manifestly'to
their advantage, they should: not rather remove their
habitation, and plant it in some more proper place for
their safety, and especially for>> the security of their cattle
and corn; .

Uponthis, after long debate, it was cenceivedthat they
should' not remove their habitation, because that, some
'time'or'other, they thought they might hear from their
governor again, meaning me'y and if- I' should send any
one to seek them, I would be sure to direct them on that
side, where, ifithey should find'the place demolished, they
would conclude the savages had kflledius' all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would goiaway too; ' '

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove
them'i'nt'o the valley'where my cave was, where the land
was as prOper to'both, and where indeed there was land
enough; however; upon second thoughts, they altered
one part of that resolution too, and resolved only to re-

move par't of- their' cattle thither, and plant part of their '

corn there; and' so, if one part'was destroyed, the other
might be saved: and one' piece'of prudence they used,
which it: Was'very- Well they did, namely, that they never

A , trusted these three savages which they had taken pris-
' _ oners with knowing anything of the plantation they I)had

- made 111 that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much

. less of the cave there,- which they kep ty in case of neces-
' sity as sisafe retreat;- and thither they carried also the two

barrels of powder which I had left them at my coming
away. ~- '
But, however; they resolved not to change theirI habi-

tation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully covered

it first with a wall and fortification, and then with a grove .
of trees, so, seeing their safety consisted enti'r'ely' in their

. being concealed, of which they were now fully convinced,

they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more
effectually than before: to this purp mpose, as' II had planted
trees (or rather thrust m stakes which in- time' all grewl
toI be trees) for some good distance before the entrance
into- my apartment, they went on in- the same manner,"
and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground from

the trees I had set quite down to the side of the creek, .
where, as I said, I landed my floats, and even into the
very 0026 where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving
any place to land or any sign that there- had been any
landing 'thereabout. These stakes also being of a wood

'very forward to grow, as I had noted formerly ,they took

care to have generally yvery much larger andy taller than
those which I had planted, and placedg them so very thick
and close, that when they had been three or four: years
grown,- there'was no piercing'with the eye any consider"
able way into the plantation. As for that part which I'
had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's
thigh 3- and among them they placed so many other sh01t

' ones, and so thick, that,_in a word, it stood like a palisado
' a quarter of a mile thick, and it'was next to impossible to '

penetrate it but with a little army to cut it all down ;
fora little dog could hardly get between the trees,-they
stood so close.~

But this was not all: for' they did1 the same by all the
ground to the rig ht hand, and to the left, and round even'
to the top of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for
themselves to come out, but by the ladder placed up to
the side of the hill, and then lifted up and placed again ,

from the first stage up to the top; which ladder, when it
was taken down, nothing but what had wings or witch-
craft to assist it could come at them. '

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less
than what they afterwards found occasion for; which
served to convince me, that as human prudence has
authority of Providence to justify it, so ithas, doubtless,
the direction of Providence to set it to work, and, would
. we listen carefully to the voice of it, I am fully persuaded
we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives
are now by our own negligence subjected to; but this
by the way. '

I return to the story. They lived two years after this
in perfect retirement, and had no more visits from the
savages: they had indeed an alarm given them one
morning, which put them in a great consternatiOn; for
some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on
the west side, or rather end of the island.--which, by the
way, was that end where I never went, for fear of being

discovered--they were surprised with seeing about twenty ,

canoes of Indians just coming on shore. '

They made the best of their way home in hurry enough,
and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close
all that day and the next, going out only at night to
make observation; but they had the good luck to be
mistaken, for wherever the savageswent, they did not
sand at that time on the island, but pursued some other

eelgn. _

QHAPTER XXIV.

AND now they had another broil with the three English-

men, one of which, a most turbulent fellow, being in a

rage at one of the three slaves which I mentioned they '

had taken, because the fellow had not done something
right which he bade him do, and seemed a little untract-
able in his-showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog--

belt' in which he bore it by his side, and fell up on him,
; the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.
; One of the Spaniards who was by y, seeing him give the
'1"; fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed
at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor creature's arm ofi', ran ta
him gand, entreating him not to murder the poor man,
clapped in between him and the savage to prevent the
:; mischief.
~ ' The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck at the
Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him
as he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard
perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he
hadin his hand for they were workingin the field about the
com-land) knoc ed the brute down; another of the Eng-
lishmen running at the same time to help his comrade,
knocked the Spaniard down, and then two Spaniards more
came to help their man, and a third Englishman fell
' upon them.>> --They had none of them any fire-arms, or
any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except
the third Englishman: he had one of my old rusty cut-
lasses, with which he made at the last Spaniards, and
wounded them both. This fray set the whole family in
an uproar, and more help coming in, they took the three
Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what
should be done with them? They had been so often
- mutinous, and were so furious, so desperate, and so idle
withal, that they knew not what course to take with them,
for they were mischievous to the highest degree, and
valued not what hurt they did any man, so that, in short,
it was not safe to live with theme;
, , fix-- The Spaniard, who was governor, told thein,' in so many
5' words, that if they had been his own countrymen he
- would have hanged them all--for all laws and all gover-
nors were to preserve society, and those who were gdan-
gerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it; but
as theyiwere Englishmen, and that it was to the gener-
ous kindness of an Englishman that-they all owed their
. preservation and deliverance, he would use themwith all
possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment

of the other' :two Englishmen, who were their country:
men.

One of the two honest Englishmen then stood up ,and
said they desired it might not be left to them: " For,"
says he, "I am sure we ought to sentence him to the

gallows ;" and with that gives an account how Will
Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the five
Englishmen' Join together, and murder $.11 the Spaniards
when they were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will
Atkins: "Howl Seigm 'or Atkins," says he, "will you
murder us all? What have you to say to that '2" That
hardened villain was so far from denying it, that he said
it was true, and they would do it still before they had
done with them. "Well, but Seigm 'or Atkins,"said the
Spaniard," what have we done to you that you will kill
us P? And what would you get by killing us- ?y And what
must we do to prevent your killing us 9 Must wekill you,

Seigm or gAtkins was in such a rage at the ;pS aniard's
makingm a jest of it, that had he not been heldP by three
men, and withal had no weapons with him, it was thought
he would have attempted to have killed the Spaniard in
the middle of all the company.

This hairbrained carriage obliged them to consider
seriously what was to be done. gThe two Englishmen,
and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of
the opinionp that they should hang ,one of the three for an
example to the rest; and that particularly it should be
he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; ,and, indeed, there was some reason to believe
he had done it, for the ,poor savage was in such amiss:-

able condition with the wound he had received, that it ' '

was thought he could not live.
But the goyernor Sp _amard still said No, it was an
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would
never consent to put an Englishman to death thou ghhe
had murdered half of them--nay, he said, ,1th 'ghad been

killed ,himself. by an Englishman, and had tune leftto

speak, it should be that they should pardOn him.

"films was so positively insisted on by the governor
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it; and as mer-
'ciful counsels are most apt to prevail .where ,they are so
earnestly pressed, ,so {they all came into it; buty then it
was to be considered what should be done to keep them
from the mischief ,they designed, for all agreed, governor
and all, that means were to be .used for preserving ,the
society from dang er. Aftera long debate, it was agreed,
first, ,that they should be disarmed, and not permitted
to have eithery gun, or powder, or shot, or sword, or any
weapon, and should be turned out of the society, and
left to live when ,they would, and how they could, ,by
themselves; but that none .of the rest, ,eithery Sp aniards
or English, should converse with them,sp eak with them,
or have anything to do with them; that they should be
forbid to come within a certain distance ,of the place where
the rest dwelt; and that if they ofi'ered to commit any

', disorder, so as to spoil, burn, _ldll, ordestroy any of the

 

   
   

corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belongin ging to
the society, that they should die without mercy, and
would shoot them wherever they could find them.
1+ The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon
the sentence, .considered a little upon it, and turning to
the ,two' honest Englishmen said, "Hold, you must re.-
fiect that it will be long ,ere they can raise corn and cattle
of their own, and they 'must not starve--we must there.-
fore allow them provisions "- 180 he .oaused to be added,
that they should have a proportion of corn given them
to last them .eig ht months, and for seed to ,sow, by which
time they might be supp posed .to raise someof their own ,
that they yshould havesix milch- goats, {our he-goazts, and
six kids, given them,- as well for present subsistence {813
for a store ,4 and that [they should have techs given them
for their work 111 the field--such as, six hatches, an axe,
a saw, and the like; but they should have none .of these
tools or provisions, unless they would swear solemnly
that they would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards
with them, or their fellow Englishmen.
Thus they diSmissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away sul-
len and refractory, as neither contented to go away or to
stay; but as there was no remedy, they went, pretend-
ing to go and choose a place where they should settle
themselves, to plant and live by themselves; and some
provisions were given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after they came again for some
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they
had pitched their tents, and marked themselves out an
habitation or plantation ; it was a very convenient place,
indeed, on the remotest part of the island, north-east,
much about the' place where I providentially landed in
my first voyage when I was driven out to sea, the Lord

alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to surround

the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and

contrived them in amanner like my first habitation, being
close under the side of a hill, having some trees growing
already to the three'sides of it, so that by planting others
it would be very easily covered from the sight, unless
narrowly searched for. They desired some dry goat-skins
for beds and covering, which were given them; and
upon their giving their words that they would not disturb
the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave
them hatchets, and what other tools they could spare;
some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing, and, in a word,
anything they wanted but arms and ammunition.

They livedin this separate condition about six months, '

and had got in their first harvest, though the quantity
'was but small, the parcel of land they had planted being
but little; for, indeed, having all their plantation to
form, they had,a great deal of work upon their hands 3
and when they came to make boards, and 'pots, and such
things, they were quite out of their element, and could
make nothing of it; and when the rainy season came on,
for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling; and
this humbled them much; so they came and begged the
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did, and

natiVes there, and bring them home, so as to make them

354 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CBUSOE. '

three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning
and, in very humble terms, desired to be admitted to
speak with them: the Spaniards veryreadily heard what
they had to say, which was this, that they were tired 01
living in the manner they did, that they were not handy
enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and that,
having no help, they found they should be starved; but
if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the
canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and
ammunition proportioned for their defence, they would
go over to the main, and seek their fortune, and so de-
liver them from the trouble of Supplying them with any
other provisions. '

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them; but?

yetvery honestly represented to them the certain destruc-
tion they were running into; told them they had suffered
such hardships upon that very spot, that they could, with-
out any spirit of prophecy, tell them that they would be
starved or murdered, and bade them consider of it.

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved '

if they staid here, for they could not work, and would not
work, and they could but be starved abroad: and, if they
were murdered, there was an end of them, they had no
wives or children to cry after them, and, in short, insisted
importunately upon their demand, declaring that they
would go', whether they would give them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that,

if they were resolved to go, they should not go like naked .

men, and be'in no condition to defend themselves; and
that. though they could ill spare their fire-arms, having
not pnough for themselves, yet they would let them have
two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a
hatchet, which they thought sufficient for them.

In a word, they accepted the ofi'er; and, having baked >

them bread enough to serve them a month, and given
them as much goat's flesh as they could eat while it was
sweet, and a great basket full of dried grapes,'a pot full
of fresh water. and a young kid alive to kill, they boldly

set out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was _

at least forty miles broad '

1. The boat was, indeed, a large one, and would have
1,>> very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and, therefore,
; was rather too big for them to manage; but, as they had
, a fair breeze, and the flood-tide with them, they did well
.7 enough. :1 They had made a mast of a long pole, and a
j sail of four large goat- -skins dried, which they had sewed
or laced together, and away they went merrily enough:
~ the Spaniards called after them, "Bon veajol " and no
5 man ever thought of seeing them any more.
. ' The Spaniards would often say to one another, and the
' two honestEng lishmen who remained behind, how quietly
and comfortably they lived now these three turbulent
fellows were gone; as for their ever coming again, that
was the remotest thing from their thoughts could be
_ , imagined: when, beholdg, after twergig-two days' absence,
' one of the Englishmen being abro upon his~ planting
'3' -'- ' work, sees three strange men coming towards him at a
as; distance, two of them with guns up on their shoulders.
in Away runs the Englishman, as if he was 'bewitched,
_ and came, frighted and amazed, to the governor Span-
; ' iard, and tells him they were all undone, for there were
' strangers landed upon the island, he could not tell who.
The Spaniard, pausing a while, says to him, " How do
on mean, you cannot tell who ?' They are savages to
e sure.' -. " No, no," says the Englishman, "they are
'_ men in clothes, with arms." "Nay, then,' says the Span:
\ iard, " why are you concerned ? If they are not savages,
they must be friends; for there' is no Christian nation
up on earth but will do us good rather than harm._"_ -
r>> pWhile they were debating thus, came the three Eng .
lishmen, and, standing without the wood which was new
; planted, hallooed to them: they pyresentl knew their
. 1 voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceased. But
. now the admiration was turned up on another question,
namely, what could be the matter, Pand what made them
come back again '2
~u It was not a'glong before they brought the men in , and
V inquiring where they had been, and what they had been
doing, they gave them a full account of their voyage in
a few words, namely, that they reached the land' in two
days, or something less, but, finding the people alarmed
at their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to
fight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to
thge northward six or seven hours, till they came to a

great opening, by which they perceived that the land'
they saw from our island was not the the main, but an ,

island--that, entering that opening of the sea, they saw
another island on the rig ht hand north, and several more
west; and, being resolved to land somewhere, they put
over to one of the islands which lay west, and went bgldly
on shore--that they found the people were courteous and
friendly to them, aynd they gave them several roots, and

some dried fish, and appeared very sociable: and the ,

women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply
them with anything they could get for them to eat, and
brought it to them a great way upon their heads.

They continued here four days, and inquired, as well I I IL

as they could, of them by signs, what nations were this
Way, and that way; andy were told of several fierce and
terrible people, that lived almost every way, who, as
they made known by signs to them, used to eat men;
but, as for themselves, they said that they never ate men
or women, except'only such as they took in the wars;
and then they owned that they made a great feast; and
ate their prisoners.

sThe En ghshmen inquired when they had a feast of
that kind, gand they told them two moons ago, pointing
to the moon, and then to two fin g;ers and that their great
king had two hundred prisonersg now, which he had taken
in his war, and they were feeding them to make them
fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty
lesirous to see those prisoners; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of them
to carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned
to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, aynd then to

the rising; which was to signify, that the next morning .

at sun-rising they would bring some for them, and ac-
cordingly, the next morning they brought down five
,women and eleven men, and gave them to the Eng lishc
men to carry with them on their voyage, just as we would.::1-c.-.,-m 7., -i-_,_ :' 'r 'r-t'L; "'1

_ As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,

~ they put ofi with their boat', and came back towards the
first island, where, when they arrived, they set eight of
their prisoners at liberty, there being too many of them
. for their occasionr ' '
2: In their voyage they endeavoured to have some com.
'munication with their prisoners, but it was impossible
to make them understh anything, nothing they could
say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was ylooked
upon as going about to murder them; they first of all
' unbound them, but the poor creatures screamed at that,
' especially the women, as if they had just felt the knife'at
their throats; for they immediately concluded they were
' unbound on purpose to be killed.
1 If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same
thing; then they concluded it was for fear they should
sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill; if they

sently concluded it was to see whether he or she was fat
test and fittest to kill first; nay, after they had brought
them quite over, and begun to use them kindly, and treat
them well, still they expected every day to make a dimer
or supper for their new masters.

When thethreewanderershad giventhisunaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked
them where their new family was ? And being told that
they had brought them on shore, and put them into one
of their huts, and were come to beg some victuals for them,
they (the Spaniards) and the two other Englishmen, that
is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to
the place and see them--and did so, and Friday 8 father
with them.

When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound;
for when they had brought' them on shore they bound
their hands, that they might not take the boat and make
their escape--there, I say, they sat, all of them stark
naked. First there were three men, lusty, comely fel-
lows, well shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty

or thirty -five years of age, and five women, whereof two '.

might be iii-omy thirty to forty, two more not above twenty-
four or twenty- fi-ve, and the fifth, a tall comely maiden,-
'about sixteen or seventeen. The women were well
favoured, agreeable persons, both' m shape and features
only tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect white,
would have passed for handsome women even in London
itself, having very pleasant, agreeable cOuntenances, and
of a very modest behaviour, especially when'they came
afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they called it,
though that dress was very indifferent, it must be con-
fessed: of which hereafter.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth

to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a just char--

acter) men of the best behaviour, of the most calm, sedate
tempers, and perfect good humour, that ever I met with;
m particular, of the most modesty, as will presently ap.
pear--I say, the sight was 'very uncouth, to see three
naked men, and five naked women, all together bound,
and in the most miserable circumstances that human(1'41".P' -~ I"; I ' .' '-':':-':r.- - - '.$-,;.'ce.,tq;'.-.g- ,1;

'3 every moment to be dragged out, and have their brains
:j knocked out, and then to 3be eaten up like a fatted calf
. that' is killed for a dainty.
"The first thing they. did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday' s father, to go in and see first if he knew any of
'1 them, and then if he understood any of their speech. As
soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them,
' but knew none of them, neither could any of them un-
" derstand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except
P one of the women. I ., .5,
,W However, this was enough to answer the end, which
I Lrwas to satisfy them, that the men into whose hands they
.'7 were fallen were Christians, that they abhorred the eats
' ing of men or women, and that they might be sure they
would not be killed As soon as they were assured of
I this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward

' and presently one fell to taking up this, and another

<<9 The governor, who found that the having women
.: among them would presently be attended with some in-
conveniency, and might occasion some strife, and perhaps '
, blood, asked the three men. what they intended to do with
' these women, and how they intended to use them, whether
as servants or as women? 4- 1One of the Englishmen an-
'P L'szered very boldly an readily, that they would use them
as both. h To which a governor said, "I am not going
' to restrain you from it; you are your own masters as to
that, but this I think' is but just, for avoiding disorders
and quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that
reason only, namely, that you will all engage, that if any
of you take any of these women as a woman, or .ewife,h
. shall take but one; and that, having taken one, none860 1.1m sun anvsuruass or aosmsou onusos.

    
     
   

else should touch her, for though we cannot marry any
of you, yet it is but reasonable, that while you stay here,
the woman any of you takes should be maintained by
the man that tyakes her, and should be his wife; I mean,"
says he, " while he continues here; and that none else
should have anything to do with her." All this appeared
so just, that every one agreed to it without any difficulty.-
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they de-
signed to take any of them? But every one answered,
No: some of them said they had wives in Spain; and '
the others did not like women that were not Christians;
and all together declared, that they would not touch one i}
of them; which was an instance of such virtue as I have ' :..i
not met with 111 all my travels. On the other hand, to
be short, the five Englishmen took them every one a wife 1::
--that' is to say, a temporary wife, and so they set up a 1
new form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday s father . f'egi
lived 1n my old habitation, which they had enlarged ex-- 1' ' Vi
ceeding 1y within; the three servants, which they had taken g
in the late battle of the savages, lived with them; and 1
these carried on the main part of the colony, supplying 7 1
all the rest with food, and assisting them' 1n anything as ' '
they could, or as they found necessity required. '
But the wonder of this story was, how five such re-
fractory, ill-matched, fellows, should agree about these
women, and that two of them should not pitch up on the
same woman, especially seeing two or three of them were,
without comparison, more agreeable than the others ,
but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling
among themselves, for they set the five w'omen by them-'
selves in one of their huts, and they went all into the
other hut, and drew lots among them who should choose
first. _
He that drew to choose first, went away by himself to
the but where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched '
out her he chose; and it was worth observing, that he
that choose first took her that was reckoned the homeli-
est and the oldest of the five, which made mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at igt:

it was application and business that they were to expect
assistance' in, as much as anything else, and she proved
the best wife in the parcel.
V s When the poor women saw themselves' m a row thus,
- and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condi-
. tion returned upon them again, and they firmly believed
that they were now going to be devoured: accordingly,
'7 when the English sailor came in and fetched out one of
them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung
about her, and took their leave of her with such agonies
. and such affection, as would have grieved the hardest heart
in the world;- nor was it possible for the Englishmen to
satisfy them that they were not to be immediately mur-
dered, till they fetched the old man, Friday' 3 father, who
instantly let them know, that the five men who had fetched
them ouyt one by one, had chosen them for their wives.
"When they had done this, and the fright the women
- were in was a little over, the men went to work, and the
Spaniards came and helped them: and in a few hours
' they had built them every one a new but or tent for
their lodging apart; for those they had already were
"crowded with their tools, household stud, and provisions.
The three wicked ones had pitched farthest 0%, and the
two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of
the island, so that they continued separate as before:
and thus my island was peopled' in three places,an dgs
J I might say, three towns were begun to be planted.
an And here it is very well worth observing, that as it
often happens in the world (what the wise ends of God's .
providence are in such a disposition of things, I cannot
say), the two honest fellows had the two worst wives;
and the three reprobates, that were scarce worth hang-
ing, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed born
_ to do themselves good, nor any one else, had three clever,
.7: diligent, careful, and ingenious wives--not that the two
=' first were ill wives as to their temper or humour, for all
the five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subj ected
creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning
is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious,
. or alike cleanly and neat.1.;- ..-,--.,vw-,-\.-,m: -jr up? ,..';,._'~--._,?_;:F_ :2: PA." 3.7 . .fifiauz 34 "v". ,j, .,\;.

Another observation _I must make, to the honour of a
diligent application on the one hand, and to the disgrace
of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the other, that
when I came to the-place, and viewed the several im-

rovements, planting, and management of the several

'ttle colonies, the two men had so far outgone the three,
that there was no comparison; they had indeed both of
them as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted,
and the reason was, because, according to my rule, na-
ture dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more com
than they wanted; but the difference of the cultivation,
of the planting, of the fences, and indeed everything else,
was easy to be seen at first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place, no-
thing was to be seen but a wood; and though they had
their plantation twice demolished, once by their own
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shown
in its place, yet they had restored all again, and every
thing was flourishing and thriving about them--they had
grap pes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen anything of
that kind; and by their good ordering their vines, their

grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had also formed themselves a retreat' in the thickest part
ogthe woods, where, thou gh'there was not a natural
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incessant
labour of their hands, and where, when the mischief
which followed happened, they secured their wives and
children, so as they could never be found; they having,
by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood,
which, as I said, grew so easily, made a grove impas-
sable except 1n one place, where they climbed up to get
over the outside' part, and then went in by ways of their
own leaving.

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new settlement,
compared to what they were before, and were not so
quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity; yet one
of the certain companions of a profiigate mind never left

them,>> and that/was their idleness. It is true, they
planted corn, and made fences; but Solomon's words

 

_ vineyard of the slothful, and it- was overgrown with
V; thorns ;-"'~ for when the Spaniards came to view their
n ' crop, they could not see it in sinus places for weeds; the
' hedge had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had
gotten in and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there
a dead bush was crammed in to stop them out for the
present, but it was only shutting the stable door after
the steed was stolen; whereas, when they looked on the
colony of the other two,.there was the very face of in-
dustry and success upon all they did; there was not a
weed to be seen in all their corn, oragap in any of their
hedges; and they, on the other hand, verified Solomon's
words in another place :. "The diligent hand. maketh
rich 3." for everything grew and thrived, and they had
plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle
than the others, more utensils and necessaries within
, doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too.
3 It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and
cleanly within doors; and having learned the English
ways of dressing and cooking from one of the other Eng-
lishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's mate on board the
ship, they dressed their husbands' victuals very nicely--
whereas the other could not be brought to understand
it; but then the husband, who, as I said, had been cook's
_ mate, did it himself; but as for the husbands of the three
wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught
fish and birds ;"in aword, anything but labour, and they
_ , fared accordingly.I 4' The diligent lived well and comfort-

'firBut now I come to a scene diflerent from all that had
happened before, either to them or me; and the origin
- of the story was this :--

Early one morning there came on shore five or six
canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which you please ;
and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the
old errand of feeding upon tneir slaves: but that part

was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men
too, that they did not concern themselves about it as I
did; but having been made sensible. by theirexperience,
that their only business was to lie concealed, and that,
if they were not seen by any of the savages, they would
go 03' again quietly when their business was done, having
as yet not the least notion of there being any inhabitants
in the island--I say, having been made sensible of this,
they had nothing to do but to give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and not to show them-
selves; only placing a scout in a proper place, to give
notice when the boats went oif to sea again.

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
, the savages, that there were inhabitants there, which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony.
Afterthe canoes with the savages were gone ofi', the
Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them had
the curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to
see what they had been doing. Here, to their great sur-
prise, they found three savages left behind, and lying fast
asleep upon the ground; it was supposed they had either
been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts,

they were asleep, and would not stir when the others.

went, or they were wandered into the woods, and did
not come back in time to be taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and
perfectly at a loss what to do; the Spaniard governor,
as it happened, was with them, and 'his advice was asked,
but he professed he knew not what to do: as for slaves,
they had enough already; and as to killing them, they
were none of them inclined to that. The Spaniard gov-
ernor told me the could not think of shedding innocent-

blood; for as to em, the poor creatures had done no

wrong, invaded none of their property, and they thought
they had no just quarrel against them totake away their
lives. ,

And here I must, in justice to the Spaniards, observe,
that let all the accounts of Spamsh cruelty in Mexico and
Pam be what they will, I never met with seventeen men,THREE rnrsoxsns omensn. ' ' 365

<< of any nation whatsoever,'in any foreign country, who

and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it intheir very

nature ;' no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous pas-
sions, and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.
1*".- * Their temper and calmness had appeared in their hear-

ing the insufi'erable usage of the three Englishmen"; and

. their justice and humanity appeared now in the case of

the savages, as above.- After some consultation, they

<<resolved upon this, that they would lie still a while longer, '

till,- if possible, these three men might be gone: but <<then
the governor Spaniard recollected that the three savages
had no boat; and that if they were left toreve about the
island, they would certainly discover that there were in-
habitants in it, and so they should be undone that way.
' Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the fel- ,
lows fast asleep still; ' so they resolved to awaken'them,
and take them prisoners ;- and they did so. The poor fe1~
lows were strangely frighted 'when they were seized upon ,
and bound, and afraid, like the women, that they should be

' murdered and eaten; for it seems those people think all

the world do as they do, eating men's flesh; but they were
soon made easy as to that; and away they carried them.
7 It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them" home to their castle--J mean to my palace under the
hill--but they carried them first to the bower, where was

2 , the chief of their country work, such as the keeping the

goats, the planting the corn, &c.'; and afterwards they

'_carried them to the habitation of the two Englishmen.
.f" Herathey were set to work, though it was not much
' they had for them to do ;' and whether it was by negli-

gence in guarding them, or that they thought the fellows
could not mend themselves, I know not, but one of them
ran away, and taking into the woods, they could never
hear of him more; - ' -
They had geod reason to believe he got home again
soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages, who
came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who,
carrying on their revels as usual. went ofl' again in two
days' time. This thought terrified them exceedingly;
for they'concluded, and that not without good cause in-
deed, thatif this fellow got safe home among his comrades,
he would certainly give them an account that there were
people in the island, as also howweak and few they-were -
for this savage, as I observed before, had never been told,
as it was very happy he hadnot, how many there were,
or where they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the
fire of any of their guns, much less had they shown him

any other of their retired places, such as the cave in the '

valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had
made, and the like. -

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given
intelligence. of them was, that, about two months after

this, six canoes of savages, with about seven or eight, or -

ten men, in a canoe, came rowing along the north side
of the island, where they never used to come before, and
landed about an hour after sunrise, at a convenient
place, about a mile from the habitation of the two Eng-
lishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As the
Spaniard governor said, had they been all there, the
damage would not have been so much, for not a man of
them would have escaped: but the case differed nowvery
much; for two men to fifty were too much odds. The
two men had the happiness to discover them about a
league off, so that it, was above an hour before they
landed; and, as they landed about a mile from their huts,
it was some time before they could come at them. Now,
having great reason to believe that they were betrayed,
the first thing they did was to bind the slaves which were
left, and cause two of the three men whom they brought
with the women, who, it seems, proved very, faithful to
them, to lead them with their two wives, and whatever
they could carry with them, to their retired place in the
woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to bind
the two fellows hand and foot till they heard further.
In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on
shore, and that they bent their course directly, that way,

they opened the fences where the milch-goats were kept, >>

' and drove them all out, leaving their goats to struggleTHE SAYAGES SET FIRE TO THE HUTS. 367

into the wood whither they pleased, that the savages
might think they were all bred wild; but the rogue who
'came with them was too cunning for that, and gave them
an account of it all, for they went directly to the place.
_ Whenthe poor frighted men had secured their wives
. and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three
who came with the women, and who was at their place
' by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give
. them the alarm, and desire speedy help; and, in the
meantime, they took their arms, and what ammunition
they had, and retreated towards the place in the wood
where their wives were sent, keeping at a'distance, yet
so they might see, if possible, which way the savages took.
They had not gone far but that, from a rising ground,
they could see the little army of their enemies come on
directly to their habitation, and, in a moment more,
could see all their huts and household stufl' flaming up
together, totheir great grief and mortification; for they
had a very great loss, and to them irretrievable, at least
for some time. They kept the station for a while, till
they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves
all over the place, rummaging every way, and every place
they could think of, in search for prey, and, in particular,
for the people, of whom, it plainly appeared, they had
intelligence. _
;"- x : The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, as it was likely some of the
.wild people might come that way, so they might come
too many together, thought it proper to make another re-
treat about half a mile farther, believingfas it afterwards
ii happened, that the farther they strolled,'the fewer would
" be together. . .
,5: The next halt was at the entrance into a very thick
grown part of thawoods, and where an old trunk of a tree
' stood, which was hollow,,and vastly large; and in this
' tree they both took their standing, resolving to see what,
"might ofier.
_..,5 ,They had not stood there long, but two of the savages

them: and, a little way farther, they espied' three more -
coming after them, and five more beyond them, all coming
the same way: besides which, they saw seven or eight
more at a distance, running another way; for, in a word,
theyran every way, like sportsmen beating for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether ~
they should stand and keep their posture, or fly; but, -
after a very short debate with themselves, they considered,
that if the savages ranged the country thus before help
came, they might, perhaps, find out their'retreat in the
woods, and then all would .be lost; so they resolved to
stand- them 'there, and, if they were too many to deal
with, then- they would get to the top of the tree,rfrom
whence they'doubted not to defend themselves, fire ex-
cepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, though all
the savages that were landed, which were near fifty, were ' '
to attack them.- '

Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait for the
three, and so take the middle party, by which the two and
the five that followed would be separated; at length they .
resolved to let the two first pass by, unless they should spy
them in the tree, and come to attack them. The two first.
savages also confirmed them in this resolution, by turning
a little from them towards another part of the wood; but
the three, and the five after them, came forward directly
to the tree, asif they had known theE nglishmen Were there.

Seeing them come so straight towards them, they re-
solved to take them in a'line as they came; and as they
resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first shot
might hit them all three: to which purpose, the man who

. was to fire put three or four bullets into his piece, and
having a fair loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in
the tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting
till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so

fithat he could not miss. . '

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came _
on, they plainly saw that one of the three was the run:
away savage that had escaped from them, and they both .
knew him distinctly, and resolved that,'if possible, he ,should not escape, though they should both fire; so the
other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop
at the first shot, he should be sure to have a second.

1': But the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim;
for as the savages kept near one another, a little behind
in a fine, in a word, he fired, and hit two of them directly;
the foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head;
the second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot
through the body and fell, but was not quite dead; and
the third-had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by
the same ball that went through the body of the second;
and being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt, sat
down upon the ground, screaming and yelling 1n ahideous
manner
'1- The five that were behind, more frig hted with the noise
than sensible of their danger, stood still at first; for the
woods made the sound a thousand times bigger than it
really was, the echoes rattling from one side to another,
and the fowls rising from all parts" screaming and mak-
ing, every sort, a several kind of noise, according to their
kind, just as when I fired the firstgun that, perhaps, was
ever thot ofi in that place since itgun was an island.

5 However, all being silent again, and they not knowing
'what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they
came to that place where their companions layin a con-7
dition miserable enough, and here the poor ignorant
creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the
same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the wounded
man, talking, and, as may be supposed, mquiring of him-
how he came to be hurt; and who', it is very rationaLto
believe, told them that a flash of fire first,land immed-
iateiy after that thunder from their gods, had killed those
two and wounded him. This, I say, isrational ; for nothing
is more certain than that, as they saw no man near them,
so they had never heard agun in all their lives, or so much
as heard of a gun; neither knew they anything of kill-
ing or wounding at a distance with fire and bullets; if
they had, one might reasonably believe that they would
not have stood so unconcerned 1n viewing the fate of their
fellows, without some apprehension of their own.

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved

them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at ~ " .

the same time had no notion of their danger, yet, having
them all thus' in their power, and the first having loaded
his piece again, resolved to let fly both together among
them, and, singling out by agreement which to aim at,
they shot together, and killed, or very much wounded,
four of them, the fifth, frightened even to death, though
not hurt, fell with the rest:- so that our men seeing them
all fall tog ether, thought they had killed them all.

, The belief that the savages were all killed made out,
two men come boldly out from the tree before they had

' charged their guns again, which was a wrong step, and

they were under some surprise when they came to the
place, and found no less than four of the men alive, and
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: this-
obliged them to fell upon them with the stocks of their
muskets; and first they made sure of the runaway savage
that had been the cause yof all the mischief, and of another
that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain.
Then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled
down to. them with his two hands held up, and made pite-
ous moan to them by gestures and signs for hislife, but
could not say one word to them that they could understand.
However, they signified to him to sit down at the foot
of a tree thereby; and one of the En glishmen, with a
piece of ropevtwine which he had by great chance in his
pocket, tied his feet fast together, and gthis hands behind
him, and there they left him, and made with what speed
they could after the other two which were gone before,
fearing they, or any more of them, should find the way
to their covered place in the woods, where their wives,

and the few goods they had left, lay. They came once .

in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance;
however, they had the satisfaction to See them cross over
a valley towards the sea, the quite contrary way from that
which led to their retreat,- which they were afraid of; and
being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree where
they gleft their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was de-

livered by his comrades; for he was gone, and the two.

i ' was well there, and to make them easy, who werein fright

not; they found, therefore, everything very safe, only the
' women in a terrible fright. . While they were here, they
had the comfort of seven of the Spaniards Veoming to
their assistance; the other. ten with their servants, and
old Friday, I mean Friday's father, were gone in a body
to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were
kept there, in case the savages should go over to that side
of the country; but they did not spread so far. With the
seven Spaniards came one of the savages, who, as I said,
- were their prisoners formerly, and with them also came
the savage, whom the Englishman had left bound hand

When the Spaniards cama, the two Englishmen were>> i V.
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to . 5.
stay any longer there; but taking five of the Spaniards ' '

and themselves, .with-four muskets and a pistol among
them, and two stout quarter-staves, away they went in
quest of the savages. And first they came to the tree
where the men lay that had been killed; but it was easy
to see that some more of the savages had been there; for
they attempted to carry their dead men away, and had
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it over.
From thence they advanced to the first rising ground,
where they had stood and seen their camp destroy ed, and
where they had the mortification still to see some of the
smoke; but neither could they here see any of the savages.
They then resolved, though with all possible caution, to
go forward towards their gruined plantation; but a little
before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore,
they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in their
canoes, in order to be g.one

They Seemed sorry agt first that there was no way to
come ayt them to give them a parting blow, but upon the
whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all
their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come

and help them to rebuild, and to assist them with need-.

ful supplies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet
~ noted for having the least inclination to do anything

good, y,et as soon as they heard of it (for they living re-
mote, knew nothing till all was over), came and offered

their help and assistance, and did very friendly work for .
several days to restore their habitations, and make neces-'

saries for them; and thus,' in a little, they were set upon
their legs again.

About two days after this, they had the further satis:

faction of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving
on shore, and at some distance from them, with two
drowned men, by which they had reason to believe that
they had met with a storm at sea, which had overset some
of them, for it blew very hard the night after they went off.

However, as some might miscarry, so, on, the: otherhand, enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well
of what they had done, as of what happened to them;
and to whet them on to another enterprise of the same
nature, which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with

CHAPTER XXV.

5. .[r was five or six months after this before they heard any
i- more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes
f: they had not forgot their former bad luck, or had given
';_ over the hopes of better} when, on a sudden, they were
_ Tinvaded with a most formidable fleet of no' less than
, - -- .~ twenty- eight canoes, full of savages, armed with bows and
arrows, great clubs",wooden swords, and such like en-
} gines of war; and they brought such numbers with them,
that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost con-
_.1 sternation. .
3:}: As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
' easternmost side of the island, our men had that night to
consult and consider what to do; -,and in the first place,
_ , knowing that their being entirely concealed was their only
7 safety before, and would much more be so now, while the
3 number of their enemies was so great, they therefore re-
: solved, first of all, to take down the huts which were
2' for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to
i the old cave; because they supposed the savages would
7- go directly thither as soon as it was day, to play the old
1 game over again, though they did not now land within
7' two leagues of it. I ,.,-
m In the next place they drove away all the flock of
. goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which
j belong ed to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little
~ appearance of inhabitants anywhere as possible: and the

hext morning early they posted themselves, with all their.
force; at the plantation'of the two men, waiting for their

' coming. As they guessed, so it happened: these new in-

.vaders, leaving their canoes at the east end of the island,
came ranging along the shore, directly towards the place,
to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our
men could judge. Our army was but smallindeed; but
that which was worse, they had not arms for all "their
number neither. The whole account, it seems, stood
thus :--first, as to men----

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusil,
*but they had everyone a 'Ahalbert, 'or a long stafi', like a
quarter-staif, with a great spike of iron fastened into each
end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also every one of
our men had hatchet's. Two of the women could not be
prevailed upon, but they would come into the fight, and
they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards hadtaken

have spoken? ref, where the Indians fought with one an-

' ' The Spani'ard'governor, whom Ihave described sh often,

Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with
57 six men, was plantedP just behind a small thicket of
{j bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders, to let the
"-1; first of them pass by and then fire into the middle of
them; and, as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat,

as nimbly as he could, round a part of the wood, and so
g. come in behind the Spaniards where they stood, having

' a thicket of trees all bifore them.
1"When the savages came on, they ran straggling about
" every way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will
. - 1Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him; then, seeing
' A the rest come in a very thick throng, yhe orders three of
his men to fire, having loaded theirg muskets with six or
_ 'seven bullets a-piece, about as big as pistol bullets. How
' many they killed or Wounded they knew not; but the
, consternation and surprise Was inexpressible among the

- savages. who were frig hted to the last degree, to hear8 such
a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt; but see nobody that did it; when, in the middle
of their fright, William Atkins and his other three let fly
again among the thickest of them; and, in less than a
' _ minute, the dust three, being loaded again, gave them a

gods with thunder and lightning, and could see nobody

discovered the chgat; some of the savages, who were at a

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground -"
in the wood: and the Spaniards, after firing three vol-I
leys upon them, retreated also; for their number was so
great, and they were so desperate, that though above fifty
of them were killed, and more than so many wounded,
yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of
danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was
observed, that their wounded men, who were not quite
disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds, and
fought like madmen. '
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and
the Englishman that were killed, behind them; and the ' ' j
savages, when they came up to them, killed them over '
again, in a wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs,
and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like true
savages. But, finding our men were gone, they did not
seem inclined to pursue them, but drew themselves up
in a kind of ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and
shouted twice in token of their victory; after which, they
had the mortification to see several of their wounded.
men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood. ' "
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body
up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was
wounded, would have had him march, and charge them
again all together at once: but the Spaniard replied,
" Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight;
let them alone till morning; all these wounded men will
' be stifl' and sore with their wounds, and faint with the
loss of blood, and so we shall have the fewer to engage."
The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied, merrily,
"That's true, S'eignior, and. so shall I too; and that'sr
the reason I would go on while I am warm." " Well,
Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " you have behaved '
gallantly, and done your part; we will fight for you, if
you cannot come on ; but I think it best to stay till

' die . withgtheirhusbands. _ Having thus formed their
' little army, they marched out from among the trees, and
" came up to the teeth of the enemy, "shouting and halloo-
. ing as loud as they could. ,-, The savages stood all together,
5 but were in- the>> utmost confusion, hearing the noise of
our men shouting from- three quarters- together--they
would have foughtif they had seen us .; and as soon as
awe came near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot,
:7 and poor old. Friday Was wounded, though not danger-
,- ously. But cur men 'gavethem no time, but running up
# to them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in
' with the butt ends of their muskets, their swords, armed
' staves, and hatchets ,'-- and laid about them so well, that,
. in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling,
flying to save their lives which way sccver they could. ,
Our men were tired with the execution, and killed, or
mortally wounded, in the two fights, about one hundred
and eighty of them; the rest, being frighted out of their
wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills, with
all the speed that fear and nimble feet could help them
to do : and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue
them, they got all together to the sea-side, where they

'landed, and where their canoes lay. But their disaster
was not at 9. end yet, for it blew a terrible storm of wind
that evening from the sea-ward, so that it was imp06sible

for them to put off; nay, the storm continuing all night, - '; I

when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore,
that it required infinite toil to get them off ; and some of
them were even dashed to pieces against the beach, or
against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little
rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as well
as they could, they resolved to march to that part of the
island were the savages were fled, and to see what posture
they were in. This necessarily led them over the place
where the fight had been, and where they found several
of the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past recover-
ing life--a sight disagreeable enough to'generous minds;
for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of battle
to destroy <<his enemy, takes no delight in his misery.

' However, there was no need to give any Order in this
case; for their own Savages, who were their servants, de-
spatched those poOr creatures with their hatchets. >- ">1 ;

At length they came in view of the place where the
more miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where
there appeared about one hundred still--their posture Was
generally sitting upon the ground, with their kneesmp
towards their mouth, and the head put between the hands,
leaning down upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shot of them,
the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired
withoutball, to alarm them; this he did, that by their
countenance he might know what to expect--namely,
whether they were still in heart to fight, or were soas? rm: sovrcn or units Is women. 379

W heartily beaten, as to be disp irited and discouraged, and
--- so he might manage accordingly.
14, This stratagem took: for as soon as the savages heard
.11 the first gun, and saw the flash of the second, they started
, upon their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable ,
{ and as our men advanced swiftly towards them, they, all
ran screaming and yawling. away, with a kind of a how-
' ling noise, 'which our men did not understand, and had
never heard before, and thus they ran up the hills into
the country.
=5 At first our men had- much rather the weather had
. been calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but they
did not then consider that this might probably have been
the occasion cf their coming gagain in such multitudes as
not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many and so
-' . often, as would quite desolate the island, and starve them.
, . ' Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound,
, kept always with them, proved the best counsellor" 1n this
' case. His advice was, to take the advantage that ofl'ered,
__; and clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive
. . them ofP the capacity of ever returning any more to plague
. the island.
; . , '-' They consulted long about this, and some were against
.3 7 it, for fear of making the wretches fly into the woods, and
live there desperate; and so they .should have them to
f; hunt like wild beasts, be afraidto stir about their business,
'52, and have their plantations continually rifled, all their
_ tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life
,i of continual distress
'- '9'? Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with
., one hundred men than withy one hundred nations; that,
as they must destroy their boats, so they must destroy
4 , the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a
. word, he showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that
they all came into it; so they went to work immediately
."~ with the boats, and getting some dry wood together from.
a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire; but
1 they were so wet that they would scarce burn. How-
,' ever, the fire so burned the upper part, that it soon made
; them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the--a:--.\*'2C>>","':"z 37:

Indians saw what they were about, some of them came
running out of the woods, and coming as near as they
could to our men, kneeled down, and cried, " 0a, 0a,
Waramokoa," and some other words of their language,
which none of the others understood anything of; but
as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was
easy to understand they begged to have their boat spared, ,
and that they would be gone, and never return thither
again.

But our men were now satisfied that they had no way _ .
to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but efi'ec- .
tually to prevent any of these people from ever going
home again, depending up on this, that if ever so much
as one of them got back into their country to tell the
story, the colonyg was undone, so that, letting them know
that they should not have any mercy, they fell to work
with their canoes, and destroy ed them every one that
the storm had not destroyed before: at the sight of which,-
the savages raised a hideous cryin the woods, which our ' '

 

people heard plain enough, after which they ran about ' _

the island like distracted men; so that, in a word, our
men did not really know at first what to do with them: ' '
,Nor did the Spaniards, with all. their prudence, con-
sider, that while they made those people thus desperate, . ;
they ought to have kept good guard at the same time
upon their plantations, fogr though, it 18 true, they had
driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find
their main retreat, I-mean my old Castle at the hill, nor
the cave in the valley y, yet they found out my plantation

at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences . '

and planting about it; trod all the corn under foot; tore
up the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe;
and did our men an inestimable damage, though to them-
selves not one farthing 3 worth of service. '

Though our men were able to fight them upon all oc~
casions,g yet they were in no condition to pursue them,
or hunt them up. and down; for as they were too nimble
of foot for_our men when they found them single, so our
men durst not go about single for fear of being surrounded
with their numbers. The best was, they had no wea-'RESOLUTION T0 HUNT AND mass THE SAVAGESJSSI'

it pan; for though they had bows, they had no arrows left,
nor any materials to make any, nor had they any edged
tool or weapon among them. '
#1 The extremity and distress they were reduced to was
great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same time our
men were also brought to very hard circumstances by
them; for though their retreats were preserved, yet their
provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled; and
5 what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew
' not; the only refuge they had now, was the stock of cattle
1': they had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn '
L ' which grew there. The three Englishmen, William
Atkins and his comrades, were now reduced to two, one
,3 of them being killed by an arrow, which struck him on
. the side of his head, just under the temples, so that he
_ never spoke more; and it was very remarkable, that this
' was the same barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage
-' slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to
have murdered the Spaniards. . , '

t" I look upon their case to have been worse at this time
than mine was at any time after I had first discovered
the grains of barley and rice, and got into the method
.i of planting and raising my corn, and my tame cattle;
for now- they had, as I may say, an hundred wolves upon
,- the island which would devour everything they could
' come at, yet could be very hardly come at themselves.

5. nThe first thing they concluded when they saw what
1 their circumstances were, was, that they would, if posa
:'f sible, drive them up to the farther part of the island,
5. south-east, that if any ore savages came on shore, they
' might not find one ano er; then that they would daily
_..' hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they
'. could come at, till they had reduced the number; and if
-' they could at--last tame them and bring them to anything,
they would give them corn, and teach them how to plant,
3 and live upon their daily labour. ,

a In order to this they followed them, and so terrified
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them
fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, he would
fall down, for fear; and so dreadfufly frightened they' might be brought to some conditions that might be do:-

were, that they kept out of sight farther and farther, till .
at last our men following them, and every day almost :
killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in the
woods and hollow places so much, that it reduced them Q
to the utmost misery for want of food; and many were 7
afterwards found dead in the woods without any hurt "
but merely starved to death _
When our men found this, it made their hearts relent:
and pity moved them--especially the Spaniard governor, ,3
who was the most gentleman~like, and generous minded ,1
man, that ever I met with in my life; and he proposed, . r
if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him to 3

him, and told him how kind the others would be to them "'

would give satisfaction that they should keep in their

marched to the place where they were. The three Indian -

. live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a
' hill, where they sat ydown, ate the provisions very thank-
" fully, and were y.the most faithful fellows to their words
that could be thought of; for except when they came to
:: beg victuals, and directions, they never came out of their
-'- bounds; and there they lived when I came to the island,
and I went to see them.
v, .1 They had taught them to plant corn, make bread,
breed tame goats, and milk them--they wanted nothing
'_ but wives, and they should soon have been a nation.
3" They were confinedy to a neck of land surrounded with
.f high rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the sea
3} before them, on the south- east corner of the island--.-they
r . had land enough, and it was very good and fruitful, for
s.- they had a piece 'of land about a rymile and a half broad,
'_ and three or four miles 1n length. .
2, <<3 Our men taught them to make Wooden spades, such
as I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hat+
' chets and three or four knives; .and there they lived the
1 most subjected innocent creatures that were ever heard of.

respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which
"' was in about two years N otrbut that now and then some
' canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal, une
, " natural feasts gs' but as they were of several nations, and,
'7, perhaps, had never heard of those that came before, or the
a reason of it, they did not make any search or inq quiry
after their countrymen, ahd if they had, it would have
been very hard for them to have found them' out.
3'41: Thus, I think, I have: given a full account of all that
I; happened to them to my return; at least that was worth
" noticeafi The Indians, or savages, were wonderfully civil-
- ized by them, and they frequently went among them;
. but forbade, on pain of death, any of the Indians coming
~ to them, because they would not have their settlement

as One thing was very remarkable,- namelyathat they?
- taught the savages to make Wicker-work, or baskets; but:E

they soon outdid their masters--for they made abundance ~
of most mgemous things in wicker work--particularly all:i
sorts Of baskets, sieves, bird- -cages, cupboards, &c., as also
chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance Of
other things, being very ingenious at such work, when
they were once put 1n the way of it. Fla
My coming was a particular relief to these peOple,"}9
because we furnished them with knives, scissors, spadesyf
shovels, pickaxes, and all things of that kind which they
could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very handy,
that they came at last to build up their huts, or houses,"SS
ryhandsomely , raddling, Or working it up like baskets-.3
wo1k all the way round, which was a very extraordinary}
piece Of ingenuity, and looked very Odd, but was an ex'-'
ceedingly good fence, as well against heat as against all?
sorts of vermin: and our men were so taken Withit, that?
they got the wild savages to come and do the like for them-'2 ,5
so that when I came to see the two Englishmen' s coloniesfie
they looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like bees m:-
a hive, and as for Will Atkins, who was now become a;
very industrious, necessary ,and sober fellow, he had made: '
himself such a tent of bargket-work as I believe was never
seen. It was one hundred and twenty paces round on the:
outside, as I measured by my steps, the walls were as
close worked as a basket, in panels or squares, thirty-two;
in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet?
high: in the middle was another not above twenty-two ,.
paces round, but built stronger, being eight- -square in its:
form, and m the eight corners stood eight very strong '
posts, round the top Of which he laid strong pieces, j'oinedfi
tog ether with wooden pins, from which he raised a prya-gE
mid before the roof, of eight rafters, very handsome; ;

I assure you, and joined together very well, though he}

had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he had":
made Mself too, Out Of the Old 1ron that I had left therefii

And, indeed, this fellow showed abundance of m genuity3
in several things which he had no knowledge of: he made;
himself a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to MOVE r

V . the fire; he made himself charcoal for his work, and he
j "formed out of one of the iron crows a middling good anvil
' to hammer upon; in this manner he made many things,
i' but especially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges.
, '_ But to return to the house; after he pitched the roof of
his innermost tent, henworked it up between the rafters
' with basket-work so firm, and thatched that over again so
_ ingeniously with rice~straw, and over that a large leaf of
1. i a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as '
T as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed, he owned that
the savages made the basket-work for him - -
" {l The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round
; ff this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-
'- two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about
twenty feet distant; so that there was a space like a walk
within the outer wicker wall, and without the inner, near
twenty feet Wideulfr'fj' g. g, ., 7 g; ~ j. -' -
.vs The inner place he partitioned ofi with the same
wicker. work, but much fairer, and divided into six apart-
'.~: 1 ments, for that he had six rooms on a floor, and out of
every one of these there was a door--first into the entry,
or coming into the main tent; and another door into
>> 51: the space or walk that was round it; so that this walk
' ,1"? was also divided into six equal parts, which served not

it, by which you went first into a large room, or store-
house, twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet long, and
through that into'another not quite so long: so that in
the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which
were only to be come at through the apartments of the
7 5' inner tent, and served as closets, or retired rooms, to the

of the passage that led through the outer door to the in:
ner tent. - .1131
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen
in the world, nor a house nor tent so neatly contrived,
much less so built. In this great bee-hive lived the three '-
families--that is to say 'ngr Atkins and his companion; ':
the third was killed, but his wife remained with three
children, for she was, it seems, big with child when he
died; and the other two were not at all backward to give g
the widow heran share of everything, I mean as to their v;
corn, milk, grapes, &c1, and when they killed a kid, or
found a turtle on the shore: so that they all lived well . 7
enough, though, it was true, they were not so industrious
as the other two, as has been observed already.'
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, namely, that,
as for religion, I don't know that there was anything of _.
that kind among them; theyp retty often, indeed, put
one another' 1n mind that there was a God, by the very
common method of seamen, namely, swearing .by his
name, nor Were their poor, ignorant, savage wives much 7"
the better for having been married to Christians, as we '
must call them, for,g as they knew very little of God them- it
selves, so they were utterly incapable of entering into any - ;
disoourse with their wives about a God, or to talk any 3
thing to them concerning religi on. - j'
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say "
the wives had made from them was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty Well: and all the children
they had, which were near twenty' in all, were taught to'
speak English too, from their first learning to speak,
though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner, V
like their mothers. There were none of those children
above six years old when I came thither; for it was not
much above seven years that they had "fetched these five
savage ladies over, but they had all been pyrett fruitful,
for they had all children, more Or less. I think the cook' s ;.-~

.31; <<is I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages: they
told me readily, that they had no instances to give of
their application or ingenuity in that country--that they
.- V Were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of peOple--that,
,Q if means had been put into their hands, the? had yet so
abandoned themselves to despair, and so sunk under the
weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing
but starving. {3 One of them, a grave and very sensible
, man, told me he was convinced they Were in thewrong
i>>'---that it was not the part of wise men to give themselves
up to their misery,- but always to take hold of the helps
which reason ofi'ered, as well for present support as for
v , future deliverance>>? He told me, that grief was the most
senseless, insignificant passion in the world ;' for that it
regarded only things past,'- which were generally impos-
sible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had no view to

things to come, and had no share in anything that looked

like deliverance, but rather added to\ aflliction than pro-

f- posed a remedy ;' and upon this he repeated 9. Spanish
proverb,- which, though I cannot repeat in just the same

T" English proverb of my own, thus :-- ' p- '

J,

1 1 and pretty much of my five runagate Englishmen, I must _
ments' I had made in my solitude; my unwearied applig
cation, as he. called it, and how I had made a condition,
which, in its circumstances, was at first much worse than
theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs was,
even now when they were all together. He told me it
was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence
of mind in their distress than any people that ever he
met with--that their unhappy nation, and the Portu-
guese, were the worst men in the world to struggle with
misfortunes; for, that their first step in dangers, after
common efl'orts are over, was always to despair--lie down
under it and die, without rousing their thoughts up' to
proper remedies for escape.

I told him their case and mine difl'ered exceedingly--
that they were cast upon the shore without necessaries,
without supply of food, or of present sustenance, till they
could provide it--that it is true I had this disadvantage
and discomfort, that I was alone; but then the supplies '
I had providentially thrown into my hands, by the un-
expected driving of the ship on shore, was such a help
as would have encouraged any creature'in the world to ,
have applied himself as I had done. " Seignior," says
the Spaniard, " had we poor Spaniards been in your case,
we should never have gotten half those things out of the
ship as you did. Nay," says he, "we should never have
found means to have gotten a raft to carry them, or to
have gotten a raft on shore without boat or sail; and
how much less should we have done," said he, ." if any
of us had been alone!" Well, I desired him to abate
his compliment, and go on with the history of their com:
ing on shore, where they landed. He told me they un-
happily, landed at a place where there were people with-
, out provisions ' whereas, had they had the common sense

to have put off to sea again, and gone to another island
a little farther, they had found provisions, though with- '
out people, there being an island that way, as they had '
been told, where there were provisions, though no people
----that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had fre-
quently been there, and filled the island with goats and
hogs at several times, Where they have bred in such<<arm-J , msroav or run smuuans. 389

multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowls were in such
plenty, that they could have been in no want of flesh,
though they had found no bread; whereas here they were
only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they
, understood not, and which had no substance in them,
'11 , V and which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough,
, and who could treat them no better, unless they would
turn'cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which was the great
dainty of the country; -
. -'..They gave me an account how many ways they strove
to civilize the savages they were with, and to teach them
rational customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain;
and how they retorted it upon them as unjust, that they
who came thither for assistance and support should at-'
tempt to set up for instructors of those that gave them
bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set up'i'or
the instructors of others but those who could live without
them;

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they
were driven to; how sometimes they were many days
without any food at all, the island they were upon being
inhabited by a sort of savages thatlived more indolent,
" and for that reason were less supplied with the necessaries
of life thanthey had reason to believe others were in the
same part of the worlds; and yet they found that these
savages were less ravenous and voracious than those who
had better supplies of food. -

. Also they added, that they could not but see with what
7 demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing
- providence of God directs the event of things in the world,
, , .which they said appeared in their circumstances; for if,
'15; pressed by the hardships they were under, and the bar-
A renness of the country where they were, they had searched
after a better place to live in, they had then been out of
the way of the relief that happened to them by my means.
Then they gave me an account how the savages whom
' /they lived among expected them to go out with them into
their wars; and it was true. that as they had firearms
' _ with them, had they not had the disaster to lose their
ammunition, they should not have been serviceable only
to their friends, but have made themselves terrible both
to' friends and enemies; but being without powder and
shot, and in a condition that they could not in reason
deny to go out with their landlords to their wars, when
they came in the field of battle they were in a worse conv
dition than the savages themselves, for they neither had
bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages

gave them, so that they could do nothing but stand still
and be wounded withy arrows, till they came up to the
teeth of their enemy; and then, indeed, the three hal-

berts they had were yof use to them, and they would often.

drive a wyhole little army before them with those halberts

and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their -

musketsarpz but that for I'all this, they were sometimes
surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger from
their arrows; till at last they found the way to make

' themselves large targets of wood, which they covered

with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not,
and these covered them from the arrows of the savages:
that notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in
great danger, and were once five of them knocked down
togetherwith the clubs of the savages, which was the
time when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say,
the Spaniard whom I had relieved; that at first~they
thought he had been. killed, at when afterwards they
heard he was taken prisoner, ey were under the greatest

grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured
their lives to have rescued him.

They told me, that when they were so knocked down,
the resyt of their company rescued them, and stood over
them fighting till they were come to themselves, all but
he who they thought had been dead; and then they made

their way with _thgeir halberts and pieces, standing close . '
togethery in a line, through a body of above a thousand '

savages, beating down all that came in their way, got the
victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow,
because it was with the loss of their friend; whom the

other party, findinghim alive, carried off with some others, ' '

surprised with joy at the return of their friend and com-
anion in misery, who they thought had been devoured
, y wild beasts of the worst kind, namely, by wild men;
. . and yet how more and more they were surprised with the
account he gave them of his errand, and that there was
a Christian in a place near, much more one that was able,
and had humanity enough to contribute to their deliver-

g5.- They described how they were astonished at the sight
of the relief I sent them, and at the'appearance-of loaves
' of bread, things they had not seen since their coming to
5 that miserable place; how often they crossed it, and
blessed it as bread sent from Heaven; and what a reviv-
ing cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as also of
' the other things I had sent for their supply. And, after
' ' all, they would have told me something of the joy they
were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to cany them
. away to the personand place from whence all these new
~ comforts came ;, but they told me it was impossible to ex- '
1. press it by words, for their excessive joy driving them to
3; unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to describe
' 1 them but by telling" me that they bordered upon lunacy, .
having no way to give vent to their passion suitable to
the sense that was upon them-ethat in some it worked
, ,_ one my.- and in some another--and that some of them,
' through a surprise of joy, would burst out into tears---
:., others be half mad, and others immediately faint. This
discourse extremely afieeted me, and called to my mind>>
Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor
people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea, after their
ship was on fire; the mate of the ship's joy when he found
himself delivered in the place where he expected to perish :
f, and my own joy, when, after twenty-eight years' captivity, '
'- I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country.
All these things made me mere sensible of the relation of
- ' these poor men, and more affected with it.
4:. Having thus given a view of the state of things as I
l found them, I must relate the heads of what I did for
' these people, and the condition in which I left them. It
was their opinion. and mine too, that they would be
troubled no more with the savages; or that, if they were,
they would be able to cut them ofi', if they were twice
as many as before; so that they had no concern about
that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the

Spaniard, whom I called governor, about their stay in ' ;

the island; for I was not come to carry'any of them off;

so it would not be just to carry off some and leave others, '

who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their strength
was diminished. On the other hand, I told them I came
to establish them there, not to remove them; and then
I let them know that I had brought with me relief of
sundry kinds for them; that I had been at a great charge
to supply them with all things necessary, as well for their
convenience as their defence; and that I had such par-
ticular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit
their number, as by the particular necessary employments
which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist them
in- those things which at present they were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them:
and before I delivered to them the stores I had brought,

I asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and. .. '

buried the first animosities that had been among them,
and could shake hands with one another, and engage in
a strict friendship and union of interest, so that there
might be no more misunderstandings or jealousies. '
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness, and
good humour, said they had met with afliictions enough
to make them all sober, and enemies enough to make
them all friends; and for his part he would live and die
with them; and was so far from designing anything
against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done n0a
thing to him but what his own bad humour made neces-
sary, and what he would have done, and perhaps much

' worse, in their case; and that he would ask them pardon,

if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had
done to them; and was very willing and desirous of living
on terms of entire friendship and union with them: and
would do anything that lay in his power to convince them
of it: and as for going to England. he cared not if he did
not go thither these twenty years.

and excluded William Atkins and his two countrymen,
for their 111 conduct, as they had let me know--and they
appealed to me for the necessity they were under to do
so--but that William Atkins had behaved himself so
bravely in the great fight they had with the savages, and
on several occasions since, and had showed himself so
faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of them
all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought
he merited as much to be trusted with arms, and sup plied
:Vwith necessaries, as any of them: and that they Phad
' ' testified their satisfaction in him, by committing they com-

had an entire confidence in him, and all his countrymen,
so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence
' by all the methods that honest men could merit to be
2' ,- valued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced
; the occasion of giving me this assurance thaty they would
1' never have any interest separate from one another.

1:; Upon these frank and op en declarations of friendship,

~ we appointed the next day 1)to dine alto g;ether and, in-

' beer--:-thing s that neither the Spaniards nor the Eng lish- '

they might all take an equal quantity of the goods that 1:
were for wearing ; that is to say, equal when made up. ' At

first, I distributed linen sufficient to make every one of ' ~1
them four shirts; and, at the Spaniards' request, aftera '

wards made them up six: these were exceedingly comforts
able to them, having been what, as I may say, they had
long since forgot the use of, or what it was to Wear them. '

I allotted the thin English stufi's, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light coat like a frock, which 1
I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose; '5'!
and ordered, that whenever they decayed, they should :'
make more, as they thought fit. The like for pumps, -
shoes, stockings, and hats, &c.

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat

upon the countenances of all these poor men when they wen-12

saw the care I had taken of them, and how well I had
furnished them. They told me I was a father to them;
and that, having such a correspondent as I was, in so re.-
mote a part of the world,-- it would make them forget that
they were left in a desolate place ; and they all voluntarily
engaged to me not to leave the place, without my consent.

Then I presented to them the. people I had brought
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two
carpenters, all of them most necessary people; but above 3
all, my general artificer, than whom they could not name :
anything that was more needful to them; and the tailor,
to. show his concern for them, went to work immediately,
and, 'with my leave, made them every one a shirt the first '
thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught the
women not only how to sew and stitch, and use theneedle,
but made them assist to make the shirts for their hus-
bands, and for all the rest.

As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful
they were; for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy
things, and made them clever convenient tables, stools,
bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and everything
they wanted of that kind. '

But to let them see how nature made artlfioers at
first, I carried the carpenters to see William Atkins's

never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before,
3 nor anything so regular, and so handily built, at least of
; its kind; and one of them, when he saw it, after musing
' 'r a good while, turning about to me,---"I am sure," says
he, "that man has no need of us; you need do nothing
7 but give him tools."
: h, Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave
: every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we
3 had no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate place
" a pick-axe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw; always ap-
pointing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out,
L, they should be supplied, without grudging, out of the
1' general stores that I left behind;
e'_ -15~'.Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, ohisels, knives, scis-
sors, and all sorts of tools and. iron-work, they had with.
out tale, as they required; for no man would care to take
fl more than he wanted, and he must be a fool that would
' ' waste or spoil them on any account whatever. And for
- the use of the smith, I left two tons of unwrought iron
for a supply.
.382 My magazine of powder and arms which I brought
them was. such, even to profusion, that they could not
but rejoice at them; for now they could march, as I used
' to do,- with a musket upon each shoulder, if there was
A occasion, and were able to fight a thousand savages, if
' they had but some little advantages of situation. which
also they could not miss of if they had occasion.

; She had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no
woman in the ship but herself; but she bore it with pa-
tience. After awhile, seeing things so well ordered, and in
so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and consider-
ing that they had neither business nor acquaintance in
the East Indies, nor reason for taking so long a voyage",
I say, considering all this, both of them came to me, and

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plot of ground ' if.
allotted to them, where they had three tents or houses 57%, ,.
set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palisaded like v 'f '
Atkins's, and adjoining to his plantation. Their tents 3"
were contrived so, that they had each of them a room, a E
part to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great storehouse,
to lay all their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And
now the other two Englishmen moved their habitation
to the same place, and so the island was divided into
three colonies, and no more; namely, the Spaniards, with .j' ' -_
old Friday and the first servants, at my old habitation '5
under the hill, which wasr,'in a word, the capital city', '1'
and where they had so enlarged and extended their works; ' v'
as well under as on the outside of the hill, that they
lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never
was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I be.
lieve, in any part of theworld; for I verily behave a
thousand men might have ranged the island a month,
and if they had not known there was such a thing, and
looked on purpose for it, they would not have found it;
for the trees stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast
matted into one another, that nothing but cutting them
down first could discover the place, except the two narrow
entrances, where they went in and out, could be found,
which was not very easy. One of them was just down
at the water's edge, on the side of the creek; and it was
afterwards above two hundred yards to the place; and the
other was up the ladder at twice, as I have already for-
merly described it; and they had a large wood thick
planted, also, on the top of the hill, which contained
above an acre, which grew apace, and covered the place
from all discovery there, with only one narrow place be-
tween two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter on
that side. ' . . . i 353*:

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there
were four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left
there, with their wives and children; three savages that
were slaves; the widow and children of the Englishman
that was killed; the young man and the maid ;. and (by
the by) we made awife of her also before we went away.81.7.5525": ;

Itold him, his carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were such
people as they call heretics, but that he was not the first
Catholic that I had conversed with without falling into
any inconveniences, or carrying the questions to any
height in debate; that he) should not find himself the
worse used for being of a different opinion from us; and
if we did not converse without any dislike on either side,
upon that score, it would be his fault, not ours.

He replied, that he thought our conversation might be
easily separated from disputes; that it was not his busi:
uses to cap principles with every man he discoursed with;
and that he rather desired me to converse with him as
a gentleman than as a religieuw; that if I would give him
leave at any time to discourse upon religious subjects,
he would readily comply with it; and then he did not
doubt but I would allow him also to.defend his own opi-
nions as well as he could; but that, without my leave, he
would not break in upon me with any such thing.

He told me, further, that he would not cease to do all
that became him in his oflice of a priest, as well as a
private Christian, to procure the good of the ship, and
the safety of .all that was in her; and though perhaps
we would not join with him, and he could not pray with
us,,he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do
upon all occasions.' In this manner We conversed ; and
as he was of a most obliging gentleman-like behaviour,
so he was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good

one morning, for he lodged amdng us all the while we
were upon the island, and it happened to be just when" a;
I was going to visit the Englishmen' s colony, at the far- :1
thest part of the island--I say, he came to me, and told ,-
me, with a very grave countenance, that he had for two
or three day s desired an opportunity of some discourse
with me, which he hop ed would not be displeasing to
me, because he thought it might, in some measure, cor-
respond with my general design, which was the prosperity
of my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least
more than he yet thought it was, in the way of God's
blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course, and turning a little short, "How, sir," said I,
" can it be said that we arenot in the way of God's bless-
ing, after such visible assistances and wonderful deliver-
ances as we have seen here, and of which I have given
you a large account ?"

"If you had p,1eased sir," said he, with a world of
modesty, and yet with great readiness, "to have heard 4:
me, you would have found no room to have been dis- . ' 3
pleased, much less tothink so hard of me, that I should
suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and
deliverances; and I hope. on your behalf, that you are
in the way of God's blesssing, and your design is exceed-
ingly good, andwillprosper. But, sir," said he, " though
it were more so than" is even possible to you, yet there
may be some among you that are not e qyuall right In
their actions; and you know, that inthe story of Israel,
one Achan in the camp removed God's blessing from
them, and turned his hand so against them, that thirty-
six of them, though not concerned in the crime, were the
objects of divine vengeance and bore the weight of that
punishment. 9"

I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told
himhis inference was so just, and the whole design seemed
so sincere, and was really so religious in its own nature, ' :1;
that I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begged , '3?
him to go on; and, in the meantime, because it seemed '
that what we had both to say might take up some time,

told him' I was going to the Englishmen's' plantation,
and asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of
it by the way. He told me he would more willingly wait
on me thither, because there, partly, the thing was acted
which he desired to speak to me about. ' So we walked on,
and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in what
e had tosay.

3 fafi'Why, then, sir," says he, "be pleased to give me
I leave to lay down a few propositions as the foundation
' of what I have to say, that we may not differ in the general
.1 principles, though we may be of some difiering opinions
. in the practice of particulars. First, sir, though we
differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion and it
~ is very unhappy that it is so, especially in the case efore
i7 us, as I shall show afterwards), yet there are some general
': principles in which we both agree, namely,>> first, that
- there is a God, and that this God, having given us some
j'stated general rules for our service and obedience, we
' ought not willingly and knowingly to ofl'end him, either
L by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by doing
SS what he has expressly forbidden; and let our different re-
; ligions be what they will, this general principle is readily
i owned by us all, that the blessing of "God dees not or-
} dinarily follow a presumptuous sinning against his com-
fmand; and every good Christian will be affectionately
' , concernedto prevent any that are under his care, living
in atotal neglect of God and his commands. Itis not your
1 men being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be .of

' souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that
,'they should live in as little distance from, and enmity

' leave to meddle so far in your circuit."

him I granted all he, had said; and thanked him that he
would so far concern himself for us ; and begged he would
explain the particulars of what he had observed, that,-

was no clergyman or priest of any kind, or of any pro-,s'
fession, to perform the ceremony; nor any pen and ink,-

or paper, to write downa contract of marriage, and have A. 4
it signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the

Spaniard governor has told you--I mean of the agreee fi'j- '.
ment that he obliged them to make when he took these '-
women, namely, that they should choose them out by 58"-
consent, and keep separately to them ; which, by the way, '1',

is nothing of a marriage, no agreementwith the women f;

as wives, but only an agreement among themselves, to ,1};'

keep them from quarrelling. . .51
But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony
(so he called it, being a Roman) consists not 'only in the

mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man ' :27
and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that there _ , f
is in the contract to compel the man and woman at all
tines to own and acknowledge each other--obliging the g}
man to abstain from all other women, to engage in no 51:"
other contract while these subsist; and, on all occasions; ;

as ability allows, to provide honestly for them and their
children; and to: oblige the woman to the same, or. like

conditions, on their side. ' "I'lfliii'

  

"Now, sir," says be," these men may, when they

,
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these women,
disown their children, leave them to perish, and take
other women and marry them whilst these are living.'
'And here he added, with some warmth, " How, sir is
God honoured' in this unlawful liberty? And how shall
a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, how-
>> ever good in themselves, and however sincere in your
design, while these men, who at present are your subjects,
under your absolute government and dominion, are

allowed by you to live' in open adultery?"

~. I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much
, more with the convincing arguments heg supported it with.
For it was certame true, that though they had no clergy-
, man on the spot, yet a formal contract on both sides,
made before witnesses, and confirmed by any token which
they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had been
' but the breaking a stick between them, ' engaging the
men to own these Women for their wives upon all occa-
sions, and never to abandon them or their children, and
the women to the same with their husbands, had been an

i ' effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God ;' and it was

a great neglect that it was not done.
- But I thought to have gotten off with my young priest
by telling him, that all that part was done when I was
not here;'- and they had lived so many years with them
now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy, they
could do nothing in it now.
" " Sir," says he, " askingy our pardon for such freedom,
you are right in this--that it being done in your absence,
.- you could not be charged with that part of the crime.
, But I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are not
therefore under an obligation to do your uttermost now
' to put an end to it. How can you think, but that, let

I . . the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt for the

future will lie entirely upon you ? Because it' is certainly

in your pOWer now to put an end to it, and in nobody}: s

power but yours. '

. I was so dull still, that I did not take him rig ht, but
' I imagi ned that, by putting an end to it, he meant that

I should part them, and not suffer them to live together5'.

any longer; and I said to him I could not do that by any
means, for that it would put thewhole island in'cong
fusion. He seemed surprised that I should so far mis-
take him. " No, sir," says he, " I do not mean that you
should separate them, but legally and effectually marry
them now. And, sir, as my way of marrying may not:
be so easy to reconcile them to, though it will be as
effectual even by your own laws, so your way may be as
well before God, and as valid among men--I mean by a
written contract signed by both man and woman, and by
all the witnesses present; which all the laws of Europe
would decree to be valid." . . m.
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much
sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his
discourse, as to his own party or church, and such a'
true warmth for the preserving people that he had no
knowledge of or relation to--I say, for preserving them
I from transgressing the laws of God--the like of which I
had indeed not met with anywhere; But recollecting"
what he had said of marrying them by a written contract,
which I knew would stand too, I returned it back upon
him, and told him I granted all that he had said to be
just, and on his part very kind; that I would discourse.
with the men upon the point now when I came to them.
And I knew no reason why they should Scruple to let
him marry them all; which I knew well enough would '.
'be granted to be as authentic and valid in England, as if
they were married by one of our own clergymen. ,,-What "
was afterwards done in this matter,,I shall speak of by

I_then pressed him to tell me what was the second
complaint which he had to make, acknowledging I was
very much his debtor for the first, and thanked him >>
heartily for it: ' He toldme he would use the same free-3
dom and plainness in the second, and hoped I would take '
it as well;-and. this was, that, notwithstanding these ,
English subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived g
with these women for almost seven years, and had taught '
theni to speak English, and even to read it, and that they _.
were, as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, ,. ' '.'oomasuron wrrxrrns FRENCH PRIEsT. ., 405

and capable Of instructiOn, yet they had not to this hour
taught them anything of the Christian religion; no, not
so much as to know that there was a God or a worship, or
in what manner God was to be served ; or that their own
idolatry, and worshipping they knew not whom, was false
and absurd. .

K This, he said, Was an unaccountable neglect, and what
God would certame call them to an account for; and,
perhaps, at last take the work out of their hands. He
spoke this very afi'ectionately and warmly. " I' am per-
suaded? says he, "had those men lived in the savage
1, country whence their wives came, the-savages would have
;~; taken more pains to have brought them -to be idolators,
4} and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so far
as I can see, has taken with them to teach them the
knowledge of the true God. Now, sir," said he, "though
I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we
2; should be all glad to see the devil's servants, and the sub-
' jects- of his kingdom, taught to know the general princi-
ples of the Christian religion--that they might at. least
hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resurrection,
; and 'of a future state, things which-we all believe--they
F? had at least been so much nearer coming into the bosom
of the true church, than they are now in the public pro-

a: I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, an

1; embraced him with an excess of passion. "How far,"
said I to him, "have I been from understanding the most
essential part of a Christian, namely, to love the interest

" we must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is
our business to assist them, encourage them, and instruct
them . and if you will give me leave, and God His bless-
ing ,I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be
brought home into the great 1)circle of Christianity ,if not
into the particular faith that we all embrace; and that
even while you stay here." Up on this I said, "I shall
not only give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks
for i ." What followed on this account, I shall mention
also again in its place.

I now ressed him for the third article in which we
were to b ame. "Why ,really," says he, " it is of the
same nature, and I will proceed (asking your leave) with
the same plainness as before: it 1s about your poor sav-
ages yonder, who are, as I may say, your conquered sub-
jects, It 1s a maxim, sir, that rs, or ought to be, received
among all Christians, of what church or pretended church

soever, namely ,that Christian knowledge ought to be pro- -

pagated by all possible means, and on all possible occa-
sions. It 1s on this princip ple that our church sends
missionaries into Persia, India, and China , and that
our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in
the most hazardous voyage, and the most dangerous re-
sidence among murderers and barbarians, to teach them
the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over
to embrace the Christian faith: Now, sir, you have an
opportunity here to have six or seven-and-thirty poor
savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of
God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you
can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is
really worth the expense of a man's whole life."

I-was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word
to say; I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God
and religion before me, let his particular principles be of
what kind soever. As for me, I had not so much as enter-
tained a thought of this in my heart before, and I behave
should not have thought of it: for I looked upon these
savages as slaves, and people whom, had we any work
for them to do, we would have used as such, or would
. have been glad to have transported them to any other

part of the world; for our business was to get rid of them,

a and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent

to any country, so that they had never seen their .own.

' But to the case: I say I was confounded at his discourse,

and knew not what answer to make him. He looked ear-
nestly at me, seeing me in some disorder: " Sir," said he,
" I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives'you any
offence." " No, no," said I, " I am oflended with nobody
but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to
think that I should never take any notice of this before,
but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now.
You'know, "sir," said I, "what circumstances I am in: 1
am bound to the East Indies, in a ship frighted by mer-
chants, and to whom it would be an insufi'erable piece of
injustice, to detain their ship here, the men lying all this
while at victuals and wages upon the owners' account.
It is true. I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and
if I stay more I must pay three pounds sterling per day
demurrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight
days more, and I have been here thirteen days already;
so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work,
unless I would sufi'er myself to be left behind here again:
in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any
part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition
that I was left in here at first, and from which I have
been so wonderfully delivered." '

m--He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my
voyage, but laid it home upon my conscience, whether
the blessing of saving seven-and-thirty souls was not
worth my venturing all I had in the world for ?" _I was-
not so sensible'of that as hetwas,' and I returned upon
him thus : " Why, sir, it is a valuable thing indeed to be
an instrument in God's hand to convert seven-and-thirty
heathens to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are an
ecclesiastic, and are given over to that work, so that it
seems naturally to fall into the way of your profession,
how 'is it then that you do not rather 'ofl'er yourself to
undertake it, than press me to it?" ' _1 ,

along, and putting me to a full stop, mademea very low

bow 'z. "' I'most heartily thank God, and you, sir," says he,
"for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work;-
and if you think yourself discharged from it, and desire
me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it
a happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such
a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I
have dropped at last into so glorious a work."

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he
spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face
glowed, and his colour came and went as if he had been
falling into fits--in a word, he was fired with the joy of
being embarked in such a work. I paused a considerable
while before I could tell what to sa to him, for I was
really surprised to find a man of suc sincerity and zeal,
and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of
men, not of his profession only, but even of any profession
whatsoever. But after I had considered it a while, I asked
him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt on
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island
for perhaps his life, and at last might not know whether
he should be able to do them any good or not ? .

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called
a venture? " Pray, sir,". said, he, "what do you think I
consented to go in your ship to the East Indies for ?"
" Nay," said I, "that I know not, unless it was to preach
to the Indians." f'Doubtless, it was," said he, " and do
you think if I can convert these seven-and-thirty men to
the faith of Christ, it is not worth my time, though I
should never be fetched off the island again? Nay, is it'
not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than .
my life is, or the life of twenty more of the same profes-
sion ? Yes, sir," says he, " I w0uld give Christ and the
Blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made the
least happy instrument of saving the souls of these poor

' men, though I was never to set my foot ofl' this island,

or see my native country any more. But since you will
honour me," says he, _"with putting me into>> this work
fifor which I will pray for you all the days of my life),

have one humble petition to you," says he, "besides.'.'..-00anssariou WITH run FRENCH pmss'r. 409_

"What-is that?", said I. "Why," says he, "it is that ,
you will leave your man. Friday with me, to be my inter-
preter to them and to assist me ;' for without some help
._ I cannot speak to them; or they to me."

' A ;..I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, be-
cause I could not think of parting with him, and that for
many reasons. He had been the companion of my tra-
vels: he was not only faithful to me, but sincerely afi'ec-
tionate to the last degree; and I had resolved to do
something considerable for him if he outlived me, as it
was probable he would. Then I knew that as I had bred
E'riday'up to be a Protestant, it would quite confound
him to bring him to embrace another profession; and he
would never, while his eyes were open, believe that his
old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and this
might in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so
turn him back again to his first idolatry.

. However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait,
and it was this: I told him I could not say that I was
willing to part with Friday on any account whatever;
though a work that to him was of more. value than his
life, ought to me to be of much more value than the keep-
ing or parting with a servant. But, on the other hand,
I was persuaded that Friday would byno means consent
to part with me; and then to force him to it without his
' consent, would be manifest injustice, because I had pro-

misedI would never put him away, and he had promised
and engaged to me that he would never leave me unless
I put him away.

7 He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had no
' rational access to these poor people, seeing he did not
' understand one word of their language, nor they one word
of his. To'remove this difiiculty, I told him that Friday's
:z, -' father had learned Spanish, which I found he also under-
Ts stood, and he should serve him for an interpreter; so he

When' we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them'all
together; and after some accounts given them of what 1' 7
had done for them, namely, what necessary things I had '
provided for them, and how they were distributed, which
they were sensible of, and very ythankful for, I began
talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and gave
them a full account of the notice the clergyman had al-
ready taken of it; and, arguing ghow unchristian and 11'1'6'
ligi ous a life it was, I first asked, if they were married
men or bachelors ? They soon explained their condition
to me, and showed me that two of them were widowers,
and the other three were single men, or bachelors. ' I
asked them with what conscience they could take these
women, and call them their wives, and have so many
children by them, and not be married lawfully to them?

They all gave me the answer that I expected, namely,
that fillers was nobody to marry them, that they agreed
before the governor to keep them as their wives, and to
keep them and own them as their wives; and they thought,
as things stood with them, they were as legally married
as if they had been married by a parson, and with all the
formalities' m the world.

I told them, that no doubt they were married' 1n the
sight of God, and were bound in conscience to keep them

, as their wives; but that the laws of men being otherwise,

they might pretend they were not married, and so desert _
the poor women and children hereafter; and that their
wives,being poor, desolate women, friendless and money--
less, would have no way to help themselves. I therefore
told them, that unless I was assured of their honest 1n-
tent, I could do nothing for them; but would take care-
that what I did shouldg be for the women and children
without them; and that unless they would give some as-
surances that they would marry the women, I could not
think it was convenient they should continue tog ether as
man and wife; for that it was both scandalous to men
and offensive to God, who they could not think would
bless- them, if they went on thus. -

All this passed as I expected, and they told me, espe-
cially Will IAtkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest,- .' rnn ENGLISHMEN AGREE TO an MARRIED. 411,

  
 
  
  
  
   
  
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
   
    
   
  
 
 
  

that they loved their wives as well as if they-had been
born in their own native country,' and would not leave
,7 them upon any account whatever; and they did verily
' believe their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and
. did, to the utmost of their sldll, as much for them and for
' their children as any women could possibly do, and they
, ' would not part with them on any account: and Will

'_ take him away, and offer to carry him home to England,
__ and to make him captain of the best man-of-war in the
' " navy, he would not go with him if he might not carry his
' - wife and children with him; and if there was a clergy-
'| ' man in the ship, he would be married to her now with
all his heart. _
- 435} This Was just as I would have it. The priest was not
' with me at that moment, but was not far 011'. So, to try
v him further, I told him I had a clergyman with me, and
if he was sincere, I would have him married the next
morning, and. bade him consider of it, and talk with the
rest/"He said, as for himself he need not consider of it
. ' at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I'had
a minister with me; and he believed they would be all
willing also. Ithen told him that my friend the minis-
ter was a Frenchman, and could not speak English, but
that I would act as clerk between them. He never so
' . much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protest-
ant', which was indeed what I was afraid of--but, I say,
they never inquired about it. So we parted; I went back
to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with
his companions. I desired the French gentleman not
; to say anything to them till the business was thorough
ripe, and I told him what answer the men had given
mead ' "
_ .-. Before Iwent from their quarter, they all came to me,
, and told me, they had been'considering what I had said;
that they were very glad to hear that I had a clergyman
in my company; and they were willing to give me the
satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married as soon
as I pleased, for they were far from desiring to part from
their wives, and that they meant nothing but what was412 LIFE AND ADVENTURES or ROBINSON onuson.

very honest when they chose them. So I appointed them
- to meet me the next morning, and that in the meantime
they should let their wives know the meaning of the mar-
riage law: and that it was not only to prevent any scan-
dal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake;
them whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning
of the thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as in-

deed they had reason to be; so they failed not to attend ' ,

all tog ether at my apartment next morning, where I
brought out my clergyman; and though he had not on a

minister's gown, after the manner ogf England, or the .

habit of a priest, after the manner of France, yet, hav-
ing a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash
round it, he did not look very unlike a minister; and as
for his language, I was interpreter.

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the
scruple he made of marrying the women because they
were not baptised, and professed Christians, gave them
A an exceeding reverence for his person, and there was no

need, after that, to inquire whether he was a clergyman
or no.

Indeed, I was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so far as that he would not have married them
at all: nay ,notwithstanding all I was able to say to him,
he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and
at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
first talked with the men and the women too; and though
at first I was a litttle backward to it, yet at last I agreed
to it with a goodwill, perceiving the sincerity of his design

When he came to them, he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the
present design; that he was very willing to perform that

'1) part of his function, and marry them as I had desired,
but that, before he could do it, arryhe must take the liberty
to talk with them. He told them that in the sight of
all different men, and in the sense of the laws of society,
they had lived all. this while in open wickedness; and

- that it was true that nothing but the consenting to marry,
or effectually separating them from one another now.

3 could put an end to it; but there was a difficulty in it
2 too,lwith respect to the law of Christian matrimony,-
' which he was not fully satisfied about, namely, that of
marrying one that is a professed Christian to a savage,
an idolator, and a heathen, one that is not baptised; and
yet that he did not see that there was time left for it to
endeavour to persuade the women to be baptised, or to
profess the name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted,
heard nothing of, and without which they could not be
baptised. '

:I' He told them he doubted they were but indifferent

Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
- ledge of God or his ways, and therefore he could not ex-

pect that they had said much to their wives on that head

yet; but that unless they would promise him to use their

endeavours with their wives to persuade them to become
'Christians, and would, as well as they could, instruct
' them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them,
and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could
not marry them; for he would have no hand in joining
Christians with savages--nor was it consistent with the
principles of the Christian religion, and Was, indeed, ex-
pressly forbidden in God's law. '
a They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered
it very faithquy to them from his mouth as near his own
. words as I could, only sometimes adding something of
my own, to convince them how just it was, and how I
was of his mind; and I always very faithfully distin-
guished between what I said from myself, and what
were the clergyman's words. They told me,;it was very
true what the 'gentleman had said, that they were but
very indifferent Christians themselves, and that they had
never talked to their wives about religion. " Oh, sir,"
says Will Atkins, " how should we teach them religion '2
Why, we know nothing ourselves ; and besides, sir," said
he, "should we go to talk to them of God, and Jesus.

laugh at us, and ask us what we behave ourselves; and

wicked people to the devil, they would ask-us where we
intended to go ourselves, who believed all this and yet
are such wicked fellows, as we indeed are: why sir," said
Will, "'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion, at
first hearing: folks must have some religion themselves
before they pretend to teach other people." " Will
Atkins," said I to him, "though I am afraid what you
say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your
wife that she is in the wrong--that there is a God, and
a religion better than'her own--that her gods are idols,
N". that they can neither hear ' nor speak~--that there is
.. great Being that made all things, that can destroy'all
that he has made--that he rewards the good, and pun-
ishes the bad--that we are to be judged by him, at last,
for all we do here? You are not so ignorant but even
nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and I
am satisfied that you know it all to be true, and believe

it yourself." "That's true, sir," said Atkins; " but with i

what face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when
she will tell me immediately it cannot be true."

"Not true!" said ~I, "what do you mean by that?"
"Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me it cannot be true
tha' this God (I shall tell her of) can be just, or can punish
or a' ward, since I am not punished and sent to the
devil, that have been such a wicked creature as she knows
I have been, even to her, and to everybody else; and
that I should be suffered to live, that have been always
acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good, and
to what I ought to have done." '

"' Why, truly, Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou
speakest too much truth ;" and with that I let the clergy?-
man know what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to
know. "Ohl" _said the priest, "tell him there is one
thing will make him the best minister in the world to his
wife, and that is, repentance; for none teach repentance

' like true penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and
then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct
his wife: he will then be able to tell her that there is
not only a God, and that he is the just rewarder of good
and evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and, with, in-

thoselthat offend--waiting to be gracious, and willing
not the death of a sinner,.but rather that he should return
- A and live--that he often suffers wicked men to go along
time, and even reserves damnation to the general day of
retribution--that it is a clear evidence of God and of a
future state, that righteous men receive not their reward,
or: wicked men their punishment, till they come into
another world; and this will lead him to teachhis wife
' the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the last judg-

'ment: let him but repent for himself, he will be an ex-
cellent preacher of repentance to his wife."

. z I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious
all the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was
more than ordinarily affected with it: when, being eager,

i and hardly suffering me to make an end--" I knew all
L this, master," says he, "and a great deal more; but I-
- han't the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God ,
and my own conscience knows, and my wife will be an

undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived as if I
had never heard of God, or a future state, or anything
about it: and totalk of repenting, alas I " (and with that
he fetcheda deep sigh, and I could see that tears stood.

. in his eyes) " 'tis past that with me." " Past it, Atkins! "
said I; '5 what dost thou mean by that ? " "I know well
enough what I'mean,vsir," says he ; "I mean it is too
late, and that is too true."

- 'I told the clergyman word'for word what he said. The
poor zealous priest SI must call him so : for, behis opinion
what zit-will, he ha certainly a most singular affection
for the good of other men's souls; and it would be hard to
thinkhe had not the like for his own)---I say, this zealous,
affectionate man, could not refrain from tears also; but,
recovering himself, he said to me, "Ask him but one
question: Is he easy .that :it is too late, or is he troubled,
and wishes it were not so ? " I put the question fairly
to Atkins; and he answered, with a great deal of passion,
',' HOW could any man be easy in a condition that cer-

tainlymust end in eternal destruction?"

his face, when I told him'all this; but turning quick to
me upon it, said, "If that be his case, you may assure

him it is not too late; Christ will give him repentance;

and we that are ChriSt's servants are commanded to

preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, '
. to all those that sincerely repent; so that 'tis never too ,

late to repent."

. I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great ear-I
. nestness; but it seemed. as if he turned ofi the discourse;

to the rest; for he said to me he would go and have some
talk with his wife ; so he went out a while and we talked to
the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to
matters of religion--much as I was when rambling away
from my father--and yet there were none of them back-,
ward to hear what had been said ; and all of them
seriously promised that they would talk with their wives

about it, and do their endeavour to persuade them to '

turn Christians.

Upon this discourse, and the men promising to per-
suade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married the
three couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet
come in. After this, the clergyman waiting a while, was
curious to know where Atkins was gone ; and turning to

'me, says, "I entreat you, sir, let us walk out here and
look; I dare say we shall find this poor man somewhere
or other, talking seriously with his wife, and teaching
her already something of religion." I began to be of the
"same mind; so we went out together, and I carried him
a way which none knew but myself, and where the trees
were so thick set, as that it was not easy to see through
the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to
see out; when, coming to the edge of the wood, I saw
Atkins, and his tawny savage wife, sitting under the
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped short
till my clergyman came up to me, and then, having
showed him where they were, we stood and looked very
steadily at them good while.

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up
to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens; then
down to the earth, then out to the sea. then to himself.

then to her, to the woods, to the trees. "Now," says
my clergyman, " you see my words are made good; the
'* man preaches to her--mark him--now he is telling her
71 V that our God has made him, and her, and the heavens,
I the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c." "I believe |
he is," said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkins
start up upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift
up both his hands; we supposed he said something, but
we could not hear him--it was too far off for that: he
did not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and
sits down again by his wife, and talks to her again.' We
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether
she said anything or no, we could not tell. While the
poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the tears
run plentifufly down my clergyman's cheek; and I could
.1 hardly forbear myself; but it was a great affliction to us
both, that we were not near enough to hear anything
that passed between them. _
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear of
disturbing them; so we resolved to see an end of this
piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us
without the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have
said, close-by her, and talked again earnestly to her, and
two or three times we could see him embrace her passion-
ately; another time we saw him take out his handker-
chief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a
kind of transport very unusual; and after several of these
things, we saw him on- a sudden jump up again and lend
her his hand to help her up, when immediately leading
her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down
together, and'continued so about two minutes.
" ' My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud,
V: "St Paul, St Paul, behold, he prayeth I" I was afraid
[.2 Atkins would hear him; therefore I entreated him to'
withhold himself a while, that we might see an end of
the scene, which,'to me, I must confess, was the most
affecting, and yet the most agreeable, that ever Isaw in
my life. This continued about half a quarter of an hour,
, and then they walked away too; so that we could see no
' _ more of them in that situation.

Itook this interval to talk with my clergyman ; and first *
I told him, I was glad to see the particulars we had both 7
been witnesses to; that though I was hard enough of be-

    
 

lief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was all very 5 .'
sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however ignor- ..

ant they both might be; and I hoped such a beginning

would have yet a more happy end: "And who knows," I; I'
said I, " but these two may in time, by instruction and iii j

example, work upon some of the others ?" "Some of
them I" said he, turning quick upon me, " ay, upon all of '
them: depend upon it, if those two savages for he has
been but little better, as you relate it) sho d embrace '
Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all =
the rest; for true religion is naturally communicative, -
and he that is once made a Christian will never leave a
Pagan behind him, if he can hel it." I owned it was a ~
most Christian principle to think so, and a testimony of
a true zeal, as well as a generous heart in him.

CHAPTER XXVII.

As Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business
there was over; so we went back our own way; and when

we came back, we found them waiting to be called in. ' t":

Observing this, I asked the clergyman, if we should dis-
cover to him that we had seen him under the bush, or
no; and it was his opinion we should not ; but that we
should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to
us: so we called himin alone, nobody beingin the place '
but 'Ourselves; and I began with him thus :-- -

"Will Atkins," said I, "prithee what education had
you 9' What was your father 9"

Atkins. A better man than ever I shall be, sir: my
fatherwas a clergymani

'35 Crusoe. It 1s true, Solomon says, "He that despiseth
;: reproof is brutis. "
: '7; Atkins. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed, I murdered my
I father: for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir,
' --I murdered my poor father.
aPriest. Ha! a murderer? -
aHere the priest stared (for I interpreted every word as
he spoke it), and looked pzale it seems he believed that
'; WillP had really killed hisp own father.
'1 7 ' Crusoe. No, no sir, Ido not understand him so. Will
Atkins, explain yourself. you did not kill your father,
'did you, with your hands '1'
1 Atkins. No, sir, I did not cut his throat, but I cut the
- thread of all his comforts. and shortened his days: I
broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return
1 . for the most tender, affectionate treatment that ever
' x father gave, or child could receive.
.' Crusoe. Well, I did not ask you about your father to
extort this confession; I pray God give you repentance
. for it, and forgive you that and all your other sins: but
,. 3 I asked you, because I see that, though you have not
much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are
> in things that are good; that you have known more of
7 religion a great deal than you have practised.
: - Atkins. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession
': >>. that I make about my father, conscience does: and when-
ever we come to look back upon our lives, the sins against
our indulgent parents are certainly the first that touch
us; the wounds they make lie deep est; and the weight
they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind of all the sins
.1 we can commit.
:3 " Crusoe. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me,
' Atkins, I cannot bear it.
3' Atkins. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it. '
f' Crusoe. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, I
' 'may say every tree, in this island, is witness to the an-
guish of my soul for my ingratitude, and base usage of a >>
A good tender father--a father much like yours by your
fiescription-g' and I murdered my father as well as you;
Will Atkins; but think, for all that, ,my repentance is .
short of yours too by a great deal.

I would have said more if I could have restrained my
passions: but I thought that this poor man's repentance
was so much sincerer than mine, that I was going to
leave ofi' the discourse and retire: for I was surprised _
with what he said, and thought, that instead of my going
about to teach and instruct him, the man was made a
teacher and instructor to me, in a most surprising and
unexpected manner. I

I laid all this before the young clergman, who was
greatly afi'ected with it, and said to me, " Did I not say,
sir, that when this man was converted, he would preach
to us all? I tell you, sir, if this one man be made a
true penitent, here will be no need of me--he will make ..
Christians of all in the island." But having a little ..
composed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will ..
Atkins. , '

"But, Will," said I, "how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now ?" '

-Atkins. Sir, you, have set me about a work that has .-
struck a dart through my very soul: I have been talk-
ing about God and religion to my wife, in order, as you ' '
directed me, to make a Christian of her; and she has '
preached such a semen to me as I shall never forget
while I live. _ -

Crusoe. No, no: it is not your wife has preached to
you ; but when you were moving religious arguments to
her, conscience has flung them back upon you.

Atkins. Ay, sir, with such a force as is not to be re- '
sisted. , ..

Cmoe. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between '
you and your wife; for I know something of it already.

Atkins. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account
of it: I am toopfull to hold it, and yet have no tongue
to express it ;>>>> but let her have said what she will, and ;
though I cannot give you an account of it, this I can tell ' =.1
you of it, that I resolve to amend and reform my life. '

Crusoe. But tell us some of it. How did you begin,

ertain ; she has preached a sermon indeed, if she has

'.wrought this upon you. '

Atkins. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men
and women were obliged to enter into such compacts as

' - ' it was neither in the power of one or other to break; that

otherwise, order and justice could not be maintained,
and men would run from their wives, and abandon their
children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither '
families be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by a
legal descent. . i:

.. Crusoe. You talk like a civilian, Will. 'Could you
make her understand what you meant by inheritance and
families ? They know no such thing among the savages,
but many any how, without any regard to relation, con-
sanguinity, or family--brother and sister, nay, as I have
been told, even the father and daughter, and the son and
the mother.

' Atkins. I believe, sir, you are misinformed; my wife
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it. Per-
haps, for any further relations they may not be so exact

, as we are; but she tells me they never touch one another

in the near relations you speak of.
Omsoe. Well, what did she say t9 what you told her?
Atkins. She said she liked it very well, and it was much
better than in her country.
Crusoe. But did you tell her what marriage was ?
Atkins. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I asked
her if she would be married to me our way 9 She asked

' we, what way that was? I told her marriage was ap-

pointed of God; and here we had a strange talk together,
indeed, as ever man and wife'had, I believe.
This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife, as 1

took it down in writing just after he told it me, was as

follows :----- ,
Wife. Appointed by your God! . Why, have you a God
in your country ? *-- _ .
Atkins. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.>>

' have deformed myself, and abused his goodness, and have

Heregry Will Atkins said his heart sank within him, to
hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know
God, and he such a wicked wretch that he mild not say
one word to her about God, but what the reproach of his
own carriage would make most irrational to her to be-'
lieve; nay, that already she could not believe in God,
because he that was so ywicked was not destroyed.

Atkins. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach you
to know God, not God to know you, for he knows you
already, and every thought in your heart.

Wy'e. Why ,then, he know what I say to you now, he
know me wish to know him, how shall me know who
makes me?

Atkins. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot
teach thee; I'll pray yto him to teach thee to know him;
and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to teach thee.

that he said he fell down on his knees before her, and - ' '

you? What you hear him speak? '

~ Atkins. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has re-
' 'vealed himself many ways to us.

'Here he was at a great loss to make her understand
that God had revealed himself to us by his word, and
what his word was; but at last he told it her thus :--

Atkins. God has spoken to some good men in former
days, even from heaven, by plain words; and God has
inspired good men by his Spirit; and they have written
all his laws down in a book.

>> Wife. Me no understand that: where is book?

but, I hope I shall, one time or other, get it for you to
read it.

Here he embraced her with great afiection; but With
inexpressible grief, that he had not a Bible.

them to write that book?

what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us
perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy; and because
he forbids and commands us to avoid all that 1s wicked,
that 1s evil 1n itself, or evil 1n its consequences.

Wife. That me would understand, that me fain see;
if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked thing, he
teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked thing, he nigakee
all thing; he give allg thing; he hear me when I say 0 to
him, as you go to do just now; he makes me good if I.
wish be good, he spare me, no makes kill me when I no
be goo;d all this you say he do: yes, he be great God;
me gtake, think, behave him be great God; me say 0 to
him too with you, my dear. '

Here the poor man said he could forbear no longer;
but, raising her up, made her kneel by him, and he

pyra ed to God aloud to instruct her' 1n the knowledge of
himself by his Spirit; and that by some good providence,
if possible, she might some time or other come to have '
a Bible, that sheg might read the word of God, and be
taught by him to know him.

This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. --

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, '
too long to set down here, and particularly she made
him remiss, that, since he confessed his own life had
been wicked, abominable course of provocation against '
God, he would reform it, and not make God angry any
more, lest he should make him dead, as she called it,
and then she should be left alone, and never be taught
to know this God better; and lest he should be miser-
able, as he had told her wicked men should be after death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us
both, but particularly the young clergyman: he was in-
deed wonderfully surprised with it; but under the great-
est afiiiction im agmable that he could not talk to grher;
that he could not sp eak English, to make her understand
him, and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her. However, he turned himself to me,
and told me, that he behaved there must be more to do
with this woman than to marry her. 'I did not under-arms' wma ms'mucrnn AND BAPTISED. ' 427

stand him at first, but at length he explained himself,
. namely, that she ought to be baptised.
' I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently: "No, no; hold sir!" said he;
f'though I would have her baptised by all means, yet 1 '
must observe that Will Atldns, her husband, has indeed
brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be willing to
embrace a religious life; and has given .her just ideas of
the being of a God, of his power, justice, and mercy; yet
I desire to know of him, if he has said anything to her
of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation ofasinners ; of the
. nature of faith in him, and the redemption by him; of
_' the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and
a future state.
<<1 ' I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the
g ' poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us he
a, had said something to her of all those things, but that
fr he' was himself so wicked a creature, and his own con-
i' science so reproached him with his hOrrid, ungodly-life,
that he trembled at the apprehensions, that her know-

5. ledge of him should lessen the attention she should give
E _ to those things, and make her rather contemn religion
than receive it: but he was assured, he said, that her
i mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those

LL ' things, that, if I would but discourse with her, she would
make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would

5 not be lost upon her.
3 Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as in-
{. terpreter between the clergyman and the woman, I en-

treated him to begin with her, which he did. In a word,
he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge
of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder
and astonishment only, as she did the first notions of a
God, but with joy, and faith, and with an afi'ection and
a surprising degree of understanding scarce to be imag-
ined, much less to be expressed; and, at her own request,
she was baptised. He poured a whole dishful of water
upon the woman's head, pronouncing, in French, very loud
" Mary" SSwhich was the name her husband desired me to
give her, or I was her godfather), " I baptise thee in the

name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost;" so that none could know anything by it what
religion he was of. . -

As soon as he was over, he married them; and after
the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will Atkins,
and in a very affectionate manner, exhorted him not only
to persevere in that good disposition he was in, but to
support the convictions that were upon him, by a reso-
lution to reform his life; told him it was in vain to say
he repented, if he did not forsake his crimes; represented
to him, how God had honoured him with being the in~
strument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the
Christian religion; and that he should be careful he did
not dishonour the grace of God; and that if he did, he
would see the heathen a better Christian than himself;
the savage converted, and the instrument cast away.

He said a great many good things to them both, and
then recommended them, in a few words, to God's good-
ness; gave them the benediction again, I repeating every
thing to them in English: and thus ended the ceremony.
I think it was the most pleasant, agreeable day to me,
that ever I passed in my whole life.

But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven
savages, and fain he would have staid upon the island to
have undertaken it: but I convinced him, first, that his
undertaking was impracticable in itself; and, secondly,
that, perhaps, I could put it into a way of being done in
his absence, to his satisfaction; of which by and by.

Having thus brought the affair of the island to a nar-

' row compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship,
When the young man, whom I had taken out pf the fam-
ished ship's company, came to me, and told me, he under-
stood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused
the Englishmen to be married to the savages whom they
called wives; that he had a match too, which he desired
might be finished before I went, between two Christians,
which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his

. mother's servant, for there was no other Christian Woman ,

' on the island. 80 I began to persuade him not<to do
anything of that kind rashly, or because he found him-
self in this solitary circumstance. I represented that he

(had some considerable substance in the.world, and good
friends, as I understood by himself, and by his maid also ;

- that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was

unequal to him, she being twenty-six or twenty-seven
years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen; that
he might very probably, with my assistance, make 8.
remove from this wilderness, and come into his own
' country again, and that then it would be;a thousand to
one but he would repent his choice, and the dislike of
that circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I
was going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling;
and told me, with a. great deal of modesty, that I mistook
in my guesses; that he had nothing of that kind in his
thoughts, his present circumstances being melancholy

, and disconsolate enough, and was very glad to hear, that
I had some thoughts of putting them in a way to see
their own country again; and that nothing should have
set him upon staying there, but that the voyage I was
going was so exceedingly long and hazardous, and would
carry him out quite of the reach of all his friends: that he
had nothing to desire of me but that I would settle him
in some little property of the island where he was; give
him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he

.would "settle Muiself here like a planter, waiting the good
time when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem
him, and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when
I came to England; that he would give me some letters
to his friends in London to let them know how good I
had been to him, and what part of the world, andwhat
circumstances, I had left him in; and he promised me,
that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all
the improvements he had made upon it, let the value be
what it would, should be wholly mine. ' .- .

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering
his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he
told me positively the match was not for himself. I gave
him all possible assurances. that if I lived to come safe
to En g,land I would deliver his letters, and do his
businesgs efi'ectually, and that he might depend I would
never forget the circumstances I left him 1n. But still I
was impatient to know who was the person to be married;
upon which he told me it was my " Jack of all trades,"
and his maid Susan.

I was most agreeably surprised when he named the
match; for indeed I had thought it very suitable. The
character of that man I have given you already; and as,
for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and
religious woman; had a very geod share of sense, was

agreeable enough 1n her person; spoke very handsomely, ~

and to the purpose--always with decency and good man-
ners, and not backward to speak when anything required
it, or inipertinently forwardP to speak when it was not

her business, very handy and housewifely 1n anything

that was before her; an excellent manager, and fit, in-
deed, to have been governess to the whole island; she
knew very well how to behave herself to all kinds of folks

she had about her, and to better if she had found any

there.
' The match being proposed' in this manner, we married
them the same day , and as I was father at the altar,as
I may say, and gave her away, so I gave her a portion;
for I appointed her and 'her husband a handsome large
space of ground for their plantation; and indeed this
match, and the proposal the young gentleman made to
me, to give him a small property in the island, put me
upon parcelling it out among them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who, indeed, was now grown a most sober, grave, man-
aging fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly pious and
religious, and, as far as I may be allowed to speak posi-

tively' m such a case, I verily behave was a true sincere "

penitent.

He divided things so justly, and so much to every one 's
satisfaction, that they only desired one general writing
under my hand for the ywhole, which I caused to be drawn
up, and signed and sealed to them, setting out the bounds

and situation of every man's plantation, and testifying '
that I gave them thereby, severally, a rig ht to the whole

possession and inheritance of the respecgtive plantations
or farms with their improvements, to them and their

heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as my own pro
' perty, and a certain rent for every particular plantation

after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in my

'name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy of

the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I told

I them, I was not capable of giving them better rules than

they were able to give themselves: only made them pro-
mise me to live' 1n love and good neighbourhood with one

_ another. and so I prepared to leave them.

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves,
and having much business in hand, it was but odd to
have seven-and- thirty Indians live m a nook of the island,
independent, and indeed unemployed; for, excepting the
providing themselves food, which they had difliculty
enough' m doing sometimes, they had no manner of busi-
ness or property to manage: I prop posed therefore, to
the governor Spaniard, that he should go to them with
Fridgay' s father, and propose to them to remove, and
either yplant for themselves, or take them into their seve-
ral families as servants, to be maintained for their labour,
but without being absolute slaves; for I would not admit
them to make them slaves by force by any means, because
they had their liberty ygiven by capitulation, and, as it
were, articles of surrender, which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the prop g,osa1 and came
all very cheerfully along with him; so we allotted them
land and plantations, which three or four accepted of, .
but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the
several families we had settled; and thus my colony was
in a manner settled as follows :--The Spaniards possessed
my origin al habitation, which was the capital city, and

extended their plantation all along 'the side of the brook '
g which made the creek that I haveg so often described, as

far as my bower; and as they increased their culture, it
went always eastward. The English lived in the north- 1

east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began,
and came on southward and southwest towards the back
part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great
addition of land to take in, if they found occasion, so
that they need not jostle one another for want of room.

All the west end of the island was left uninhabited,
that if any of the savages should come on shore there,
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would
disturb them: and no doubt but they were often ashore

and went away again, for I never heard that the planters '

were attacked and disturbed any more.

CHAPTER XXVI II.

In 'nOW came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to my
friend, the clergyman, that the work of converting the
savages might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to

his satisfaction, and I told him that now I thought it was --

put in a fair way; for the savages being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every one of
them do their part with those which came under their
hands, I hoped it might have a very good effect.

This they engaged to do, and they likewise promised
us, that they would never have any differences or disputes
one with another about religion. When I came to Will
Atkins's house--I may call it so, for such a house or such
a piece of basket-work I behave was not standing in the
world again--I say, when I came thither, I found the young

woman I have mentioned above and William Atkins's wife '

were become intimates; and this prudent and religious
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had

begun ; and though it was not above four days after what I- ,

have related, yet the new baptised savage woman was

made such a Christian as I have seldom heard of any like

her in all my observation or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind in the morning, before I'A' BIBLE GIVEN T0 ATKINS. ' 433'

f Went to them, that among all the needful things I hadto;

: leave with them, I had not left a Bible, in which I showed'

, myself less considering for them than "my good friend,

the widow, was for me, when she sent me the cargo of one

. hundred pounds from Lisbon, where [she packed up three

Bibles and a Prayer-book. _ H ' l '

; However, the good woman's charity had a'greater
extent than ever she imagined, for they were reserved for 1
the comfort and instruction of those that made 'much'
better use of them than I had done. '_ '

s 'I took one of the Bibles in my pocket," and when I
came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found the
young woman and Atkins's baptised wife had been dis-
coursmg of religion together (for William 'Atkins told it
me with a great deal of joy). I asked if they Were together: .
now? and he said yes; so I, went into the house, and he ; ,
with me, and we found them together,"very earnest in'
discourse" , , , ~ .. .' , .
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any}
\ bdok among'them,' though I did not ask,'but I put my
hand in my pocket, and pulled out my Bible. "Here,"
said I to: Atkins, ~" I have brought you an assistant, that,
perhaps,'you had'not' before."; The man was so con-
founded that he was not able to speak for some time; but,
recovering himself, he takes it withboth his hands, and,
,. turning to his \wife, "Here, my dear," says he, "did not
Itell you,' our God, though he lives above, could. hear"

in such transports of passionate joy, that, between the joy' -
. of having it and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran.
down his <<face like a child that was crying. .
" ,"The woman was surprised, and was like to have run
. into a mistake that none of "us were aware of; for she,
firmly believed God had sent the book upon .her huse'
band's petition: It is, true that providentially itwas so,'\
and might be taken so in' a consequent'sensej but I be;

senger came from heaven on purpose to bring that in-
dividual book. But it was too serious a matter to suf-'.

fer any delusion to take place; so I turned to the young

woman, and told her we did not desire to impose, upon,
the new convert in her first and more ignorant under-:
standing of things, and begged her to explain to her that'
God may be very properly said to answer our petitions,
when, in the course of his providence, such things are
in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned;
for; but we do not expect returns from heaven in a mi'-;
raculous and particular manner; and that it is our mercy'
it is not so.

This the young woman did afterwards efl'eotually; so .

that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here ;'4
and I should have thought it one of the most unjustifi--
able frauds in the world to have had it so; but the sur-j
prise of joy upon Will Atkins is really not to be expres-fi
sed; and there, we may be sure, was no delusion. Sure
no man was ever more thankful in the world for any-'
thing of its kind than he was for this Bible, and I believe,
never any man was glad of a Bible from a better prin-
ciple ; and though he had been a most profligate creature,'
desperate, headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked
to a great/degree, yet this 'man is a standing rule to us'
all for the well instructing children, namely, that parents

should never give over to teach and instruct, or ever' ' '

despair of the success of their endeavours, let the chil-
dren be ever so obstinate, refractory, or to appearance
insensible of instruction ; for if ever God in his providence
touches the consciences of such, the force of their eduoa-j
tion returns upon them, and the early instruction of
parents is not lost, though it may have been many years
laid asleep, but some time or other they may find the
benefit of it. f. [

Thus it was with this poor man. However ignorant
he was, or divested of religion and Christian knowledge,
he found he had some to do with now more ignorant than
himself; and that the least part of the instruction of his'
good: father that 'could now come to his mind, was of,
use to bun

,3 Among the rest "it occurred to him, he said, how his
father used to insist much upon the inexpressible value
of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of it to nations,
families, and persons; but he never entertained the least

notion of the worth of it till now, when, being to talk to

heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help
of the written oracle for his assistance. a

The young woman was veryg glad of it also for the pre-
sent occasion, though she had one, and so had the youth,
on board our ship, among the goods which were not yet
brought on shore. And now, having said so many
things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one
storygs more of her and my self, which has something in it

ryinforming and remarkable.

weII have related to what extremity the poor young

woman was reduced, how her mistress was starved to
death, and did die on board that unhappy ship we met
at sea; and how the whole ship' s company being reduced
to the last extremity, the gentlewoman and her son, and

. this maid, were first hardly used as to provisions, and at

last totally neglected and starved--that is to say, brought
to the last extremity of hunger.'

One day ,being discoursing with her upon the extrem-
ities they ysuffered, I asked her if she could describe, by
what she y,felt what it was to starve, and how it appeared
She told me she believed she could, and she told her tale

rydistinctly, thus:--

{e " First sir," said she, "we had for some day s fared
exceedingly hard, and suffered very great hunger, but
now at last we were wholly without food of any kind, ex-
cep t sugar, and a little wine, and a little water. The
first day after I had received no food at all, I found my -
self, towards the evening, first empty and sickish at my
stomach, and nearer night mightily inclined to yawning,
and sleep; I lay down on a'couch in the great cabin to
sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little
refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down.
After being about three hours awake, it being about five
o 'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and my

stomach sickish again, and lay down again, but could

some time. .111 if;

and confused, inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing
than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and- furious with hun-

thus I held it till towards night, when, within the com-
pass of three hours, I had all these several circumstances
over again, one after another, namely, sick, sleepy, eagerly
hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then
sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again,

and so every quarter of an hour; and my strength wasted *

exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no com-
fort but in the hope that I should die before morning.

" All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was now
turned into a disease, and I had a terrible colic and grip-
~ing, wind instead of food having found its way into my

bowels; and in this condition I lay till morning, when 1
' was surprised a little with the cries and lamentations of
my young master, who called out to me that his mother
was dead. I lifted myself up a little, for I had not strength
to rise, butfound she was not dead, though she was able
to give very little signs of life.

" I had then such convulsions in my stomach for want
of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them, with
such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that nothing
but the tortures of death can imitate; and this condition
I was in when I heard the seamen above cry out, 'A sail!
a sail!' and halloo and jump about as if they were dis-
tracted.

' "I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mis-
tress much less, and my master was so sick that I thought
he had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin-
door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such
a combustion; nor had we any conversation with the
ship's company for two days, they having told us they
had not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship; and
they told us afterwards they thought we had been dead;

"It was this dreadful condition we were in when you
Were sent to save our lives; and how you found us, sir,
you know as well as I, and better too."

This was her own relation; and is such a distinct
account of starving to death as I confess I never met with,
and was exceedingly entertaining to me. I am the rather
apt to behave it to be a true account, because the youth
gave me anaccount of a good part of it; though I must

circumstances, and 1n a flourishing condition, and went

on board my ship agamthe 5th day of May, having been"
five- and-twenty days among them; and, as they were all .

resolved to stay upon the island till I came to remove
them, I promised to send some further relief from the
Brazils, if I could possibly find an opportunity; and par:
ticularly I promised to send them some cattle, such as
sheep ,,hogs and cows, for as to the two cows and calves
which I- brought fi'Om England, we. had been obliged, by

the length ofg our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of '

hay to feed them.

The next day giving them a- salute of five guns at part
ting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of A11 Saints,in 1n
the Brazils, in about twenty-two days; meeting nothing
remarkable' m our passage but this, that about three day s
after we sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting
strong to the north-nor th-east, running, as it were,

into a bay or gulf on the land- side, we were driven some- '

thing out of our course: and once or twice our men cried,
"Land to the westward, " but whether it was the con-
tinent or islands, we could not tell by any means. .

But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, cdvered
towards the land with something very black, not being
able to discover what 1t was; but after some time, our'
chief mate going up the main shrouds a little way, and
looking at them by the perspective, cried out, it was an
army ,I could not imagine what he meant by an army, and,
spokye a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some
such word "Nay,y sir," says he, " don't be angry, for it
is an army and a fleet too; for I believe there are a
thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle along,
and they" are coming towards us too, apace, and full of
men. "

I was 'a little surprised, then, indeed, and so was my
nephew, the captain; for he had heard such terrible
stories of them in the island, and having never been 1n
- those seas before," that he cOuld not tell what to think of
it, but said two or three times we should all be devoured
I must confess, considering we were becalmed'. and @e

current set strong towards the shore, I liked it the worse ;
however, I bade him not to be afraid, but bring the ship
-to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that
y we must engag ge them.
;. ~; The weather continued calm, and they came on apace
7 towards us: so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and
v; furl all our sails. As for the savages, I told them they
r had nothing to fear from them but fire; and therefore
they should3 get their beats out, and .fasten them, one
closye by thehead, and the other by the stern, and man
them both well, and wait the issue in that posture: this
I did that the men in the boats might be ready, with
' sheet and buckets, to put out any fire these savages might
endeavour to fix upon the outside of the ship.

3 In this posture we lay by for them, and m a 1)little while
' they came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians. My mate was much mistaken in his
calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand canoes ,
the most we could make of them, When they came up,
being about one hundred and twenty-six--and a great
many of them too:. for some of them had sixteen or
seventeen men in them, some more, and the least six or
seven #5 PS7157 C #1;

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck
with wondery and astonisMent, as at a sight which they--
. had, doubtless, never seen before, nor could they ,at first,{~
' as we afterwards understood, know what to make of us. +
They cameboldly up,however, very near tous, and seemed
, to go about to row round us; but we called to our men:
in the- boats, not to let they come too near them;- , '

. :tThis- very order brought us to an engagement with
them without our designing it; for five or six of their
large canoes came so near our long boat, that our .men
' beckoned with their hands to themg to keep back, which,
' they understood very well, and went back, 'but at their:-
retreat about five hundred arrows came on board us from
those boats, and one of our men in the long-boat was very
' much wounded, p. ,. -.;- ,,,,,

the carpenter presently set-up a kind of a fence, like waist, ,
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages'
if they should shoot again. a '
About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a
body astern of us, and pretty near--so near that we could _,;
. easily discern what they were, though we could not tell -
their design. I easily found they were some of my old
friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to'
engage with; and in a little time more they rowed some-
what farther out to sea, till they came directly broadside
with us, and then rowed down straight upon us, till they
came so near that they could hear us speak. Upon this, ~_
I ordered allmy men to keep close, lest they should shoot "i '
any more arrows, and make all our guns ready; but being :5
so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out
upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his language,
to know what they meant, which accordingly he did: '
whether they understood him or not, that I know not;
but, as soon as he called to them, six of them, who were,
in the foremost, or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes
from us, and, stooping down, put themselves in a very
indwent posture. Whether this was a defiance, or chal-
lenge, we knew not: or whether it was done- in - mere
contempt, 'or a signal to the rest ; but immediately Friday
cried out, they were going to shoot ;* and, unhappily for
-him (poor fellow!) they let fly about three hundred of
their arrows, and, to my inexpressi'ole grief, killed poor.

fired; and our gunners took their aim so well, that three;

Their ill manners gave us no great offence; neither did
I know for certain whether that, which would pass for
the greatest contempt among us, might be understood
so by them or not; therefore, in return, I had only re-
solved to have fired four or five guns with powder only,
which I knew would fright them sufficiently, but when
they shot at us directlyg with all the fin'y they were cap-
able of, and especially as they had killedmy poor Friday,
whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed,
so well deserved it, I not only had been justified before
God and man, but would have been very glad, if I could,
to have overset every canoe there, and drowned every one

_of them.

'I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many
we wounded at this broadside; but sure such a fright
and hurry never was seen among such a multitude ; there
were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and over-
set in all, and the men all set a-swimming ;the rest,
frig hted out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they
could, taking but little care, to save those whose boats
were split or spoiled with our shot: so I suppose that
they were many of them lost; and our men took up one
poor fellow swimming for his life, above an hour after
they were all gone.

Our small shot hem our cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many ,,but in short, we never knew any-
thing how it went with them; for they fled so fast, that,
inthree hours or thereabouts, we could not see above three
or four straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest"
any more; for a. breeze of wind springm g up the same
evening, we weighed, and set sail for the Brazils.

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so
sullen that he would neither eat nor speak; and we all
fancied he would starve himself to death: but I took a
way to cure' him; for I made them take him, and turn,
him into the long-boat, and make him believe they would .
toss him into the sea again, and so leave him where they
found him, if he would not speak; nor would that do,
but they really did throw him into the sea, and came
away from him; and then he followed them, for he swam

like a cork, and called to them m his tongue, though they
knew not one word of what he said. However, at last,
they took him' m again, and then he beg an to be more
tractable; nor did I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; ybut I was the most
disconsolate creature alive forg want of my man Friday y,
and would have been very glad to have gone back to the
island, to have taken one of the rest from thence for my
occasion; but it could not be, so we went on. We had
one prisoner, as I haVe said, and it was a long while be-
fore we could make him understand anything; but in
time our men taught him some English, and he beg an to
be a little tractable; afterwards we inquired whatg coun-

try he came from, but could make nothing of what he .

said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoken
in the throat' m such a hollow andgu odd manner, that we
could never form a word from him, and we we1e all of
opinion that the might speak that language as well if
they Were gagged}: as otherwise; nor could we perceive

that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, ,

or palate, but formed their words just as almnting -horn.'

some time after, when we had taught him to speak a
little English, that they were going with their kings to-
fight a great battle. When he said kings, we askedghim,
how many kings? He said," there were five nation"
(we could not make him understand the plural s), and.
, that they all joined to go against two nation. We asked

him," What made them come up to us ?" He said," To'

that all those natives, as also those of Africa, when they
learn English, they also add two e's at the end of the
words where we use one, and place the accent upon the
last of them--as makes, takes, and the like, and we could
not break them of it; nay ,I,could hardly make Friday
leave it ofl', though at last he did.

as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to send

the refreshments I intended to my plantation.

 

 

CHAPTER XXIX. ,

Aoooanmeu he got hands, and finished the sloop in a
very few days, for she was already framed; and I gave. '
the master of her such instructions as.he could not miss '
the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an account from,
Jny partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with.
the smallcargo I had sent them; and one of our sea-f
men, that had been on shore with me there, offered to:

go with the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to the, ' '
governor Spaniard, to allot him a suflicient quantity of
land for a plantation, and giving him some clothes, and
tools for his planting work, which he said he understood,
having been an old planter in Maryland, and a buccaneer
into the bargain. ' . '

I encouraged the fellow, by granting all he desired;
and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we
had taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered
the governor Spaniard to give him his share of every-
thing he wanted, with the rest. ' ..

When we come to fit this man out, my old partner
told me,_there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil
planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the dis-
pleasure of the' church. "I know not what the matter
is with him," says he, "but, on my conscience, I think
he is a heretic in his heart; and he has been obliged to
conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition; that he would
be very glad .of such an opportunity to make his escape,
with his wife and two daughters; and if I would let them, i .
go to the island, and allot them a plantation, he would i

, g the Inquisition had-seized all his efiects and estate, and
~ '- he had nothing left but a little household stufi', and two
" -' .37 slaves; and," adds he, "though I hate his principles, yet
, , I would not have him fall into their hands, for he will
' c assuredly be burnt alive if he does." -
, I granted this presently, and joined my Englishm
with them; and we concealedthe man, and his wife and
daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go
, to sea; and then (having put all their goods on board the
' sloop some time before), we put them on board" the sloop,
after she was got out of the bay. ,
- e; ,Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new part-
- 'ner ; and their stock, indeed, was much alike rich in tools
and in preparations for a farm; but nothing to, begin
with,lbut as above. However, they canied over with them
(which was worth all the rest? some materials for plant-
' ing sugar-canes, with some p ants of canes, which he (I
mean the Portugal man) understood very well. V
- . '9 Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in the
island, I sent them, by this sloop, three milch cows and
five calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three
sows big with pig, and two mares and a horse. '
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged
three Portugal women to go; and recommended it to
them to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have
i procured more women, but I remembered that the poor
ersecuted man had two daughters, and that there were .
ut five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest had wives
g of their own,' though in another country; , _ ~ , . ,'

have done well enough; but as I rambled from them and '
came thither no more, the last letters I had from any of '
them were by my partner's means, who afterwards sent
another sloop to the place ; and who sent me word, though
I had not the letter till five years after it was written,
that they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their
long stay there--that Will Atkins was dead--sthat five
of the Spaniards were come away--and that though they
had not been much molested by the savages, yet they had-
had some skirmishes with them--that they begged of him
to write to me to think of. the promiseI had made to fetch
them away, that they might see their own country again _
before they. died. ' '
I: But I was gone a wild-goose chase, indeed;- and they
who will have any more of me, must be content to fol-
low me through a new variety of.follies, hardships, and
wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may
be duly observed, and we may see how easily Heaven can
gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of our
wishes to be our afiiiction, and punish us most severely
with those very things which we think it would be our ut-

ticular station of life for himself. Man is a short-sighted-

his passions are none of hisbest friends, so his particu-,
lar affections are generally his worst counsellors.

from a youth, to wander into the world, and how evident
it now was that this principle was preserved in me for

' But it was too late now--all things Heaven appoints

things to be thankful for, and you had never heard of the
second part of the Travels and Adventures of Robinson

Crusoe; so I must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at ~ 1

myself, and go on with my voyage.

' From the Brazils, we made directly away over, the
Atlantic Sea to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, as we
call it, the Cape of Good Hope, and had a tolerable good
voyage, our course generally south-east; now and then
a storm, and some contrary winds. But my disasters at
sea were at an end--my future rubs and cross events
were to befall me on shore--that it might appear the
land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea,

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a super- 1 '

cargo on board, who was to direct all her motions after
she arrived at the Cape ;' only being limited to a certain
number of days for stay, by charter-party, at the several
ports she was to go to. This was none of my business,
neither did I meddle with it at all; my nephew, the cap-
tain, and the supercargo, adjusting all those things be-
tween them as they thought fit.

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was needful
to take in' fresh water, but made the best of our way for

the coast of Coromandel : we were, indeed, informed that *

a French man-of-war of fifty guns, and two large mer-
chant ships, were gone for the Indies; and as I knew

fist I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with de-
' scriptions of places, journals of our voyages, variations
'. of the com ass, latitudes, meridian distances, trade~winds, --
situation of ports, and the like--such as almost all the,
' histories of long navigation are full of, and which make
the reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly unprofit-
able to all that read, except only to those who are to go to
those places themselves.

It is enough to name the ports and places which we
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passing
from one to another. We touched first at the island of
Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and
treacherous, and, in particular, very well armed with
lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable dex-
terity, yet we fared very well with them a while; they '
treated us very civilly, and for some trifles which we gave
them, such as knives, scissors, &c. ,they brought us eleven

good fat bullocks, middling in size, but very good' in flesh,
_ which we took in, partly fgor fresh provisions for our pre-
sent spending, andp the rest to salt.

We were obliged to stay here for some time after we
.had furnished ourselves with provisions, and I, that was
always too curious to look into every nook of the world
wherever I came, was for going on shore as often as I
could. It'was on the "east side of the island that we
went on shore one evening, and the people, who, by the ,
way, are very numerous, came thronging about us, and
stood gazing at us at a distance. As we had traded '
freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no dang er; but when we saw the people,g we
cut three boughs out of a tree and stuck them up at a dis-
tance from us, which, it seems, is a mark in the country
not only of truce and friendship, but, when it' is accepted,
the other side set up three poles or boughs also, which

is a signal that they accept the truce too; but then this _ ~

is a known condition of the truce, that you are not to pass
beyond their three poles towards them, nor they come
, past your three poles or boughs towards you; so that you
are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all the
space between your poles and theirs is allowed, like a _
market, for free converse, trafiic, and commerce. When' 7
~ you go thither, you must not carryy our weapons with
.you; and if they come into that space, ythey stick up their
javelins and lances all at the first poles, and come on un-
armed; but, if any violence is offered them, and the truce
thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold
of their weapons, and then the truce 18 at an end.
It happened one evening when we went on shore, that
a greater number of their people came down than usual,
but all was very friendlyap (1 civil. They brought with , ,
them several kinds of provisions, for which we satisfied i

us, and allwas quiet; and we made us a little tent, or hut, "
of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all that night. _
' I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so "'
well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat lying
at an anchor about a stone's cast from the land, with two
men in her to take care of her, I made one of them come
on shore, and, getting some boughs of trees to cover us .
also 1n the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the
boat, and lay on board, under the cover of the branches
of the trees, yall night.

About two o 'clock' In the morning, we heard one of our.
men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out for
God's sake to bring the boat 1n, and come and help them,
for they were all like to be murdered, at the same time
I heard the firing of five muskets, which was the number
of the guns they had, and that three times over;' for it
seems, the natives here were not so easily frighted with
guns as the savages were in America, where I had to do
with them.

All this while I knew not what was the matter; but'
rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused
the boat to be thrust 1n, and resolved, with three fusils
we had on board, to land and assist our men.

We got the boat soon to the shore; but our men were
in too much haste; for, being came to the shore, theyonsmrun'ocounsanoas AT MADAGASCAR. , '453 1

pedition they could, being pursued by between three and
_ four hundred men, Our men were but nine in all, and
7. only five had fusils; the rest, indeed, had pistols, and
.7 swords, but they were of small use to them. '
~ We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
" enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and
L'that which was still worse was, that while we stood in.
the boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger
: as they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows in
_' upon us so thick, that we were fain to barricade the side
of the boat .up with the benches and two or three loose
' v boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by mere
"accident, or providence rather, in the boat.
3-:5 'And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such
"exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least '
part of any of us, they would have been sure of us. We
had, bythe light of the moon, 8. little sight of them as
they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows;
. and having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them avolley,
.and we could hear by the cries of some of them, that we
had wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle
.array on the shore till break of day, which we suppose
was that they might see the better to take their aim at us.
*7? " In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh
'_ our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs
stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as
1' we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot.
.r We made signals of distress to the ship, which, though
she rode a league off, yet'my nephew, the captain, hear-
2: ing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we
{ lay in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty well
understood us; and weighing anchor with all speed, he
"stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and
then sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us;
1 but we called to them not to come too near, telling them
_. what condition we were in. However, they stood in nearer

them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, '
and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a ter-
rible'havoc among them. .
., _When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had
' time to examine into the occasion of this hay; and indeed
our su'percargo, who had been often in those parts, put-
me upon it ; for he said he was sure the inhabitants would
' not have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had
not done something to provoke them to it. At length it '
came out, namely, that an old woman, who had come to
sell us some milk, had brought it within our poles, with
' ~ a young woman with her, who also brought some roots
0r herbs; and while the old woman (whether she was-
mother to the young woman or no they could not tell)
was selling us the milk, one of our men ofi'eredsome rude-
ness to the girl that was with her, at which theold woman
' made a great noise. Hewever, the seaman would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight
among the trees, it being almost dark: The old woman
went away without her, and, as we suppose, made an out-
cry among the people she came from; who, upon notice,
raised this great army upon us in three or four hours;
and it was great odds but we had been all destroyed." -
_ ' One of our men was killed with a lance that was thrown ' '
at him, just at the beginning of the attack, ashe sallied
out of the tent we had made; the rest came off free, all
but the fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief,
who paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we could
not hear what became of him a great while. We lay upon
the shore two days after, though the wind presented, and
made signals for him; made our boat sail up shore and

had been the less. .. - ' '-:

. ,on shore once more, to try if I could learn anything of him
'or them. \ It was 'the third night after the action, thatI
had a great mind to learn, if I could by any means, what
mischief we had done, and how the game stood on the
' Indian 'side. I was careful to do it in the dark, lest we
. should be attacked again; but I ought indeed to have
, been sure that the men I went with had been under my
command, befOre I engaged in a thing so hazardous and
. mischievous, as I was brought into it without my know-
' ' ledge or desire. . K .

ship besides the supercargo, and myself; and we landed,

into two companies, whereof the bdatswain commanded
one, and I the other. We neither could hear nor see,

; When'we had made, as I thought, a full discovery 0
all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for going
on board again: but the boatswain and his party often
sent me word, that they were resolved to make a visit to
the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them,

- dwelt, and desired me to go along with them, and if they ,
could find them, as they still fancied they should, they'~'
did not doubt, they said, getting a good booty, and it ,
might be they might find Thomas J efirys there--that was i
the man's name we had lost. - -

'Had they sent to ask my leave to go,- I knew well :
enough what answer to have given them; for I would "
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it

, was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship and a
ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to make, which
depended very much upon the lives of the men; but as 7';
they sent me word they were resolved to go, and'only _
asked me and my company to go along with them, 1,,
positively refused it, and rose up (for I was sitting on the 1;
ground) in order to go to the boat. One or two of the :;
men began to importune me to go, and when I still re-

. fused positively, began to grumble and say they were not '
under my command, and they would go. ".Come, J ack," ..
says one of the men, "will you go with me? I will go
for one." Jack said he would; and another followed, '
and then- another; and, in a word; they all left me but .
one, whom, with much difiiculty too, I persuaded to -
stay; so the supercargo and I, with one man, went back ~
to the boat, where, I told them, we would stay for them,
and take care to take in as many of them as should be
left; for I told them it was a mad thing they were going
about, and supposed most of them would run the fate of 5
Thomas Jeflrys. ' , '->

They told me; like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care, &c. So
away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship
and the voyage: that their lives were not their own, and -
that they were entrusted with the voyagein some measure ;
that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want
of their help, and that they could not answer it to God ,. 3m nxpamrron IN THE NIGHT, _ i' i 79715771

3 and man. : I said a great deal more to them on that head, 4
, at I might as well have talked to the main-mast of the
'- ship; they were mad upon their journey; only they gave
1' me good words, and begged I would not be angry; said
8 they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but
' they would be back again in about an hour at furthest:
:r for the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile -

s off, though they found it about two miles before they got
i to it. ' - '

37w. Well, they all went away as above; and though the

., attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen '

-' would have gone about, yet, to give them their due, they

2 went about it warily as well as boldly. ' They were gal-

. lantly armed, that is true ; for they had every man a fusil,

a or musket, a bayonet, and every man a pistol; some of

-' them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers, and the

.' boatswain and two more had pole-axes ; besides all which, '
, they had among.them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder

' fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked '

*work in the world.

sWhen they went out, their chief design was plunder,

= and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there;

3' but a circumstance; which none of them were aware of,

7' set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them

1' all.- When they came to the few Indian houses, which

-- they thought had been the town, which were not above

; half a mile of,.they were under-a great disappointment;

. for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses: and

: where the town was, or how big, they knew not. They

r'consulted, therefore, what to do, and were some time be-

: fore they could resolve; ,for, if they fell upon these, they
must cut all their throats, and it was ten to one but some

. of them might escape, it being in the night, though the

3 moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run 'away,

_' and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army

upon them. Again, on the other hand, if they went away,

and left those untouched (for the people were all asleep),

they could not tell which way to look for the town.

"a However, the last was the best advice; so they resolved

0 leave those houses, and look for the town as well as

a
they could") ,They went on a little way, "and fdund a cow >> 5
tied 130 a tree; this they concluded would be a good guide -'

to them; for they said the cow certainly belonged to the
town before them, or the town behind them, and if they
untied her, they should see which way'she went: if she.
went back, they had nothing td say to her, but if she went
forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her; so
they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and
the cow went on before them. In a word, the cow led
them directly to the town, which, as they reported, 'con-
' sisted of above two hundred houses, or huts; and in some
of these they found several families living together.
~ Here they found all silent; as profoundly secure as-
sleep and a country that had never seen an enemyof that
kind could make them. Upon this, they called another
council to consider what they had to do, and in a word
they resolved to divide themselves into three bodies, and
to set three houses on fire in three parts of the town,
and as the men came out, to seize them and bind them;
if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do then,
and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder; but
resolved to march silently first through the .town,'and
see what dimensions it was of, and considerif they might
venture upon it "or no. " . .
,i . They did so, and desperately resolved that they would
venture upon them} but while they were animating one
another to the work, three of them that were a little
- . before the rest called out aloud,'and told them-they had
found Thomas Jeffrys; they all ran up to the place, and
so it was indeed, for there they found the poor fellow
hanged up naked _by one arm, and his throat out. There
was an Indian house just by the tree, where they found
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had
beenconcerned in the fray with us before, and two or
- three of them wounded with our shot; and our men found
they were awake, and talking one to another in that house,
but knew not their number.
The eight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged
them, as before, that the swore to one another they
would be revenged, and at not an Indian who came

into their hands should have quarter ;, and to work they
went immediately, and yet not so madly as by the rage>>
and furythey werepin might be expected; ' Their first
' {care was to get something that would soon take fire; but
, ,afteralittle search theyfound that would be to no purpose,
for most of the houses were low, and thatched with flags
tor rushes, of which the country is full; so they presently
jmade somewild-fire, as we call it, by wetting a little o
powder in the palms of their hands; and in a quarter of
an hour they set the town on fire in four or five places,
i. and particularly that house where the Indians were not "
gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze, the
poor fiighted creatures began to rush out to save their .
lives, but met with their fate in the attempt, and espe-
cially at the door, where theypdrove them back, the boat-
sivain himself killing one or two with his pole-axe: the
house being large, and many in it, he did not care to go
,in,' but called for a hand-grenade, and threw it among
. Lthem, which at first frighted them; but when it burst,
.vmadesuch havoc among them, that they cried out in, a
hideous manner. ' -
. 3. gln short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part .of the house, were killed or hurt with the grenado,
except two or three more, who pressed to the door, which
"the boatswain and two more kept with the bayonets in
the muzzles of their pieces, and despatched all who came .
that way. But there was another apartment in the house,
where the prince, or king, or whatsoever he was, and \ '
several others, were; and they kept in till the house, .
which was by this time all of a light fiame,-_fell in upon ' '.
them,- and they were smothered or burnt together.i ; "
:2? All this while they fired not a gun, because they would
not waken the people faster than tlfey could master them ; '
but the fire began to waken them fast enough, and our
fellows were glad to keeps. little together in bodies; _for'
' the fire grew so raging, all the houses being made of
light combustible stufi, that they could hardly bear the
' street, between; them, and their business was to follow
; the fire for the surer execution. As fast as the fire either .
' forcedthe people out of those houses which were burning, .. /

orfrighted them out of others, our people were ready at
their doors to knock them on the head, still calling and
hallooing to one another to remember Thomas J effrys '

While this was doing, I must confess Iwas very uneasy,

and especially when I saw the flames of the town, which,

it being night, seemed to be just by me.

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men, :4.
too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing 1"
what the matter was, or what danger I was in; especially 1'5?
hearing the guns too, for by this time they began to use
their the -arms. A thousand thoughts oppressed his mind
concerning me and the sup percargo, what should become-

of us; and at last, though he could ill spare any more _-,
men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might be in, he

takes another boat, and with thirteen men and himself, 4:
comes on shore to me. -
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the

boat with no more than two men, for one had been left 32

to keep the boat; and though he was glad that we were . 1'
well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know
what was doing, for the noise continued, and the flame
increased. I confess it was next to an impossibility for
any men in the world to restrain their curiosity of know- .
ing what had happened, or their concern for the safety
of the men. In a word, the captain told me he would go
and help his men, let what would come. I argued with
him, as I did before with the men, the safety of the ship,
and the danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners
and merchants, &c., and told him I would go, and the two
~men, and only see if we could, at a distance, learn what
was like to be the event, and come back and tell him.
, It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk
to the rest before; he would go, he said, and he only
wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for ,he could '
not think of having his men lost for want of help he had
rather, he said, lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and
all, and so away 'went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now than I ,
was to persuade them not to go before, so, in short, the
' captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, and '"A DREADFUL SCENE;

fetch twelve men more from the ship, leaving the long-o _ . '
boat at an anchor; and that when they came back, six
~ men should keep the two boats, and six mere come after '
us, so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof
2 two were lost in the first quarrel which brought this mis-
chief on. _

L: Being now on the march,.you may be sure we felt.
little of the ground we trod on; and being guided by the
fire, we kept no' path, but went directly to the place of
; the flame. If the noise of the guns was surprising tolus
: before, the cries of the poor people were now quite of an-
' other nature, and filled us with horror. I must confess
never was at the sacking of a city, or at the taking of
" a town by storm; I have heard of, Oliver Cromwell tak-
, mg Drogheda in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and
'- child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the city of
:; Magdebourg, and cutting the throats of twenty-two thou-
' sand of both sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing
tself before, nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror
3 which was upon" our minds at hearing it. '

'v However, we went on, and at length came to the town,
j though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire.

_ 5, The first object that we met with was the ruins of a
' hut, or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house was
, onsumed; and just before it, plain now to be. seen by'
_Q the light of the fire, lay four men and three women killed;

' and, as; we thought, one or two more lay inthe heap
-5 among the fire. In short, these were such instances of '
rage ' altogether barbarous, and of a fury something
'2 beyond what was human,>that we thought it impossible
} Our men could be guilty of it; or, if they were the authors
I. of it, we thought that every one of them ought to be put

< to the worst of deaths. But this was not all; we saw the

i fire increased forward, and the cry went on just as the
' fire went on, so that we were in the utmost confusion>>

butchers (for I can call them no better in the rear, who
when they could overtake them, fire in among them,
and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our"
sig ht: when the rest saw us, behaving us to be their ene
mics, and that we would murder them as well as those
that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek
especially the women, and two of them fell down, as if al
ready dead, with the flight. '

My very soul shrank within me, and my blood ran 1;
chill in my veins, when I saw this; and I believe had "2'
the three En glish's sailors that pursued them come on, I gt}: a
had made our men kill them all. However, we took some ': j
' ways to let the poor flying creatures know that we would '5
not yhurt them, and immediately they came up to us, and ,1 3'
kneeling down, with their hands lifted up m,ade piteous '
lamentations to us to save them, which we let them know -
we would do , whereupon they kept all together in a .fi
huddle close behind us for protection. I left my men
drawn up together, and charged them to hurt nobody,- _
but if possible to get at some of our people, and see what 3
devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to
do; and, in a word, to command them off, assuring them 'v
that if they staid till day-light they would have a hundred ,' ,, .
thousand men about their ears--yI say ,I left them, and it;
went among those flying people, taking only two of our . '
men with me; and there was indeed a piteous spectacle 2
among them: some of them had their feet terribly burnt ' "
with trampling and running through the fire, others their
hands burnt, one of the women had fallen down' in the. ~
fire, and was almost burnt to death before she could get
out again; two or three of the men had cuts in their
backs and thighs from our men pursuing, and another-
was shot through the body and died while I was there.

I would faing have learnt what the occasion of all this
was, butIeould notunderstand onewordthey said, though
by signs I perceived that some of them knew not what
' was the occasion themselves. . I was so terrified 1n my
thoughts -at this outrageous attempt, that I "could not
stay there, but went back to my own men: I told them.. my resolution, and commanded them to follow me ; when;
' in the very moment, came four of our men, with the
boatswain'at their head, running over the heaps of bodies
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if
they wanted more people to massacre, when our men
challooed to them as loud as they could halloo, and with
1': much ado one of them made them hear, so that they knew
: who we were, and came up to us. " '- >> '
iAs "soon-as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo,
- like 'a 'shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more

But I had now a new task upon my hands; for when the '
had with the others ; nay, my. nephew himself fell in with j
them, and told me, in their hearing, that he was only con ,7
. cerned for fear of the men being overpowered; for as to ,
the people, he thought not one of them ought to live ; for .
they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the '
poor man, and that they ought to be used like murderers
Upon these words away ran eight of my men with the .
boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work '
and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them,
came away pensive and, sad, for I could not bear the .
sight, much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor "
wretches that fell into their hands. .
I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo
and two men, and with these I walked back to the boats. '
It was a very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to '
venture back as it were alone: for as it began now to be ;
almost day, and the alarm had run over the country,
there stood about forty men, armed with lances and bows,
at a little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood,
mentioned before, but by accident I missed the place, and
came directly to the sea-side; and by the time I got to
* the sea-side it was broad day: immediately I took the pin-
nace and went abroad, and sent her back to assist the men
V in what might happen. . r.
- I observed, that about the time I came to the boat-side,
the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but
in about half an hour after I got on board, I heard a vol-
_ley of our men's fire-arms, and saw a great smoke; this,
as I understood afterwards, was our men falling upOn the

By the time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace, our men began to appear; they came dropping 7: 1'
in- some and some, not in two bodies, and in form, as they
went out, but all in heaps, straggling here and there in
such a manner that a small force of resolute men might
have cut them all off. - . ' '-

The people were amazed and surprised, and so fri ghted,
that I believe a hundred of them would have fled gat the a
sight of but five of our men. Nor 1n all this terrible

' fence; they were so surprised between the tenor of the

e. I was very ryangry with my nephew, the captain, and
indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with him 1n
particular, as well for his acting so out of his duty, as
, commander of the ship, and having the charge of the
" voyage upon him, as in his promoting rather than cool-1
mg the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel an enter-
. My nephew answered me very respectfully, but,
' told6 me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman
whom they had murdered 1n such a cruel and barbarous
manner,'he was not master of himself, neither could he
.1 govern his passion: he owned he should not have done
' so, as he was commander of the ship p; but as he was a
man, and nature moved him, he_ could not bear it. As;
for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me at.
all, and they knew it well enough, so thatJ they took no

ording to the best of their accounts, put all together, they
killed and destroyed about a hundred and fifty people,
men, women, and children, and left not a house standing

was as true that Jetfrys was the aggressor, had broken

of theirs, who came to our camp innocently, and on the '
faith of their oapitulation. A s '

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were af-' '
terwards on board. He said it was true that we seemed
to break the truce, but really had not, and that the war '
was begun the night before by the natives themselves, who 5'
had shot at us, and killed one of our men without any '
just provocation: so that as we were in a capacity to. 1,
fight them, we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves "
justice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that, -_
though the poor man had taken liberty with a girl, he '1'
' ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a vil-z .:

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from .?_
-- thence to the coast of Goromandel, only to touch at Surat; "
but the chief of the supercargo's design lay at the Bay 0
Bengal, where, if he missed of the business outward bound>> 2;
he was to go up to China, and return to the coast as he: '
came home. ' ,"'*:!ifv"'
The first disaster that befall us was in the Gulf of
Persia, where five of our men, venturing on shore on the. '1
Arabian side of the Gulf, were surrounded by the Arabsp,
and either all killed or carried away into slavery :'1 the rest
of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them, and had i
but just time to get ofl' their boat. I began to upbraidthem with the just retribution of Heaven in this case:
. but the boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I
went further in my censures than I could show any war;
7; rent for in Scripture, and referred to the thirteenth of St
'3 Duke, verse 4th, where our Saviour intimates, that those
men on whom the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners
; above all the Galileans: but that which indeed put me to
', silence in this case, was that none of these five men who

: shore to the massacre of Madagascar (so I always called
if it, though our men could not bear the word "massacre "
with any patience); and, indeed, this last circumstance,
>>' as I have said, put me to silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had
. worse consequences that I expected; and the boatswain,
r who had been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to
"me one time, and told me he found that I continually
} brought this affair upon the stage--that I made unjust
; reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on that
: account, and himself in particular--that as I was but a
' passenger, and had no command in the ship, or concern
'1 in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it--that they
: did not know but I might have some ill design in my head, _-
and perhaps call them to an account for it when they
' ' came to England--and that therefore, unless I would res
., solve to have done with it, and also not to concern myself
; farther with him, or any of his afiairs, he would leave
I, the ship, for he did not think it was safe to sail with me
mong them. ' '
r' I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then
j told him, that I did confess I had allalong opposed the
. massacre, of Madagascar, for such I would always call it;
1 and that I had on all occasions spoken my mind freely
about it, though not more upon him than any of the rest;
' that as to my having not command in the ship, that was
true, nor did I exercise any authority, only took the
. liberty of speaking my mind in things which publicly con-
cerned us all: as to whet concern I had in the voyage,
1 that was none of his business ; I was a considerable owner
; of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right
to speak, even further than I had yet done, and would 1
not be accountable to him or any one else; and began _to 7}
. be a little warm with him: he made but little reply to
me at that time, and I thought that affair had been over.,.
We were at this time in the road to Bengal: and being >>
willing to see the place, I went on shore with the super-
cargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and towards
evening was preparing to go on board, when One of the
men came to me, and told me he would not have me
. trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they had
' orders not to carry me on board. Any one may guess
what a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and T

I asked the man who bade him deliver that errand to me ? .

He told me the coxswain. I said no more to the fellow,-

but bade him let them know he had delivered his message,

and that I had given him no answer to it.

_ I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and '
. told him the story, adding, what I presently foresaw,
namely, that there would certainly be a mutiny in the '
ship; and entreated him to go immediately on board the
ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of it
but I might have spared this intelligence, for before I had

_ spoken to him on shore, the matter was effected on board:
the boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and,in a word,
all the inferior ofl'icers, as soon as I was gone off in the
boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak
with the captain; and there the boatswain, making a'
long harangue (for the fellow talked very well), and repeat-
ing all he had said to me, told the captain in a few words >>
that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were -.
loath to use any violence with me; which, if I had not j
gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige -
me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to tell j
him, that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship,
under his command, they would perform it faithfully; '
but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige ',-
me toquit it, they would, all leave the ship, and sail no .j
farther with him; and at that W0rd_ALL, he turned his
face about towards the main-mast, which was, it seems, the ;
signal agreed on between them, at which all the seamen T,>> a THREATENED norm 1N rnn SHIP. . . 469 ,

being brought together, they cried out, " One and ALL!
One and ALL ! "

{a My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of
great presence of mind; and though he was surprised,y ou
, maybe sure, at the thing g, yet he told them calmly yhe
"would consider of the matter, but that he could do nothing
in it till he had spoken to me about it: he used some
- - arguments with them, to show them the unreasonableness
" and m] ustice of the thing, but it was all m vain, they
swore, Jand shook hands round before his face, that they
would go all on shore, unless he would engage to them
not to sgufier me to come on board the ship.

r This was a hard article up on him, who knew his ob-
_ ligation to me,_and did not know how I might take it; so
Lhe began to talk cavalierly to them--told them that I was
a very considerable owner of the ship, and that, in justice,
. he could not put me out of my own house--that this was
' next door to serving me as the famous pirate Kid had
done, who made the mutiny 1n the ship, set the captain
on shore on an uninhabited island, and ran away with
the ship-- -that let them go into what ship they would, if
ever they came to En gland again, it would cost them
dear--that the ship was mine, and that he would not put
1' me- out of it--and that he would rather lose the ship, and
the voyage too, than disoblige me so much ; so they might
do as they pleased. However, he would go on shore, and
, talk with me there, and invited the boatswain to go with
hm;l and, perhaps, they might accommodate the matter
Wit me.

:3>> But they all rejected the proposal, and said they would
have nothing to do with me any more, neither on board
nor on shoreg; and, if I came on board, they would go on
:4 shore. "Well," said the captain, "if you are all of this
mind, let me go on shore and talk with him: " so away _
he came to me with this account, a little after the message _
had been brought to me from the coxswain.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for
I was not without apprehensions that they would con-
fine him by violence, set sail, and run away with the ship ,
and then I had been stripped naked, in a remote country,V; '3'. ;T,.,t.,.7vu,<<_n.l, '"T' "7.7,

and nothing to help myself: in short, I had been in a '
worse case than when I was all alone on the island.;::i .
2;. But they had not come to that length, it seems, to my -
great satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what '
they had said to him, and how they had sworn, and shook
hands, that they would one and all leave the ship, if I
was suffered to come on board, I told him he should not
be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore; 1,
only desired he would take care and send me all my '
necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum
of money, and I would find my way to England as well
as I could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but
there was no way to help it, but to com ply with it. So,
in short, he went on board the ship again, agamand satisfied V
the men that his uncle had yielded to their importunity,
and had sent for his goods from on board the ship. 80
the matter was over in a very few hours, the men re-
turned to their duty, and I began to consider what course
I should steer.

I was now alone, in the remotest part at the world, as
I think I may call it, for I was near three thousand
leagues by sea, farther ofi' from Eng land than I was at
my island, only, it 15 true, I might gravel here by land,
over the Great Mogul' 3 country to Surat; might gofi-om
thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and from
thence might take the way of the caravans, over the
deserts of Arabia to Alep ppo and Seanderoon, and from :<<
thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland into France;
and this,p ut together, might be, at least, a full diameter
of the globe; but, if it were to be measured, I suppose it
would ap ppear to be a great deal more.

-I had another way before me, which was to wait for
some English ships, which were coming to Bengal from
Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get passage on
board them for En gland: but as I came ghither without
any concern with the English East India Company, so it
would be difficult to go from hence without their licence,
unless with great favour of the captains of the ships, or of
theCompany' sfactors; andtobothIwas anutter stranger.>>wrsoposaa raon AN ENGLISH muncmr.' ' c .471>> 7

' Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by con-
trarieties, to see the ship set sail without Ime--a treat-
ment, I think, a man in my circumstances Scarce ever
met with, except from pirates running-away with the ship,
and setting those that would not agree with their villany
on shore : indeed,- this was the next door to it both ways.
However, my nephew left me two servants, or rather, one
" . companion and one servant: the first was clerk to the
purser, whom he engaged to go with me ; and the other
was his own servant. I took me also a good lodging in
the houSe of an Englishwoman, where several merchants
lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and
one Englishman. Here'I was handsomely enough enter-
tained ; and that Imight not be said to run rashly upon
anything, I staid here above nine months, considering
what course to take, and how to manage myself.- I had
- : some English goods with me of value, and a considerable

' :7; sum of money; my nephew furnishing me with a thou

' sand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I

' '7 had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever
might happen.

at; I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage top; .
and, as I. originally intended, I bought here some very
good diamonds, which, of all other things, were the most
proper for me, in my circumstances, because I might al-
ways carr'y my whole estate about me. . .
1.. After a long stay here, and many proposals made for
my return to England, but none falling to-my mind, the
English merchant, who lodged with me, and with whom
I had contracted an intimate acquaintance, came to me
one morning. " Countryman," says he, "I have a prOa
ject to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my
thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours also,
when you shall have thoroughly considered it. _
9.3;" Here we are posted," :says he, " you by accident,
and I bymy own choice, in a part of the world very rev
mote from my own country; but it is>> in a country where,
by us who understand trade and business, .a great deal
' of money is to be got: if you will put a thousand pounds
'; to my thousand pounds, wewill hire a ship here, the first
we can get to our minds; you shall be captain, I'll be
merchant, and we will go a trading gvoyage to China;
for what shbuld we stand still for? The whole world is
in motion, rolling round and round; all the creatures of
God, heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent;
why should we yidle ? There are no drones," says he, " liv-

gin the world but men: why should we be of that
number ?"

I liked this proposal very well, and the more because
it seemed to be expressed with so much good- will, and in
so friendly a manner. I will not say but that I might,
by my loose and unhing ed circumstances, be the fitter to

- ' ' embrace a proposal for trade, and indeed for anything

else; or otherwise trade was none of my element; how-
t,ever, I might perhaps say with some truth, that if trade
, was not my element, rambling was; and no proposal for
seeingany ypart of the world, which I had never seen be-
f.ore, could possibly come amiss to me.
It was, however, some time before we could get a ship
zto our mind; and when we got a vessel, it was not easy
to get English sailors; that is to say, so many as were
, necessary to govern the voyage, and manage the sailors
which we should pick up there. After some time we got
a mate, aboatswain, and a gunner, English, aDiitch car-
penter, and three Portuguese foremast-men: with these
we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen,
such as they are, to make up
There are so many travellers who have written the
history of their voyages and travels this way y, that it
would be but very little diversion to anybody to give a
long account of the places we went to, and the peop ple who
inhabit there; those things I leave to others, and refer
the reader to those] oumals and travels of Englishmen,
many of which, I find, are published, and more promised
every day. It' is enough for me to tell you that we made
, the voyage to Achin,'in the island of Sumatra, first; and ,
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our.
wares for opium, and some for arrack; the first a com-
modity which bears a great price among the Chinese, and
which, at that time, was very much wanted there; in a' A successron ADVENTURE. *1 473 '

.word,' we went up to Susham, made a very great voyage, :
- were eight months out; and. returned to Bengal; and. I

i was very well satisfied with my adventure.

I observe, that our people in England often admire

7 how the oflicers whom the Company send into India, and
'.the merchants who generally stay there, get such very
good estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth

' sixty, seventy, and a hundred thousand pounds at a
time" But it is no wonder, or at least, we shall see so
much further into it, when we consider the innumerable
ports and places where they have a free commerce, .that
it will then be no wonder; and much less will it be so, '
when we consider, that at all those places and ports where
the English ships come, there is so much, and such con-
stant demand for the growth of all other countries, that.
there is a certain vent for the return, as well as a market ' '
abroad for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so
'much money by the first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that had I been twenty
years younger, I shOuld have been tempted to have staid
here, and sought no farther for making my fortune; but .
what was all this to a-man on the wrong side of three-,
score, that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a
covetous desire of getting in it '2 And, indeed, I think
it is with great justice that I now call it a restless desire,-
for it was so: when I was at home, I was restless to go
abroad; and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at -
home. I say what was this gain to me? I was rich
enough already; nor had I any uneasy desires about get- '
ting more money; and therefore, the profits of the voy-
age were things of no great force to me, for the prompting
me forward to further undertakings: hence I thought,-
that by this voyage I had made no progress at all; because

I was come back, as I might call it, to the place from
whence I came, as to a home; whereas my eye, which,
like that which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied
with seeing--was still more desirous of wandering and
seeing I was come into a part of the world which I' 474. LIFE AND Ann-muses on! aosmsox asusox. '

never was in before--and that part 1n particular, which
I had heard much of--and was resolved to see as much 7'.
of it as I could; and then I thought I might say I had
seen all the world that was worth seeing.
But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions. I
do not naine this to insist upon my own, for I acknowledge. ~
his was most just, and the most suited to the end of a
merchant's life; who, when he 1s abroad up on adventures,
it 1s his wisdomto stick to that, as the bespt thing for him,
which he 18 like to get the most money by. My new friend
he p.t himself to the nature of the thing, and would have '
been content to have gone, like a carrier' 8 horse, always
to the same inn, backward and forward, providedhe could,
as he called it, find his account 1n it--on the other hand: -
.mine, as old as I was, was the notion of a mad rambling f,
boy, that never cares to see a thing twice over. .'
But this was not all. I had a kind of' imp atience upon '
me to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled resolu-
tion imagm able which way to go. In the interval of these
consultations, my friend, who was always on the search f
for business, proposed another voyage to me, namely, :'.'
among the Spice Islands; and to bring home a load of :
cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places where, '_
indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the islands belong partly L
to the Spaniards; though we went not so far, but to some -
other, where they have not the whole power, as they have 'f
at Batavia, Ceylon, at. We were not long in preparing .
for this voyage; the chief difiiculty was in bringing me -
to come into it; however, at last, nothing else offering, '
and finding that really stirring about angd trading, the
profit being so great, and, as I may ysay, certain, had
more pleasure in it, and more satisfaction to the mind,-
than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the un-
<<happiest part of life, Iresolved on this voyage too, which
we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and sever ,
ral islands, whose, names I do not gremember, and came"
home in about five monthst We sold our spice,- which
was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs, tothe Persian mere -
chants, who carried them away for the Gulf, and, making
near five of one, we really got a great deal of moneng:3, .. rummsr. or A SHIP. ,

, a My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at.
' men: I-'fWell, now," said he, with a sort of an agreeable
msult upon my indolent temper, " is not this better than

;' walking about here, like aman of nothing to do, and
j spending our time in staring'at the nonsense and ignor-

; ance of the Pagans?" "Why, truly," said I, "my friend,
iI think it is; and I begin tobe aconvert to theprin-.

; ciples of merchandising. But I must tell you]? said I,'
- '.' by the way, you do not know what I am doing; for if '
, once I conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily,-
as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world
' till I tire you: for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall
never let you lie at ." .

: But to be short with my speculations. A little while
after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she>>a
was a coaster, not an European trader, and of about two
hundred tons burden: the men, as they pretended, hav-
ing been so sickly, that the captain had not men enough
to go to' sea, he lay by at Bengal; and, as if having got
money enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go
for. Europe, he gave public notice that he would sell his
ship: this came to my ears before my new partner heard
of it ; and I had a great mind to buy it. So Iwent home
"to him, and told him of it 2 he considered a while, for he
was no rash man neither; but musing some time, he re:
lied," She is a little too big ;. but, however, wewill have
er.'?-- Accordingly, we bought the ship: and agreeing
with the master, we paid for her, and took possession;
when we had done so, we resolved to entertain the men,
if we could, to join them with those we had, for the pur-
suing our business; but on a sudden, they not having
received their wages, but their share of the money, as we
afterwards learnt, not one of them was to be found. We '
inquired much about them, and at length were told that
they were all gone tog'ether;by land, to Agra, the great-
'city of the Mogul's residence; and from thence were to--
travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf of. Persia>>; .
as Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as
that I. missed the opportunity of going with them ;. for .
such a ramble, I thought, and in such companyas would

suited mightily with my great design; 'and I should both , '
have seen the world, and gone homewards too; buthas
much better satisfied a few days after, when I came to -
know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their
history was, that this man they called captain was the
gunner only, not the commander; that they had been a
trading voyage, in which they were attacked on shore by>>
some of the Malaccans, who had killed the captain and '
three of his men; and that after the captain was killed,
these men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away
with the ship, which they did; and had brought her in
at the Bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more
on shore; of whom we shall hear further. ,
Well; let them come by the ship how they would, we.
came honestly by her, as we thought, though we did not,
I confess, examine into things so exactly as we ought;
for we never inquired anything of the seamen, who, if
we had examined; would certame have faltered in their
_ accounts, contradicted one another, and perhaps have
contradicted themselves; or, one how or other, we should.
have seen reason to have suspected them: but the man
showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel
Clostershoven, or some such name (for I suppose it was
all a forgery), and called himself by that name, and we
could not contradict him; and being withal a little too'
unwary, or at least having no suspicion of the thing, we'
- went through with our bargain. ' , - -

 

CHAPTER XXXI. "
Hownvnn, we picked up some English seamen here after

- this, and some Dutch, and we now resolved for a second
voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &c.; that is to say;
among the Philippine and Molucca isles; and, in short,
not to fill this part of my story with trifies, when what
is yet to come is so remarkable, 'I spent, from first to last;
six years in this country, trading from port to port, back, Ward and forward,'and with very good success; and was
now the last year with my partner, goingin the ship above-
mentioned, on a voyage to China, but designing first to go
to Siam, to buy rice. .
In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat '
up and down a great while in the straits of Malacca, and
among the islands, we were no sooner got clear Of those
difiicult seas, but we found our ship had sprung a leak,
_ and we were not able, by all our industry, to find out
where it was. This forced us to make for some port; and
my partner, who knew the country better than I did, direct-
ed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for I
'_ had made the English mate, one Mr Thomson, captain,
not being willing to take the charge of the ship upon myself.
This river lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf,
which goes up to Siam. ' '
= .While we were here, and going often on shore for re-
freshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman,
and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board an Eng-
' .1ish East India ship, which rode in the same river, up at,

V ' ::-I looked steadfastly at him for a while, and he thought

you have no knowledge of it." " I know no danger I am
in," said I,' " but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find
it out ; . but I propose to lay her aground to-morrow, to
see if I can find it." "But, sir," says he, "leaky or not'

man that is upon such adventures as you are, to come
into a port, and not examine first what ships there are ,
there, and whether he is able to deal with them '1' I supe

amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it, . .
for I could not conceive what he meant; and I turned
short upon him, and said, " Sir, I wish you would explain
yourself; I cannot imagine what reason.I have to be
afraid of any of the Company' s ships, or Dutch ships, I
am no interloper; what can they have to say to me? " '

pausing a while, but smiling, "Well, sir,"P says he, "if
you think yourself secure, you must take your chance--'-
I am sorry your fate should blind you against good ad-

" I should have met with a better reception than this for-
doing you a piece of service of such importance." .'-'1
can never be ungrateful," said I, 'f for any service, or to
any man that offers me any kindness, but it' 1s past my
comprehension," said I, "what they should have such a
design upon me for: however, since you say there' is no
time to be lost, and that there' 1s some villanous design
in hand against me, I will go on board this minute, and
put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or
if we can swim without stopping it: but, sir," said I,

  

" shall I go away ignorant of the reason of all this ? Can _

you give me no further light into it ?"
. "I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he; -
"but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I be-
lieve, I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there
is scarce time for it: but the short of the story is this,
the first part of which, I suppose, you know well enough
--'-namely, that you were with this ship at Sumatra; that

were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and. ,
are since turned mm. This is the sum of the story,-
and you will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you,
and executed with very little ceremony; for you know
merchant ships show but little law to pirates, if they get>>
them in their power.'.' ~ .
'" Now you speak plain English,".said I, " and I th
you ,;- and though I know nothing that we have done, like
what you talk of, but I am sure we came honestly and
fairly by the ship; yet seeing such work is a-doing', as
you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will be
upon-my guard." "Nay, sir," says he, "do not talk of
being upon your guard; the best defence is to be out of
the danger: if you have any regard to your life, and the
lives of all your men, put out to sea, without fail, at high
_ water; and as you have a whole tide before you, you will
, be gone too far out before they can come down; for they
will come away at high water; and as they have twenty
miles to come, you'll get near two hours of them by the
difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of the
way: besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they
'will not venture to follow you far out to sea, especially
if it blows." , .
"Well," said I, " you have been very kind in this:
.what shall I do for you to make you amends 9" " Sir,"
, sayshe, "you may not be so willing to make me amends,
* because you may not be convinced of the truth of it: I
willimake an ofier to you; I have nineteen months' pay
due to me on board the ship -------, which I came out of
England in, and the Dutchman that is with me has seven
months' pay due to him; if you will make good our pay
5 to: us, we will go along with you: if you find nothing
more in it, we will desire no more; but if we do convince
you that we have saved your life, and the ship, and the
lives of all ,the men in herg'we' will leave the rest to you."
.1- -: I consented 'to this readily, and went immediately on'
'1' , board, and the two men with me. As soon as I came to'
7 the ship's side, my partner, who was on board, came on
, the quarter-deck, and called to me with a great deal of
joy, " 0 ho! 0 ho! we have stopped the leak l" " Say you
- .so ?" said I;""thank God; ,but weigh the anchor, then,-

immediately." "Weigh I" says he, "what do you mean
by that ? What is the matter ?" says he. " Ask no ques-
tions," said I, " but all hands to work, and weigh with-

out losing a minute." He was surprised: but, however,

he called the captain, and he immediately ordered the

anchor to be got up, and, though the tide was not quite ' .

done, yet a little land breeze blowing, we stood out to

sea; then I calledhim into the cabin, and told him the"

story at large; and we called in the men, and they told
us the rest of it: but as it took us up a great deal of
time, so before we had done, a seamen comes to the cabin

door, and calls out to us, that the captain bade him tell _

us we were chased. _ "Chasedl" said I, " by whom, and
by what ?" "By five sloops, or boats," said the fellow,

"full of men." "Very well," said I, "then it is apparent.

there is something in i ." In the next place, I ordered
all our men to be called up, and told them that there
was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates;

and asked them, if they would stand by us, and by one ..

.4 another? The men answered cheerfully, one and all,
that they would'live and' die with us. Then I asked the
captain, what way he thought best for us to manage a
fight with them, for resist them I resolved we would, and
that to the last drop. He said, readily, that the way
was to keep them off with our great shot-as long as we
could, and then to fire'at them with our small arms, to
keep them from boarding us; but when neither of these

would do any longer, we, should retire to our close quar- ,

ters--perhaps they had not materials to break open our
bulk-heads, or get in upon us.

- The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to bring two
guns to bear fore and aft, out of the cteerage, to clear the
deck, and load them with musket bullets and small pieces

of old iron, and what next came to hand; and thus we _

made ready for fight, but all this while kept out to sea,
with wind enough, and could see the boats at a distance,

being five large long-boats, following us with all the sail

I they could make. -

see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near two-
" .leagues a-headof them, and gained upon us considerably,
so that we found they would come up with us; upon
which 'we'fired a gun without a shot, to intimate that
' they should bring to, and we put out a flag of truce as a
signal for parley, but they kept crowding after us till they
came within shot. Upon this, we tookin our white flag,
they having made no answer to it, hung out the red flag,
' and fired at them with shot: notwithstanding this, they
'came on till they were near enough to call to them with
a speaking-trumpet which we had on board ; so we called
to them, and bade them :keep 01f at their peril. .
>> It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured
' to come under our stern, so to board us on our quarter;
upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and
depended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered

' to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside,

when immediately we fired five guns at them--one of,

them had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern
of the hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity
E: of taking down their sail, and running all to the head of
. the boat to keep her from sinking--so she lay by, and had
? enough of it ; but seeing the foremost boat still crowd on

' after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.

_> While this was doing, one of the three boats that was
_ behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up to

the boat which we had disabled to relieve her, and we

could afterwards see her take out the men; we called

. again to the foremost boat, and offered a truce to parley

again, and to know what was her business with us ; but
had no answer, only she crowded closeunder our stern.

Upon this our gunner, who was avery dexterous fellow,
ran out his two chase guns, and fired at her, but the shot
missing, the men inthe boat shouted, waved their caps, -
and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly ready
again, fired among them a second time, one shot of which,

, 'though it missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, ,
and, we couldeasily see, had done a great deal, of miss-
chief amongthem; but we, taking no notice of that,
weared the ship again, and birought our quarter to bear,

upon them, and, firing three guns more, we found the
boat was split almost to pieces; in particular, her rudder, :
and a piece of her stern, were shot quite, away, so they :
handed their sail immediately, and Were in great disorder: ,
but, to complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two
guns at them again; where he hit them we could not tell, :-
but we found the boat was sinldng,'and some of the men
already in the water. Upon this, I imrmdiately manned
out our pinnace, which We had kept close by our side, with
orders to pick up some of the men, if they cauld, and save
them from drowning, and immediately to come on board
with them because we saw the rest of the boats began to ~
come up. Our men in the pinnace follomd their orders, i
and took up three men, one of whom was just drowning, _.
~ and it was a good while before we could recover him. As -'
soon as they were on board, We crowded all the sail we 1
could make, and stood farther out to sea: and we found,
that when the other three boats came up to the first two,
they gave over their chase. . , .'
Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I '
, knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater
than Iapprehended, I took care that We should change
our course, and not let any one imagine whither we Were
going; so we stood out to sea eastward, quite-out of the. 1
course of all European ships, whether they mrerbound
to China, or' anywhere else within the commerce of the
European nations; '

When we were now at sea, we began to consult with
the two semen, and inquire, first, what the meaning of
all this should be '2 The Dutchman let us into the secret
of it at once, telling us, that the fellow that sold us the
ship, as we said, was.no more than a thief that had run
away with her, . Then he told us how the captain, whose

- name too he mentioned, though I do not remember it
now, was treacherously murdered by the natives on the
coast of Malacca, with three of his men; and that he,
this Dutchman, and four more, get into the woods, where
they Wandered about a great while, till at length he, in
particular, in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and
swam on to a Dutch ship, which sailing near the shore,' I ' <<L 'J

Inronmrmu er run DUTCH "11.033372? 483

v in its way from China,'had sent' their boat on shore for
fresh water--that he durst not come to that part of the
shore where the boat Was, but made shift in the night to
take in the Water farther off, and, swimming a great while,
at last the ship's boat took him up. >> ' * i
. He then told us, that he Went to Batavia, where two
of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived, having
'deserted the rest in their travels; and gave an account,-
that the fellow who had run away with the ship, sold her'
at Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone a-cruising
in her ;' and that they had already taken an English ship
3: and two Dutch ships, very richly laden.
_, This latter part we found to concern us directly; and
though we knew it to be false, yet as my partner said very
well, if we had fallen into their hands, and they had such
a prepossession against us beforehand, it had been in vain
. for us to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good
quarters at their hands; especially considering that our
accusers had been our judges, and that we could have A
expected nothing fiom them but what rage would have
dictated, and ungoverned passion have executed; and
therefore, it was his opinion, we should go directly back to
Bengal, from whence we came, without putting in at any
'- port whatever; because there we could give an account
of ourselves, and could prove where We were when the
ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the like; and,
. which was more than all the rest, if we were put to the
; necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we should .
r be sure to have some justice; and not be hanged first,
. I and judged afterwards. ' . '
_, .. -'.' I was some timo of my partner's opinion; but after a
;. . little more serious thinking, I told..him, I thought it was
' ' a Very great hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben.
' ' gal, for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of
Malacca; and that, if the alarm was given, we should be
sure to be Waylaid on every side, as well by the Dutch of
Batavia as the English elsewhere; that if we should be
taken, as it Were, running away, we should even condom
burSeIVes, and there would want no more evidence to de-,
stray us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who , '
484 me'mn invauruaas or aonmsoN censor.

said he was of my mind, and that we should certainly be .
taken.

This danger a little startled my partner, and all the "-
ship' s company , and we immediately resolved to go away
to the coast of Ton quin, and so on to China; and from
thence, pursuing the first design ign, as to trade, find some
way or other to dispose of the ship, and come back in some
of the vessels of the country, such as we could get. This .
was approved of, as the best method for our security , and,
accordingly, we steered away north-north- east, keeping
abovle fifty leagues off from the usual course to the east- -
war

This, however, putus to some inconveniences, for, first,
the winds, when we came to that distance from the shore,
seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing almost
trade, as we call it, from the east and east- north-east; so
that we were a long while upon our voyage, and we were
but ill provided with victuals for so long a run; and,

' ' which was still worse, there was some dang er that these

English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, whereof
. some were bound that way, might be got in before us ,
and if not, some other ship bound to China, might have _
information of us from them, and pursue us with the same ~
vigour. ,
I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought my- '
self, including the late escape from the long b-oats,g to have
been in the most dangerous condition that ever I was in
through all my past life; for, whatever ill circumstances I
had been in, I was never pursued for a thief before; nor had
I ever done anything that merited the name of dishonest
or fraudulent, much less thievish. I had chiefly been '
_ mine own enemy; or, as I might rightly say, I had been
nobody 's enemy but my own. But now I was embar-
rassedy' in the worst condition' imagin able, for though I
was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make
that innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it had
been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind--at least
a crime esteemed so among the people I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape, though A
which way to do it I knew not; or what port or place we"" ,ARRIVES AT THE BA! or TONQUIN." 1"" 485

should go to. .My partner seing me thus dejected, though
. he was the most concerned at first, began to encourage
me; and describing to me the several ports of that coast,

\ told me he would put in on the coast of Cochin-China, or
' the bay of Tonquin; intending to go afterwards to Macao,
a town once in the possession of the Portuguese, and where
still a great many European families resided, and particu-

' 7' larly missionary priests usually went thither, in order to

 

their going forward to China. -
' '- , ' Either we then resolved to go ; and accordingly, though
after a tedious and irregular course, and very much strait-
- ened for provisions, we came within sight of the coast very
early in the morning; and upon reflection upon the past
circumstances we were in, and the danger, if we had not
escaped, we resolved to put into a small river, which, how
ever, had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we
could, either overland, or by the ship's pinnace, come to
know what ships were in any ports thereabbuts. - This
happy step was, indeed, our deliverance; for though we
did notimmediately see any European ships in the bay of
Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay
two Dutch ships; and a third without any'colours spread
out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by
at about two leagues' distance, steering for the coast of
' China;. and .in the afternoon went by two English ships, '
steering the same course; and thus we thought we saw
ourselves beset with enemies, both one way and the other.
The place we were in was wild and barbarous; the people

' _ thieves, even by occupation or profession: and though, it

 
  

is true, 'we had not much to seek of .them,'and,'except
getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had to do
with them, yet it was with much difliculty that we kept
_ ourselves from being insulted by them several ways. '

CHAPTER XXXII.

' , WE were in a small river of this country, within a few
pleagues of its utmost limits northward, and by our boat '
we coasted north-east to- the point of land which opens
to the great bay of Tenquin: and it was in this beating
up along the shore that we discovered as above, that, in
a Word, we were surrounded with enemies. The people
we were among were the most barbarous of all the in- '
habitants of the coast; having no correspondence with
any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and
such gross commodities; and it may be particularly seen
that they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any of the
inhabitants, namely, that among other customs they have
this one, that if any vessel had the misfortune to be shipe
wrecked upon their coast, they presently make the men'
all prisoners, that is to say, slaves; and it was not long
before we found a spice of their kindness this way, on the - '
occasion following :-- - . g .
I have observed above, that our ship sprang a leak at
sea, and that we could not find it out ; and however it
happened, that, as I have said, it was stepped unexpectedv
ly, in the happy minute of our being to be seized by the '
Dutch and English ships, near the bay of Siam; yet, as
we did not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound as
we desired, we resolved, while we were in this place, to
lay her on shore, take out What heavy things we had on
board, which were not many, and to wash andclean her
bottom, and, if possible, to find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all
our guns, and other moveable things, to one side, we tried
to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom;
for, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her dry
aground, neither could we find out a proper place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with.
such a sight, came wondering down to .the shore to look
at us ;- and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a
, manner, and heeling towards the shore, and not seeing our
men, who were at work on her bottom with stages, and with
their boats on the off side, they presently concluded that
the ship was cast away, and lay so very fasten the ground. ;'
On this supposition, they came all about us in two or
three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats, having
some of them eight, some ten men ins boat, intendingno doubt, to have come on board and plunder the ship;
and if they had found us there, to have carried us away
3 for slaves to their king. or whatever they call him, for we
>>'knew not who was their governor.
. << e, When they came up to the ship, and began to row round
- _ '1 her, they discovered as all hard at work, on the outside
_; of the ship's bottom and side, washing, and graving, and
.3- stopping, as every seafaring man knows how. 4 .
" - r They stood for a While gazing at us, and we, who were
, 'a'little surprised, could not imagine what their design was ;
but being Willing, to be sure, we took this opportunity to
get some of us into the ship, and others to hand down .
arms and ammunition to those that were at. work, to do:
fend themselves with, if there should be occasion; and it
was no more than need, for in less than a quarter of an
hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship
Was really a wreck ; that we were all at work endeavouring
to save. her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats;
;; ~ and when we handed our game into the boats,>> they 0deg11"
-' eluded by that motion that we were endeavouring to save '
some of our goods. Upon this, they took it for granted
they all belonged to them, and away they came directly
,3 , _. upon our men, as if it had been in a line of battle.
3, Our men seeing so many of them, began to be frighted,
"' for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us
to know what they should do ? I immediately called to
the men who worked upon the stages, to slip them down,
5 and get up the side into the ship, and bade those in the boat
f to row round and come on board, and these few of us who
; were on board, worked with all the strength and hands we
, had, to bring the ship to rights; but, however, neither the
men upon the stage, nor those in the boats, could do as
they were ordered, before the Cochin-Chinese were upon
1, ' them, and, with two of their boats, boarded our long-boat,
' and began to lay hold oi the men as theirprisoners,
The first man they laid hold of was-an English seaa
~ <<man, a. stout strong fellow, who having a musket in his
'r: . hand, never ofi'ered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat,
' like a feel, as I thought. But he understood his business
. ' better than I could teach him: for he grappled thefagan,

 

 

  
 
 

' armour or m ooemn-onmnsa. . '48.? 7and dragged him by main force out of their own boat
' into ours, where, taking him by the two ears, he beathis
head so against the boat's sgunnel, that the fellow died
'instantly in his hands; and, in the meantime, a Dutch-
man, who stood next, took up the musket, and, with the
butt-end of it, so laid about him, that he knocked down
five of them who attempted to enter the boat. But this
was little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who fear-
less, because ignorant of their danger, began to throw'
themselves into the long-boat, where we had but five men
to defend it. But one accident gave our men a complete , a
victory, which deserved our laughter rather than any-' '
thing else, and that was this:--

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of
the ship as well as to pay the seams where he caulked
her to stop the leaks, hady got two kettles just let down
into the boat; one filled with boilingp itch, Jand the other ,
with rosin, tallow, and oil, and suchP stufi' as the ship->>
'wrights used for that work; and the man that tended
the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with
' which he supplied the men" that were at work with that

hot stuff: two of the enemy's men entered the boat just
' where the fellow stood, being in the foresheets ; he im-
mediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling
'hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being half naked,
_ that they roared out like two bulls, and, enraged with
' the fire, leap ed both into the sea. The carpenter saw it,
and cried out, " Well done, Jack, give them some more
of it; " when stepping forward himself, he takes one of
their mops, and dipping it in the pitch- po,t he and his '
man threw it among them so plentifully,P that, in short,
of all the men in three boa s, there was not one that was
not scalded and burnt with it in a most fii ghtful,p itiful
manner, and made such a howling and crying, that I

' . never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, nothing like it,

for it was worth observing, that though pain naturally
makes all people cry out, yet every nation have a parti-

cular way of exclamation, and make noises as different . '3?"

from one another as their speech. I cannot give the.
noise these creatures made a better name than howling,.nor' a name more proper to the tone of it; for I never '

~ heard anything more like the noise of the wolves, which,
- as I have said, I heard howl in the forest 0n the fron-
' tiers of Languedoo. ~ .

3: I was never pleased with a victory better in my life;
not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our
danger was imminent before; but as we got this victory
without anybloodshed, except of that man the" fellow
killed with his naked hands, and which I was very much
concerned at; for I was sick of killing such poor savage
wretches, even though it was in my own defence, know-
ing they came on errands which they'thought just, and
knew no better; and that though it may be a just thing,
' because necessary, fonthere is no necessary wickedness.
in nature, yet I thought it was a sad life, when we must
be always obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to

' - preserve ourselves--and, indeed, I think so still--and I

would, even now, suffer a great'deal, rather than I would
take away the life even of the worst person injuring me.
I believe also, all considering people, who know the value
of life, would be of my opinion, if they, entered Seriously
into the consideration of it.' , .
_. But to return to my story. All the while this was doing,
my partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on
board, had, with great dexterity, brought the ship almost
to rights, and, having gotten the guns into their places
again, the gunner called me to bid our boat get out of the
way, for he would let fly among them. I called back again

7 ' to him, and bade him not offer to fire, for the carpenter

 

would do the work without him; but bade him heat and
other pitch-kettle, which our cook,'who was .on board,
took care of. But the enemy was so terrified with what
they met with in their first attack, that they would not
come on again: and some of them that were farthest ofi',.
' seeing the ship swim, as-- it were, upright, began, as we
supposed, to see their mistake, and gave over the enter-
prise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got
_ clear of this merry fight; and having gotten some rice,
" and some roots and bread, with about sixteen good big
,hogs on board, two days before, we resolved to stay here496 me we snmsrosas or aoemsou censor.

no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it; 'for' we '
made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next
day with rogues enough--perhaps more than our pitch-
kettle would dispose of for us.

We, therefore, got all our things on board the same
, evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. In
the meantime, lying at an anchor some distance from the
shore, we were not so much Iconcerned, being now in a
fighting posture as well as in a sailing posture, if any
enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our
work within board, and finding our ship was perfectly
healed of all her leaka, we set sail. We would have gone
into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves
of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that
had been there; but we durst not stand' in there, because we
had seen several ships gain, as we supposed, but a little
before; so we kept on north- east, towards the isle of For.
.moso, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
merchant ship as a Dutch or English merchant ship 1n
the Mediterranean 13 of an Algerine man-of- -wsr.

When we were thus gone to sea, we kept on north- east,
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands,
and this we did, that we might not fall into the way of any
of the European ships; and then we steered north again,
till we came to the latitude of twenty-two degrees twenty
minutes, by which means we made the island of Formosa
directly, where we came to an anchor," m order to get water
and fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very
courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us with will--
ingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all
their engagements and bargains' which is what we did not
'find among other people, and maybe owing to the remains
of Christianity y, which was once planted here by a Dutch
mission of Protestants, and 1s a testimony of what I have
often observed, namely that the Christian religion always
civilises the people, and reforms their manners, where it 1s
received, whether it works saving effects upon them or not.

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond
all the ports oqf China where our European ships usually. moresn. in sun roe rue sum or mucus! s91.~

come; but being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any

' . of their hands, especially in this country, where, as our cir- -

 

- cumstanoes were, we could not fail of being entirely ruined ;
nay, so great was my fearin particular, as to my being taken
by them, that I believe firmly I would much rather have
chosen to fall into the hands of the Spanish" Inquisition.
Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we
resolved to put into the first trading port we should come
at: and, standing in for the shore, a boat came ofi? two
leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who,
knowing us to be an European ship, came to offer his ser-
vice. which. indeed, we were very glad of. and took him on
board; upon which, without asking us whither we would >>
go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it back.
' I thought it was now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would. that I began to
talk to him about carrying us to the Gulf of Nanquin.
which is the most northern part of the coast bf China-x
The old man said he knew the Gulf of Nanquin very well;
but, smiling, asked us what we would do there? ~ '
- I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase China
wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &o., and so
Would return by the same course we came. He told us
our best port had been to have put in at Macao, where
'we' could not fail of a market for our~ Opium to our satis-
faction, and might, for our money, have purchased all
sorts of China goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin. .
' Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of
which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told him
we were gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we barf
a mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the
-famous court of the monarch of China. "Why, then,"
says the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where, by '
the river that runs into the sea there, you may go up within
* five leagues of the great canal." This canal is a nevi-v
gable made stream, which goes though the heart of all
, that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers; passes
some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates,
and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in lengthnearly
two hundred and seventy leagues. '
, " Well," said I, " Seignior Portuguese, but that' 1s not
our business now, the great question 1s, if you can carry
us up to' the city of Nanquin, from whence we can travel
to Pekin afterwards ?" "Yes," he said. "he could do so-
ry;well and there was a great Dutch ship gone up that
way ryjust before." This gave me a little shock; a Dutch
ship was now our terror. We depended upon it that a
Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no
condition to fig ht them, all the ship s they trade with m
those parts being of great burden, and ofy much greater
force than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and said to me,
" Sir, you need be under no apprehension of the Dutch; ,
I suppose they are not now at war with your nation. "' .
" No," said I, " that's true, but I know not what liberties
men may take when they are out of the reach of the laws
of their country." " Wh y," said he, " you are no pirate;
what need you fear ? They will not meddle with peace-
able merchants, sure. "

If I had any blood 1n my body that did not fl yup into
my face at that word, it was hindered by some ystop in
the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it--for it put
me into the greatest disorder and confusion imaginable ,
nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but that the
old man easily perceived it.

" Sir," said he, "I find you are in some disorder' 1n
your thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which
way you think fit, and, depend upon it, I' 11 do you all the
service I can.' " Why y, seignior,' said I, "it 1s true I
am a little unsettled 1n my resolution a this time whither
to go in particular; and I am something more so for what
you said about-pirates. I hop 9 thereg are no pirates in
these seas; we are but in ill condition to meet with them ,
for you see we have but a small force, and but very
weakly manned." . ,

" O sir,' 'said he, "do not be concerned; I do not know _
that there have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen '

years, except one, which was seen. as I hear, in the bay
of Siam, about a month since ; but you may be assured shecomesmou WITH 4 roarueossn 211.911, 498 '

is gone to the southward; nor was she a ship of any great
A force, or fit for the work ; she was not built for a privateer,
but was run away with by a reprobate crew that were on
board, after the captain and some of his men had been
murdered by the Malaccans, at or near the island of Su-
matra." ' '-- '
\ " What I" said I, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, "did they murder the captain? " "N03? said
. he, "I do not understand that they murdered him; but
a as they afterwards ran away with the ship, it is generally
believed they betrayed him into the hands of the Malac-
cans, who did murderhim; and, perhaps, they procured
' them to do it." " Why, then," said I, they deserved death
' 'as much as if they had done it themselves." " N ay," said '
the old man, "they do deserve it, and theywill certame
have it if they light upon any English or Dutch ship ;: for,
' they have all agreed together, that if they meet that rogue
r they will give him no quarter." 7 E .
E "But," said I to him, "you say the pirate is gone out
-': of these seas ; how can they meet withhim then ?" " Why,
that is true," said he, " they do say so ;' but he was, as
' I tell you, in the. bay of Siam,'in the river. Cambodia, and
was discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to
the ship,~and who were left on shore when they ran away
with her; and some English and Dutch traders being in
the river, they were within a little of taking him. N ay,".

:said he, " if the foremost boats had been well seconded by
the rest, they had certainly taken him; but he, finding

only ,two boats within reach of him, tacked about, and

fired at these two, and disabled them before the others

came up; and then, standing ofl' to sea, the Others were

not able to follow him, and so he got away. But they
A have all so exact a description of the ship, that they will

be sure to know him; and, wherever they find him, they
' have. vowed to give noquarter to either the captain or
' seamen, but to hang them all .up at the yard-arm."

f " What I" said I, "will they execute them, right or
wrong; hang them first, and judge them afterwards ?"
" O sir I" said the old pilot, "there is no need to make a"
formal business of it with such rogues as those; let them
tie them back to back, and set them a-diving; it is no
more than they rightly deserve." , ' .
- < I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he Gould .
I do me no harm; so I turned short upon him. "Wellh
seignior," said I, " and this is the very reason why I would
have you carry us to Nanquin, and not to put back to Ms.-
cao, or to any other part of the ocuntry where'the Eng-
lish or Dutch ships came ; for, be it known to you, seignior,
those captains of the English and Dutch ships are a parcel
of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know what'
belongs to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the
. laws of God and nature direct; but,,being proud of their
offices, and not understanding their power, they would
act the murderers to punish robbers--mould take upon
them to insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guiltywithout due inquiry ; and, perhaps, I may live to'eall
some of themto an account of it, where they may be taught
how justice is to be executed; and that no man ought tq

'be treated as a criminal, till some evidence may be ,had

of the crime, and that he is the man." "
With this I told him, that this was the very ship they
had attacked -; and gave him a full account of the skirmish
we had with the boats, and how foolishly and coward-like
they had behaved. I told himall the story of our buying
the ship, and how the Dutchmen served us. I told him
the reasons I had to believe that this story of killing the
_ master by the Malaccans was not true, as also the run.

ning away with the ship; but that it was all a fictiou of
their own, to suggest that the men were turned pirates;
and they ought to have been sure it was so, before they
had ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to
resist them; adding, that they would have the blood of
those men who were killed there, in our just defence, to
answer for.

- The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us, '_ 2
we were very much in the right to go away to the north; '
and that if he might advise us,rit should be to sell the ship
in China, which we might very Well do, and buy or build 7
another in the country, "And," said he,."though you, y
will not get so good a ship, yet you may get one able , 5'3

enough to carry you and all your goods back again to
Bengal, or anywhere else."
. -_ I told him I would take his advice when I came to any
port where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any
customer to buy this; He replied, I should meet with cusa
tomers enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese
junk would serve me very well to go back again ; and that he
would procure me people both to buy one and sell the other.
a " Well, but seignior," says I, "as you say they know
the ship so Well, I may, perhaps, if I fo ow yourmeasures,
be inetrunmntal to bring some henest, innocent men
, into a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be murdered in cold
, blood; for wheneVer they find the ship, they willsprove
the guilt upon the men, by proving this was the ship ; and
so innocent men may probably be overpowered and mura'
deredx" "Why," said the old man, "I'll find out a Way
to prevent that also; for as I know all those commanders
you speak of very well, and shall see them all as. they pass
by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and
.let them know that they had been so much in the Wrong ;
- that though the eople who were on board at first might
' run away with e ship, yet it was not true that they had
. , turned pirates; and that in particular those Were not the
. ' men that first went 01? with the ship, but innooerfifi
bought her for their trade; and I am persuaded they '
so far believe me, as, at least, to act more cautiousl for
the time to come." " Well," said I, "andwillyou de 'ver
one message to them from me 9", 'f Yes, I will," says he,
"if you will give it under your hand in writing, that I
niay be able to preve it came from you, and not out of my
own head." I answered that I Would readily give, it him
. under my hand. So I took a pen and ink, and paper, and
wrote at large the story of assaulting me with the long
boats, &c., the pretended reason of it, and the unjust, cruel
design of it; and concluded to the commanders, that they
had done what they not only should have been ashamed
of, but also, that if ever they Came to England, and I lived
to see them there, they should all pay dearly for it, if, the

My old pilot read this over and over again, and asked 9,
me several times if Iwould stand to it. I answered, I
would stand to it as long as I had any thing left in the
world; being sensible'that I should, one time or other,
find an opportunity to put it home to them. But we had '
no occasion ever to let the pilot carry this letter, for he
never went back again. While these things Were pass-
ing between us, by the way of discourse, we went forward
directly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days' sail,
came to anchor at the south-west point of the great Gulf
of Nanquin, where, by the way, I came by accident to ,
understand, that the two Dutch ships were gone that
length before me, and that I should certainly fall into
'their hands. I consulted my partner again in this exi-

gency, and he was as much at a loss as I was', and would
very gladly have been safe on shore almost anywhere.
However, I was not in such perplexity neither, but I
asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour, which
I might put into, and pursue my business with the
Chinese privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He
told me, if I would sail to the southward about two-and-
forty leagues, there was a little port called Quinchang,
where the fathers of the mission usually landed from
Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian religion
to the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put
in: and if I thought proper to put in there I might con-
sider what further course to take when I was on shore.>> _
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants, ' '
except that at some certain times they had a kind of a
fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over
thither to buy the Chinese merchandise. ' '_

We all agreed to go back to this place: the name of the
port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell wrong, for I do ,
not particularly remember it, having lost this, together .,.
with the names of many other places set down in a little .
pocket-book, which was spoiled by the water on an accident;

. which I shall relate in its order: but this I remember, that.
the Chinese or J apanese' merchants we correspond with,
call it by a different name from that which our Portuguese;
pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above, Quinchang. 1.;rams FALLING IN WITH DUTCH GAPTAJNS.~ 497 ' y

;- As we were unaminous in our resolutions to go to this
place, we weighed the next day, having only gone twice
on shore, where we were to get fresh water; on both
which occasions the people of the country were very civil

. to us, and brought us abundance of things to sell to us--I

mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some
fowls--but nothing without money.

, ' We came to the other port (the wind being contrary)
-' not till five days; but it was very much to our satisfacu

tion, and I was joyful, and I may say thankful, when I

'set my foot safe on shore, resolving, and my partner too,

that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and efi'ects '
any other way, though not everyway to our satisfaction,--

we would never set one foot on board that unhappy Ves-

sel again: and, indeed, I must acknowledge, that of all
the circumstances of life that ever I had any experience
of, nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as

, that of being in constant fear. Well does the Scripture

say, "The fear of man brings a snare;" it 'is a-- life of
death, and the mind is so entirely oppressed by it, that
it is capable of no relief; the animal spirits sink, and all
the vigour of nature, which usually supports men under
other afiiictions, and is present to them in the greatest
exigencies, fails them here.

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy,
by heightening every danger; representing the English
and Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason,

'or distinguishing between honest men and rogues--orbs-

tween a story calculated for our own turn, made out of
nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true genuine account '
of our whole voyage, progress, and design--for we might ,

manyways have convinced anyreasonable creature that
we were not pirates ; the goods we-had on board, the course
we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and entering
into such and such ports--even our very manner, the force

' we had, the number of men, the few arms, little ammuni-

tion, and short.provisions--all these would have served to

convince any man that we were no pirates. ,The opium,

and other goods we had on board, would make it appear

said, had the names of all the men that were in the ship.
might easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portu-
guese, Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These,
and many other particular circumstances, might have
made it evident to the understanding of any commander,
whose hands We might fall into, that we were no pirates.

But fear, that blind useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our
understandings, and set the imagination at work, to form
a thousand-- terrible things, that, perhaps, might never ,
happen. We first supposed, as indeed everybody had
related to us, that the seamen on board the English and
Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged
at the name of a pirate, and especially at our beating off
their boats, and escaping, that they would not give them-
selves leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no, but
would execute us cit-hand, as we call it, without giving
us any room for a defence. We reflected, that there was
really so much apparent evidence before them, that they
would scarce inquire after any more: as, first, that the
ship was certame the same, and that some of the seamen
among them knew her, and had been on board her; and,
secondly, that when we had intelligence at the river Cam-
bodia, that they were coming down>> to examine us, we
fought their boats, and fled: so that we made no doubt
they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we
were satisfied of the contrary; and I often said, I knew
not but I should have been apt to have taken the like cir- -
cumstances for evidence, if the tables were turned, and
my case was theirs; and have made no-scruple of cutting .' ,1
all the crew to pieces, without behaving, or perhaps cons j}
sidering, what they might have to ofi'er in their defence. '" 1

But let that be how it will, those were our apprehen-
sions; and both my partner, and I too, scarce slept a
night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms; that
is to say, 'gibbets--of fighting, and being taken--of kill;
ing and being killed. , -

These things tormented me, and my partner too, night
and day; and I cannot refrain taking notice what reflece
tions I now had upon the past variety of my particular'_.=REFLEOTIONB oN P_AST LIFEJ': , 71;.1' 499 '

circumstances ; how hard I thought it was, that I, who
had spent forty years in a life of continued difficulties,>>

and was at last come, as it were, at the port or haven,
which all men drive at, namely, to have rest and plenty,
should be a volunteer in new sorrows, b my own un-

happy choice; and that I, who had escape so many danx
gers in my youth, should now come to be hanged in my

,old age, and' in so remote a place, for a crime I was not

in the least inclined to, much less guilty of ; and in a place
and circumstances, where innocence was not like to be any

protection at all to me.

' After these thoughts, something of religion would come
in; and I would be considering that thisgl seemed to me to
be a disposition of immediate Providence, and I ought to
look upon it, and submit to it as such--that although I
was innocent as to men, I was far fi'om being innocent as
to my Maker _; and I ought to look in, and examine what
other crimes in my life were most obvious to me, and fo!
which Providencey mig ht jyustl inflict this punishment as

1a retribution, and that IJ cu ght to submit to this just as I

Would to a ship wreck, if it had pleased God to have brought
such a disaster upon me.

But by how much the greater weight the anxieties and
perplexities of those things were to our thoughts while we
were at sea, by so much the greater was our satisfaction
when we saw ourselves on shore; and my partner told me
he dreamed that he had a very heavy load-up on his back,
which he was to carryp up a hill, and found that he was not
able to stand long under it; but the Portuguese pilot came,
and took it off ghis back, and the hill disa p,peared the
ground before him showing all smooth and plain: truly it

CHAPTER XXXI II.

For: my part, I had a weight taken 01f from my heart that
'I was not able any longer to bear; and, as 1y said above,
we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we *
came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our. friend,
got us a lodging, and a warehouse for our goods, which,
' by the way, was much the same: it was a little house or

   
 

hut, with a large house joining to it, 9.11 built with canes, l '

' and palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out pil~

fering thieves, of~'which, it seems, there were not a few ,

in the country. However, the magistrates allowed us a
little guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of halbert,
or half-pike, who stood sentinel at our door, to whom we
allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, about
the value of threepence, per day; so that our goods were
kept very safe.

The fair or mart usually kept in this place had been
over for some time; however, we found that there were
threeor four junks in the river, and two J apanners--I
mean ships from Japan, with goods which they had bought
in China, and were not gone away, having Japanese mer-
chants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us, was
to bring us acquainted with three missionary Romish
priests, who were in the town, and who had been there
some time, converting the people to Christianity. One of -
these was a Frenchman, whom they called-Father Simon ;
he was a jolly, well-conditioned man, very free in his con-
versation, not seeming so serious and grave as the other
two did, one of whom was aPortuguese, and the other a ~
Genoese ; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his
manner, and very agreeable company ; the other two were

more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seri- ~ 1}

ously to the'work they came about. This French priest,
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, ,by order of the
chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal seat of
the Chinese Emperor; and waited only for another priest,
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along
with him; and we scarce ever met together but he was
inviting me to go that journey with him, telling me, how
he would show me all the glorious things of that mighty
empire, and amongst the rest, the greatest eityin the world
--" a city," said he, " that your London and our Paris putBUSINESS WITH :1 unmask MERCHAN'JE. 501

together, cannot be equal to. " This was the city of Pekin,
which, Iconfess,isverygreat. andinfinitel yfullofpeople;
but as I looked on those things with different eyes from
other men, so I shall give my opinion of them in few words,
when I come, in the course of my travels, to speak more
_ particularly of them.
Dining with the missionary one day, and being ve
merry together, I showed some little inclinationto gowi .
him; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and
with}; great many persuasions, to consent. I liked this
part of his discourse very well, but we had something
else before us at that time; for we had all this while our
ship and our merchandise to dispose of; and we began
. to be very doubtful what we should do, for we were now
in a 'place of very little business. At length our pros-
pects began to clear up a little. The first thing that of-
. fpered was, that our oldp Portuguese pilot brought a J a pan
merchant to us, who began to inquire what goods we had;
and, in the first place, he bought all our opium, and
gave us a. very good price for it, paying us in gold by
weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some
in small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While
We were dealing with him for our opium, it came into my
head that he might perhaps deal with us for the ship
, too; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to himp
He shrunk up his shoulders at it when it was first pro-
posed to him; but in a few day s after, he came to me,
with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter,
and told me he had a ppro osal to make to me, and that
was this: he had bought a great quantity of goods of us
when he had no thoug ghts (or proposals made to him) of
buying the ship and that, therefore, he had not money
enough to pay for the ship; but if I would let the same
men that were in the ship navigate her, he would hire
the ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence
to the Philippine Islands with another loading,- which he
would pay the freight of before they went to Japan; and
that, at their return, he would buy the ship. I beg an to .
listen to this prop p,osal and so eager did my head still run
upon rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a

notiOn myself of going with him, and so to sail from the _
.Philippine Islands away to the South Seas; and accord-
;ingly I asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire L
' us to the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there. He
:said, no, he could not do that, for then he could'nct have
the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Ja'-_
an, he said, at the ship's return. Well, still I was for
aking him at that proposal, and going myself; but my
partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, repre-
senting the dangers, as well of the seas as of the Japanese, ,
who area false, cruel, treacherous people; and then of the . ,5
:Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, more cruel, more ' '
treacherous than the . -

But, to bring this ong turn of our affairs to aconclu-
sion, the first thing we had to do was to consult with the
captain of the ship, and with the men, and know if they
were willing to go to Japan; and, whileI was doing this, <<
the young man whom, as I said, my nephew had left
with me as my companion for my travels, came to me
and told me, that he thought the voyage promised very

' fair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage,
and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that if
'I would not, and would give him leave, he would go. as
-a merchant, or how I pleased to order him; and if ever .
he came to England, and I was there, and alive, he would , ' ,
render me a faithful account of his success, and it should '
be as much mine as I pleased. ,

I was really loath to part with him ; but considering
the prospect of advantage, which was really Considerable,
and that he was a young fellow, as likely to do well in it
as any I knew, I inclined to let him go; but first I told
him, I would consult my. partner, and give him an an-
swer the next day. My partner and I discoursed about
it, and my partner made a most "generous ofler: he told
me, " You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we
both resolved not to go to sea in it again; if your steward
(so he called my man} will venture the voyage, I'll leave

. my share of the Vesse to him, and let him make the best
of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets
with success abroad, he shall account for one half of the ~_ . oncassFUL anvaurunns. tit, 5'03.

_ being willing to go withhim, we made over half the'ship
to him in property, and took a writing from him, oblig-
ing him to account for the other; and away he went to
Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very punctual -
honest man to him, protected him at Japan, and gothim
a licence to come on shore, which the Europeans in gene'-
ral have not lately obtained, paid him his freight very
punctually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with J a-_
pan and China wares, and a supercargo of, their own,-
who, trafiicldng with the Spaniards, brought back Euro-
pean goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and other
spice; and there he was not only paid his freight very"
Well, and at a very good price, but being not willing ,to

. , sell the ship then, the merchant furnished himwith goods
on his. own account; that for some money and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him,- he went
back to the Manillas, to the Spaniards, where he soldhis
cargo very well. Here, having gotten a good acquain-
tance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship; and
the governor of Manjlla hired him to go to Acapulco in
America, on the coast of Mexico; and gave him alicence
to land there, and travel to Mexico; and to pass in any
Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. :. .

' He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and

. there he sold his ship; and having there also obtained 91-- '
lowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found means,
some how or otherrto go to Jamaica with allhhis trea~
sure; and about eight years after came to England, .ex<
'ceedingly rich, of which I shall take notice in its place:

in the meantime, I return to our particular afi'airs.

' Being now to part with the ship and ship's company,
it came before us, of course, to consider whatrecompense
<<we should give to the two men that gave us such timely

. notice of the design against us in the river of Cambodia.

's The truth was, they had done us a considerable service,
and deserved well at our hands--though, by the way,
they were a couple of rogues too: for, as they believed
the story of our being pirates, and that we had really run
away with the ship, they came down to us, not only to
betray the design that was formed against us, but to goto

. sea with us as pirates; and one of them confessed after-
wards, that nothing else but the hopes of going a-rdguing
brought him to do it.. However, the service they did
us was not the less; and therefore as I had promised to
be grateful to them, I first ordered the money to be paid'
to them, which they said was due to them on board their
respective ships--that is to say, the Englishman nineteen
months' pay, and to the Dutchman seven; and, over and
'above that, I gave each of them a small sum of money in
gold, which contented them very well: then I made the
Englishman gunner of the ship, the gunner being now
made second mate and purser; 'the DutchmanImade boat- -,
swain ; so they were both very well pleased, and proved '
very serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout
fellows.

We were now on shore in China. If I thought myself
banished, and remote from my own country, at Bengal, k
where I had many ways to get home for my money, what

>> could I think of myself now, when I was gotten about a
thousand leagues farther off from home, and. perfectly -
destitute of all manner of prospect of retuml .

All we, had for it was this: that in about four months'
time there was to be another fair at that place where we
were, and then we might be able to purchase all sorts of ,
the manufactures of the country, and withal might pos-
sibly find some Chinese junks or vessels from Nanquin,
that would be to be sold, and would carry us and our _ .,
goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and re-
solved to wait ; besides, as our particular persons were not
obnbxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came thither,~
perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods,
and get passage to some other place inIndia nearer home.

. Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here; but,
- to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into
the country. First, we went ten days' journey to seecoupmrson or CHINESE wrrn EUROPEANS; ' 505

~_the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing, indeed:
; they say it has a million of people in it,'which, however,
a , g I do not believe; It is regularly built, the streets all
>> -' exactly- straight, and cross one another in direct lines,
which gives the figure of it great advantage.

But when I came to compare the miserable people of
these countries with ours--their fabrics, their manner of
living, their govcmment, their religion, their wealth, and '
their glory (as some call it), I must confess, I do not so
much as th1nk it worth naming, or worth my while to
write of, or any that shall come after me to read.

It' 1s very observable, that we wonder at the grandeur,
the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the government,
the manufactures, the commerce, and the conduct of
these people--not that they are to be wondered at, 'or,
' indeed, in the least to be regarded; but, because, having

first a notion of the barbarity of those countries, the rude-

ness and the ignorance that prevail there, we do not expect
to find any such things so far off.

=Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and

_ roy'al buildings of Europe? What their trade, to the \

universal commerce of Eng land, Holland, France, and

Spain? What their cities tgo ours, for wealth, strength,

gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an infinite variety '2

What are their ports, supplied with a few junksand

barks, to our navigation, our merchants' fleets, our large

and powerful navies? Our city of London has more
trade than all their mighty empire. Our English,'or

Dutch, or French man-of-war, of eighty guns, would

fight with and destroy all the shipping of China. But

the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power of
. their government, and strength of their armies, are sur-
prising to us, because, as I have said, considering them'
as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better than sav-
ages, we did not expect such things among them; and
this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their great-
; ness and power is represented to us; otherwise, it is in

. itself nothing at all: for, as I have said of their ships, so
(it may be said of their armies and troops-"all the forces
of their empire, though they were to bring two millions

of men into the field together, would be able to do- nothing
' but ruin the country, and starve themselves. If they
Were to besiege a strong town<<in Flanders, or to fight
a disciplined army, one line of German cuirassiers,
or of French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse '0!
China; a million of their foot could not stand before one
embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not. to be
surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty
in number--nay, I do not boast, if I say, that thirty thou-
sand German or English foot, and ten thousand French
horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China. And so
of our fortified towns, and of the art of our engineers,
in assaulting and defending towns: there is not afortified
town in China could hold out one month against the
batteries and attacks of an European army; and, at the
same time, all the armies of China could never take such
a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved--no, not
in ten years' siege. They have fire-arms,-it is'true, but
they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain of going ofi--
they have powder, but it is of no strength--theyhave
neither discipline in the field, exorcise in their arms,
sldll to attack, nor temper to retreat. And therefore, I
must confess, it seemed strange to me when I came home,
and heard our people say such fine things of the power,
riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of the Chinese,
because I saw and knew that they were a contemptible
herd or crowd' of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a
government qualified only to rule such a people; and, in
a word--for I am now launched quite beside my design
----I say, in a word, were not its distance inconceivably
great frem Muscovy, and were not the Muscovite empire
almost as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a crowd of
slaves as they, the Czar of Muscovy might, with much
ease, drive them all out of their country, and conquer
them in one campaign; and had the Czar, who, I since
hear, is a growing prince, and begins to appear formid-
able in the World, fallen this way, instead of attacking
the warlike Swedes (in which attempt none of the powers
of Europe would have envied or interrupted him), he
might, by this time, have been Emperor of China, in-'.'-.\3>> f ~ - j x

stead of being beaten by the king of Sweden at Narva, .

when the latter was not one to six in- number. As their

"strength and their grandeur, so their navigation, com-
merce, and husbandry, are imperfect and impotent, com-
pared to the same things, in Europe. Also, in their
knowledge, their learning, their skill in the sciences:
they have globes and spheres, and a smatch of the know-
ledge of the mathematics ; but when you: come to inquire
into their knowledge, how short-sighted are the wisest '
'of their students! They know nothing of the motion of *
the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, -
that when the sun is eclipsed, they think it is a great

. dragon has assaulted and run away with it, and they 'fall
a clattering with all the drums and kettles in the coun>>
try, 'to flight the monster away, just as we do to hive a
swarm of bees. - , '

As this is the only excursion of this kind which I have
made in all the account I have given of my travels, so I
shall make no more descriptions of countries and people: ,
it is none of my business, or any part of my design; but
giving an account of my own adventures through a life

' of infinite wanderings, and a long variety of changes,

. which, perhaps, few have heard the like of, I shall say
nothing of the mighty places, desert countries, and nu-

' merous people, I have yet to pass through, more than re-
lates to my own story, and which my concern among them
will make necessary. I was now, as nearas I can compute,

'in the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty degrees
"north of the line, for we were returning from N anquin ;

' I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I ,,
had heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned
me daily to do it. At length his time of going awa
being set, and the other missionary who was to go wi
him being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we
should resolve either to' go, or not to go: so I referred
him to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice,. who
at length resolved it in the afiirmative, and we prepared

--_ for our journey. We set out with very good advantage,

. , as to finding the way; for we got leave to travel in the

. their mandarins, a kind of Viceroy, or
principal magistrate, in the province where they reside,
' and who take great state upon them, travelling with
'great attendance, and with great homage from the peop ple,
who are sometimes greatly imp overished by them, be-
cause all the countries they pass through are obliged to
furnish provisions for them, and all their attendants.
That which I particularly observed, as to our travelling
with his baggage, was this: that though we received sufli-
cient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses, from
the cOuntry, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were
obliged to pay for everything we had after the market
price of the country, and the mandarin' s steward, or
commissary of the provisions, collected it duly from us;
so that our travelling in the retinue of the mandarin,
though it Was a very great kindness to us, was not such
a mighty favour in him, but was, indeed, a great ad-
vantage to him, considering there were about thirty other
people travelling' in the same manner besides us, under '
the protection of his retinue, or, as we may call it, under
. his convoy. This, I say, was of great advant agetohim;
for the country furnished all the provisions for nothing,
and he took all our money for them.

We were five- and- twenty days travelling to Pekin,
through a country infinitelyy populous, but miserably cul-
tivated: the husbandry, economy, and the way of living g,
all very miserable, though they boast so much of the
industry of the people--I say miserable; and so it is,
if we, who understand how to live, were to endure it, or
to compare it with our own; but not so to these poor
wretches, who know no other. The pride of these peop ple
is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their

po,verty which adds to that which I call their misery.
I must needs think the naked savages of America live
. much more happy, because, as they have nothing, so they
desire nothing; whereas, these are proud and insolent,
and, in the main, are mere beggars and drudg es; their os-
tentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly showed in their
clothes and buildin gs,- and in the keep ing multitudes of
servants or slaves, and, which is to the last degree ridi-
culous, their contempt 0" all the world but themselves.nascmrrrou or a cmsn GENTLEMA'N, 509

' I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards,
in the deserts and vast wildemesses of Grand Tartary,
than here: and yet the roads here are well paved and well
kept, and very convenient for travellers ; but nothing was
more awkward to 'me than to see such a haughty, im-
perious, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest'
simplicity and ignorance; for all their famed ingenuity
is no more) My friend, Father Simon, and I, used to be
very men'y upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride
' of those people. For example, coming by the house of
a country gentleman, as Father Simon called him, about
ten leagues ofi' fromrthe city of Nanquin, we had, first of
all, the honour to ride with the master of the house about
two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixot-
-ism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty.
The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a
scaramouch, or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with
all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, such as hang-
, ing sleeves, taffety, and cuts and slashes almost on every
side ; it covered a rich tafi'ety vest, as greasy as a butcher, '.
' and which testified, that his honour must needs be a most
exquisite sloven. ~, ~
His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature,
,'such as in England might sell for about thirty or forty
shillings; and he had two slaves following him on foot,
to drive the poor creature along: he had a whip in his
hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast about the head
as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode by us
with about ten or twelve servants, and we were told he
was going from the city to his country seat, about half'
a league before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure '
of a gentleman rode away before us; and we stopped at '
_ a village about an hour to refresh us, when we came by -
the country seat of this great man, we saw him in a little
place before his door, eating his repast; it was akind of
a garden, but he was easy to be seen; and we were given
to understand, that the more we looked on him, the better
he would be pleased. . '
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto tree,
which efiectually shaded ham over the head. and on the

Q
south side: but under the tree also was placed a large
umbrella, which made that part look well enough; he sat
lolling back' in a great elbow chair. being a heavy cor-
pulent man, and his meat being brought him by two
'women slaves; he had two more, whose ogifice I think, few
gentlemen" in Europe would accept of their service in,
namely, one fed the squire with a spoon, and the other
held the dish with one hqa,nd and sora pad 011' what he let
fall upon his worship's beard and taffety vest, with the
other; while the great fat brute thought it below him to
employ his own-hands in any of those familiar oflices,'
which kings and monarchs would rather do than be
troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.

I took this time to think what pain men's pride puts
them to, and how troublesome a haughty temper, thus .
ill managed, must be to a man of common sense; and,
leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our look-
ing at him, as if we admired his pom ,whereas we really

pitgied and contemned him, we pursue. our journey , only
Father Simon had the curiosity to stay, to inform him
self what dainties the country] ustice had to feed on,m
all his state, which, he said, he had the honour to taste
of, and which was, I think, a dose that an English hound
would scarce have eaten, if it had been oifered him.
V namely y, amess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlicin
' it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, and another
plant which they a'ghave there, something like our ginger.
but smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard--4111
this was put together, and a small lump or piece of lean
mutton boiled in it; and this was his worship's re ast,
four or five servants more attending at a distance. he
fed them meaner than he was fed himself, the spice ex-
cepted, they must fare very coarsely indeed.

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was
respected like a kin g---sur-rounded alway s with his gem
tleme'n, and attendegd, in all his appearances, with such
pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance; but this
I observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue, but
that our carriers' packhorses in England seem to me to '
look much better; but they were so covered with equiv" *: ARRIVAL u rum; *:':,. "511

page, mantles ,trappings, and such like trumpery, that you'
cannot see whether they are fat or lean. In a word, we '
could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads.
- ' I was now li ght- hearted, and all my trouble and per-
plexity that I hgad given an account of being over, I had
no anxious thoughts about me, which made thisj Journey
much the pleasanter to me; nor had I any ill accident
attended me, only in the passing or fording a ysmall river,
my horse fell, and made me free of the country, as they
call it--that is to say, threw me in; the place was not
deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it, because
it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the
names of several people and places which I had occasion
to remember, and which, not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be read,
to my great loss as to the names of some places which
I touched at in this vo yeag.

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me
but the youth, whom my nephew the captain had given '
me to attend me as a servant, and who proved very trusty
and diligent, and my partner had nobody with him but
one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese
pilot, he being desirous to see the court, we gave him his
passage, that is to say, bore his charges for his company,

' and to use him as an interpreter--for he understood the

language of the country, and spoke good French and a
little English; and, indeed, this old man was a most
useful implement to us everywhere; for we had not been
above a week at Pekin, when he came laughing ' "Ah.
Seignior Inglese," said he, "I have something to tell you '
will make your heart glad. " " My heart glad I" said I,
" What can that be 9 I don't know anything in this coun-
try can either give me joy or grief, in any great degree."
"Yes, yes," said the old man, in broken English, "make '
you glad, me sorrow"--sorry he would have said. This
made me more inquisitive. " Why," said I, "will it
make you Bony? " " Because," said he, "you have
brought me here twenty-five days' journey, and will leave

' - me to go back alone; and which way shall I get to my
. .port afterwards, without a- ship, without a horse, without .saturzfn-vrr'? Mr" *"3":'i'-"SSY~'Y=t' etch ' V-r Missy's,

pecune '2" so he called money, being his broken Latin, of f
which he had abundance to make us merry with. .1
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Mus-

covy and Polish merchants in the city, and that they were

' preparing to set out on their journey by land, to Mus---
covy, within'four or five weeks, and he was sure we would
take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him be-
hind to go back alone. I confess I was surprised with
this news: a secret joy spread itself over my whole'soul, '
which I cannot describe, and never felt before or since,
and, I had no poweryfor a good while, to speak a word to
the old man; but at last I turned to him. " How do you
know this?" said I; "are you sure it is true?" "Yes,"
he said, " I met this morning in the street an old acquaint-
ance of mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian,
who isamong them ; he came last from Astracan, and was
designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him,
but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go back
with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the, river of
Wolga to Astracan." " Well, Seignior," said I, " do not
be uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this be a
method for my return to England, it shall be your fault
if you go back to Macao at all." We then went to con-
sult together what was to be done, and I asked my partner
what he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would
suit with his affairs; .he toldme he would do just as I
would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal,
and left his effects in such good hands, that as we made
a good voyage here,-if he could invest it in China silks,
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the carriage,
he would be content to go to England, and then make
his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships.

 

 

CHAPTER XXXIv.

HAVING resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our'Portu- j
guese pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges
to Moscow, or to England, if be pleased: ,nor, indeed,SETS our WITH THE cmvm'ron EUROPE. 513

were we to be esteemed over-generous in that part neither,
if we had not rewarded him further ; for the service he had
done us was really worth all that, and more; for he had
not only-been a pilot to us at.sea, but he had been also
like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us the
Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our
pockets. So we consulted together about it; and, being
willing to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing him
justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides,
for he was a most necessary man on all occasions, we
agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I
compute it, came to about one hundred and seventy-five
pounds sterling between us, and to bear his charges; both
for himself and horse, except onlya horse to carry his goods.

Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to
let him know what we had resolved upon: I told him, he -
had complained of ourbeing like to let him go back alone,
and I was now to tell him we wereresolved he should not
go back at all--that, as we had resolved to go to Europe
with the caravan, we resolved also he should go with us,
and that we called him to know his mind. He shook his
head, and said it was a long journey, and he had no pe-
cune to carry him thither, nor to subsist himself when he
came thither. We told him, we believed it was so, and,
therefore, we had resolved to do something for him, that
should let him see how sensible we were of the service he
had done us, and also how agreeable he was to us: and
then I told himth we had resolved to give him, here,
which he'might lay out as we would do our own; and that
as for his charges, if he would go with us, we would set
him safe ashore lglife and casualties excepted), either in
Muscovy or in ngland, which he would, at our own
charge, except only the carriage of his goods. ' .,

He received the proposal like a man transported, and
told us he would go with us over the whole world ;, and so, .
in short, we all prepared ourselves for the j ourney- How-
ever, as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants
--they had many things to do ; and, instead of being ready
in. five weeks, it was four months and some odd days be-

_ fore all things were got together.

2:
It was the beginningof February, our style, when we
- set out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had
gone express back to the port where we had first put in,
to dispose of some goods which we had left there; and I,
with a Chinese merchant, whom I had some knowledge
of at Nanquin, and who came to Pekin on his own afi'airs,
went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine
damaSks, with about two hundred pieces of other fine silks
of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these
brought to Pekin against my partner'sreturn : besides this,
we bought a very large quantity of raw silk, and some other
goods ; our cargo amounting, in these goods only, to about
three thousand five hundred pounds sterling, which, to-
gether with tea, and some fine .calicoes, and three camel-
loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels
for our share, besides those we rode upon : which, with two
or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with provi-
sions, made us, in short, twenty-six camels andhorses in
our retinue. - -

The cempany was very great, and, as near as I can re-

member, made between three and four'hundred horses and '

camels; and upward of a hundred and twenty men, very
well armed, and provided for all events. For, as the eastern
caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are
these by the Tartars ; but they are not altogether so danger-
ous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations,

such as the Muscovites chiefly ;' for there'were about sixty '

of them who were merchants or inhabitants of Moscow,
though of them some were Livonians: and, to our parti-
cular satisfaction, five of them were Scots, who appeared
also to be men of great experience in business, and very
good Substance.'

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides,
who were five in number, called all the gentlemen and
merchants, that is to say, all the passengers, except the
servants, to a great council, as they termed it. At this
great council, every one deposited a certain quantity of
money to a common stock, for the necessary expense of
buying forage on the way. where it.Wa_s not otherwise toDESCRIPTION or A CHINESE HOUSE. 515

be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses, and

the like. And here they constituted the' Journey, as they

Called it, namely, they named captains and officers to

draw us all up, and give the command in case of an attack;

- and gave every one their turn of command. Nor was this
forming us into order any more than what we found need-
ful up on the way, as shall be observed in its place.'

The road all on this side of the country 15 very popu-
lous, and is full of potters and earthmakera--that 1s to
say, people that tempered the earth for the China ware ,
and, as I was going along, our Portuguese pilotrwho had
always something or other to say to make us merry, came
sneering to me, and told me, he would show the greatest '

rarity 1n all the country ;and that I should have this to
say of China, after all the ill-humoured things I had said
ofy it, that I had seen one thing which was not be seen in
all the world beside. I was very importunate to know
what it was; at last, he told me it was a gentleman's
house, built all with China ware. " Well," said I, " are not
the materials of their building the product of their own
country; and so it is all China ware, is it not. 9" "No,
no," says he, "I mean, it is a house all made of China
ware, such as you call so in En g;land or, as it 18 called
inour country, porcelain." "Well, " said I," suchathing
may be: how big' 1s it? can we carry it in a box upon a
camel? Ifwe can, we will buy i." " Upon a camel!"
said the old pilot, holding up both his hands; "why, there
is a family of thirty peoplep lives m i. " ,

I was then curious indeed to see it; and when I came
to see it, it was nothing but this--it was a timber house, or

"a house built, as we call it in England, with lath' and plas-
ter, but all the plastering was really China ware, that is to
say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China ware.

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed,
and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with
blue figures, as the large Chinaware inEngland is painted,
and hard as if it had been burnt. As to the inside, all
the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with hard and
painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley tiles
in England, all made of the finest China, and the figures
exceedingly fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of
colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one
figure, but joined so artificially with mortar, being made
of the same. earth, that it was very hard to see where the

tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the same com- .

position, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use
in "several parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Not-
tinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c., as hard as stone, and
smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller
rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with
the same tile: the ceiling, and, in-a word, all the plaster'
ing work in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but
9f a deep shining black.

This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and literally
to be called so; and had I not been upon the journey, I
could have staid some days to see and examine the par-
ticulars of it. They told me there were fountains and fish-
pondsinthe garden, all paved at the bottom and sides with
the same, and fine statues set up in rows on the walks,
entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may
be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel
in their accounts of it--for they told me such incredible
things of their performance in crockery-ware, for such it
is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be
true. One told me, in particular, of a workman that made
a ship, with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthen-
ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he had told me
he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it, I might
have said something to it indeed; but as it was, I knew
the whole story, which was; in short, asking pardon for
the word, that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and said nothing
to it. , '

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan,
for which the leader of it for the day fined me about the
value of three shillings; and told me, if it had been three
days' journey without the wall, as it was three days' within,
he must have fined me four times as much, and made me
ask pardon the next council day : 'so I promised to be more

orderly; _for, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made
for keeping all together were absolutely necessary for our
common safety. , '

In two days more we passed the Great China Wall, made
' for a fortification against the Tartars ; and a very great
work it is, going over hills and'mountains in an endless
track, where the rocks are impassable, and the precipices
such as no enemy could possibly enter, or, indeed, climb
up, or where, if they did, no wall could hinder them. They
tell us, its length is near athousand English miles,but that
the country is five hundred, in a straight measured line,
which'the wall bounds, without measuring the windings
and turnings it takes: it is about four fathoms high, and
as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour or thereabouts, without trespass-
ing on our orders, for so long the caravan was in passing
the gate--I say, I stood still an hour to look at it, on
every side, near and far 01f ; Imean what was within my
view; and the guide of our caravan, who had been ex-
tolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager
to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a most ex-
cellent thing to keep ofl the Tartars, which he happened
not to understand as I meant it, and so took it fora com-
pliment: but the old pilot laughed: " O Seignior Inglese,"
said he, "you speak in colours." "In colours I " said I,
".what do you mean by that ? " " Why, you speak what
looks white this way, and black that way--gay one way,
and dull another way: you tell him it is a good wall to
keep out Tartars: you tell me by that, it is good for no-
thing but to keep out Tartars; or, will keep outnone but
Tartars. I understand you, Seignior Inglese,'I under-
stand you," said he, joking; "but Seignior Chinese un-
derstand you his own way."

u " Well," said I, " seignior, do you think it would stand

out an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of miners ?
Would they not batter it down in ten days, that an army
might enterin battalia, or blowit up in the air, foundation
and all, that there should be no sign of it left ?" " Ay, ay,"
said he, " I know that." The Chinese wanted mightily to
know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few
days after, for we were tghen almost out of their country,
and he was to leave us in a little time afterwards; but
when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest
of the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the
Chinese power and greatness while he staid.

' After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a wall,
something like the Picts' wall, so famous in Northumber-
land, and built by the Romans, we began to find the coun-
try thinly inhabited, and the people rather confined to
live in fortified towns and cities, as being subject to the
inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great
armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked
inhabitants of an open country.

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping to-
gether in a caravan, as we travelled, for we saw several
troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see
them distinctly, I wondered how that the Chinese empire
could be conquered by such contemptible fellows; for
they are a mere herd or crowd of wild fellows, keeping no
order, and understanding no discipline, or manner of fight.

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught
nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this was found the
first day we saw them, which was after we entered the
wilder part of the country. Our leader for the day gave
leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, as they call
it; and what was this but hunting of sheep I However,
it may be called hunting too; for the creatures are the
wildest and swiftest of foot that everI saw of their kind;
only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase; for they appear gener-

ally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, al-'

ways keep together when they fly.

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to
meet with about forty Tartars: whether they were hunt-
ing mutton, as we were, or whether they looked for an-
other kind of prey, I know not ; but as soon as they saw
us, one of them blew a kind of horn very loud, but with
a barbarous sound that I had' never heard before, and,
by the way. never care to hear again. We all supposed
urscxan BY A near or mamas. 519

this was to call their friends about them; and lo it was ;
for in less than half a quarter of an hour, a troop of forty
or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance; but our
work was over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be
amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn, he told
us, in short, that we had nothing todo but to charge them!
immediately, without loss of time; and, drawing us up
in a line, he asked if we were resolved? We told him
we were ready to follow him; so he rode directly up~to
them. They stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn
up in no order, nor showing the face of any order. at all;
but as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their
arrows ; which, however, missed us very happily: it seems
they mistook not their aim, but their distance: for their
arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim,
that had we been about twenty yards nearer, we must
have had several men wounded, if not killed.

Immediately we halted; and though it was at a great
distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden
arrows, following our shot full gallop,resolving to fall in
among them sword in hand; for so' our bold Scot that
led us directed. ~He was, indeed, but a merchant, but he '
behaved with that vigour and bravery on this occasion,
and yet. with such a cool courage too, that I never saw

. any man in action fitter for command. . As soon as we

came up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and
then drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion imu
aginable ; the only stand any of them made, was on our
right, where three of them stood, and by signs called the
rest to come back to them, having a kind of scymitar in
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs. Our
brave commander, without asking anybody to follow him,
galloped up close to them, and with his fusil knocked one
of them off his horse, killed the second with his pistol;
and the third ran away--and thus ended our fight; but
we had this misfortune attending it, namely, that all our
mutton that we had in chase got away. We had not a man
killed or hurt; but,_as for the Tartars, tnere were about

_ five of them killed--how many were wounded we knewt

not ; but this we knew, that the other party was so frighted
with the noise of our guns, that they fled, and never made
any attempt upon us. '

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and
therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but,
in about five days, we entered a vast great. wild desert,
which held us three days' and nights' march: and we were
obligedto carry ourwater with us in great leather bottles,
and to encanfrp all night, just as I have heard they doin
the deserts of Arabia.

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in ? and they
told me this was a kind of border that might be called No
Man's Land, being part of the Great Karakathy, or Grand
Tartary, but that, however, it was reckoned to China ; that
there was no care taken here to preserve it from the in-

roads of thieves; and therefore it was reckoned the worst

desert in the whole march, though we were to go over
some much larger. r _

In passing the wilderness, which, I confess, was at the
first view very frightful to me, we saw two or three times

little parties of the Tar-tars, but they seemed to be upon .

their own afi'airs, and to have no design upon us; and so,
' like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to
say to us, we had nothing to say to them: we let them go.

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand
and gaze at us, whether it was to consider what they should
do, namely, to attack us or not to attack us, we knew not ;
but when we were passed at some distance by them, we
made a rear-guard of forty men, and stood ready for them,
letting the caravan pass half a mile or tnereabouts before
us. After a while they marched ofi', only we found they
assaulted us with five arrows at their parting, one of which
wounded a horse'so that it disabled him; and we left him
the next day, poor creature, in great need of a good farrier.
We suppose they might shoot more arrows, which might
fall short of us; but we saw no more arrows, or Tartars,
at that time.

We travelled near a month after this, the ways being
not so good as at first, though still in the dominions of the
emperor of China, but lay, for the most part, in villages.

some of which were fortified, because of the incursions of
the Tartars. When we came to one of these towns (it was
about two and a half days' journey before we were to come
to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of which
there were plenty to be sold all the way upon that road,
and of horses also, such as they are, because so many
caravans coming that way, they are very often wanted.
The person that I spoke to get me a camel, would have
gone and fetched it for me; but I, like a fool, must be
oflicious, and go myself along with him. The place was
about two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they
kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company, and
a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of a little variety.
When we came to this place, it was a low marshy ground,
walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, without mor-
tar or earth among it, like a park, with a little guard of
Chinese soldiers at the doors. Having bought a 'camel,
and agreed for the price, I came away; and the Chinese
man that went with me led the camel, when on a sudden
came up five Tar-tars on horseback: two of them seized the
fellow, and took the camel from him,whi1e the other three
stepped up to me and my pilot; seeing us, as we were, un-
armed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword,
which could but ill defend me against three horsemen.
The first that came up stopped short upon my drawing my
sword (for they are arrant cowards ; but a second coming
upon my left, gave me a blow on the ead, which I never felt

- till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to myself, what

was the matter with me, and where I was, for he laid me
flat on the ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Por-
tuguese (so Providence, unlooked-for, directs deliverances
frOm dangers which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol
in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars
neither: if they had, I suppose they would not have
attacked us; but cowards are always boldest whenthere
is no danger. :7 , "'-"- '
The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped -

up to the fellow that had struck me, and laying hold {of
his arm with one hand, and pulling him down by mainv.--\----v ' - - v--wrciflvw . , -

force a little towards him with the other, he shot him into
the head, and laidhim dead on the spot; he then immedi-
ately stepped up to him who had sptopped us, as I said,
and before he could come forward again (for it was all done,
as it were, in a moment), made a blow at him with a
scymitar, which he always wore, but, missing the man,
out his horse into the side of his head, out one gof his ears
ofi' by the reot, and a great slice down the side of his face.
The poor beast, enraged with the wounds, was no more to
be governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough
too, but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the

pilot's reach; yand, at some distance, rising upon his hind
legs ,threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him.

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however, seeing
the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him, he runs
to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he
had by his side,. something like a pol-e -axe, but not a
pole- axe either, he wrenched it from him, and made shift
to knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old
man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and, seeing

he did not fly as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as

he a pprehended, but stood stock still, the oldg man stood
still too, and falls to work with his tackle to charge his pis-
tol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, whether
he supposed it to be the same or anotherI know not, but
awayhe secured, and left my pilot, my champion I called
him afterwards, a complete victory.

By this time I was a little awake; for I thou g,ht when

I first beg an to awake, that I had been' in a sweet sleep; v

but as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came
up on the ground, and what was the matter: in a word
a few minutes after, as sense returned, I felt pain, though
I did not know where; I clapped my hand to my head,
and took it away bloody; then I felt my head'ache, and
then, in another moment, memory returned, and every-
thing was present to me again.

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold or
my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a Tartar lying
dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him, and,

looking farther, I saw my champion and deliverer, who
had been to see what the Chineselhad done, coming back
with his hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing me on
.my feet, came running-to me and embraced me with a.
great deal of joy, being afraid before that I had been killed,
and, seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt--butait
was not much, only what we call a broken head ; neither
' did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the
blow, other than the place which was hurt, and which was-
well again in two or three days. . '- .
'.-_. ~We made no great gain, however, by this victory; for
we lost a camel, and gained a horse: but that which was
remarkable, when we came back to the village, the man
demanded to be paid for the camel. I disputed it, and it ~
f was brought to a hearing before the Chinese judge of the
place; that is to say, in English, we went before a justice
of the peace. Give him his due, he acted with a great deal
of prudence and impartiality ; and having heard both sides,
he gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me to
buy the camel, whose servant he was ?--'-" I am no ser-
vant," said he, " but went with the stranger." " At whose
request '2" said the justice. "At the stranger's request,"
said he. "Why, then," said the justice, "you were the
stranger's servant for the time; and the camel being deliv-
ered to his servant, it was delivered to him, and he must
pay for it." '

g I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not. aword
.to say; but admiring'to see such just reasoning upon the
consequence, and so . accurate stating the case, I paid
willingly for the camel, and sent'foru another; but you
may observe, I sent for it; I did not go to fetch it myself
any more--I had had enough of that. ' .

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire:

they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there;
for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in
Karakathy, which, I behave, are some millions, could not
batter down the walls with their bows and arrows; but to
call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon, would be
to make those who understand it laugh at you.

, ,. We wanted, as I have said, about two days' journey
of this city, when messengers were sent express to every-
part of the road, to tell all travellers and caravans to halt,
till they had a guard sent to them; for that an unusual
body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all, had appeared
in the way, about thirty miles beyond the city. .
This was very bad news to travellers: however, it was
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad to
hear we should have a guard. Accordingly, two days
after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a gar-
rison of the Chinese on our left, and'three hundred more
from the city of N aum, and with those we advanced boldly;
the three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our
front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men on each
side of our camels with our baggage, and the whole cara-

van in our centre. In this order, and well prepared for '

battle, 'we thought ourselves a match for the whole ten
thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another thing.

'It' was early in the morning. when, marching from a
little well-situated town, called Changu, we had a river
to pass, where we were obliged to ferry: and had the
Tar-tars had any intelligence, then had been the time to
have attacked us, when, the caravan being over, the rear-
guard was behind: but they did not appear there.

About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by
a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was at
hand; and they were at hand indeed, for they came on
upon the spur. "

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked
so big the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers
frequently looked behind them, which is a certain sign
in a soldier that he is just ready to run away. My old
pilot was of my mind; and being near me, he called out:
" Seignior Inglese," said he, "those fellows must be en-
couraged,'or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars come
on, they will never stand it." " I am of your mind," said
I; "but what course must be done '9" "Done ?" said he;
"let fifty of our men advance,'and flank them on each
wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like brave

fellows in brave company ; but without it, they will every-

man turn his back." Immediately I rode up to our leader.3 '29-," --' r' ,-

ENGAGEMENT WITH rmrms. ' 525

and told him, who was exactly of our mind; and accord-
ingly, fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the
left, and the rest made a line of reserve ; for so we marched,
leaving the last two hundred men to make another body to
themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need
were,they should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
company they were; how many we could not tell, but ten
thousand, we thought, was the least. . A party of them
came on first, and viewed our posture, traversing the
ground in the front of our line; and as we found them
within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two wings to ad-
vance swiftly and give them a salvo on each wing with their
shot, which was done; but they went ofl', and, I suppose,
went back to give an account of the reception they were
like to meet with: and, indeed, that salute clogged their
stomachs; for they immediately halted, stood a while to
consider of it, and, wheeling off to the left, they gave
over the design, and said no more to us for that time;
which was agreeable to our circumstances,which were but
very indifferent for a battle with such a number.

CHAPTER 'XXXV.

- Two days after this.we came to the city of Naum, or

Naumn. We thanked the governor for his care for us,
and collected to the value of one hundred crowns, or
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard
us; and here we rested one day. This is a garrison, in-
deed, and there were, nine hundred soldiers kept here;
but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the Mus-
covites having abandoned that part of the country
(which lies from the city west, for about two-hundred
miles), as desolate and unfit for use, and more especially,
being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops
hither for its defence; for we had yet above two thousand

miles to Muscovy, properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two dread-
ful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days in passing
over, and which, as I said, was to be called No Man's
Land; and, on the 13th of April, we came to the fron-
tiers of the Muscovite dominion's. I think the first city,
or town. or fortress, whatever it might be called, that
belong ed to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being
on the west side' of the river Argu n.

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction, that
1 was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country,
or, at least, in a country governed by Christians; for
though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, but just de-
serve gthe name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be,
and are very devout in their way. It would certainly
occur to any man who travels the world as I have doney,
and who had any ypower of reflection--I say y, it would
occur to him, to reflect, what a blessing it is to be brought
Into the world where the name of God, and of a Redeemer,
is known, worshipped, and adored--and not where the
people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions, worship

he devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones
--worship monsters, elements, horribly shaped animals,
and statues, or images of monsters. Not a town or city
we passed through but had their p,agods their idols, and
their temples; and ignorant people worshipping even the
works of their own hands I

Now we came where at least, a face of the Christian
worship appeared, where the knee was bowed to Jesus ,
and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion
was owned, and the name of the true God was called
upon and adored; and it made the very recesses of my
soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots merchant
I mentioned above, with my first acknowledgment of this,
and, taking him by. the hand, I said to himgm "Blessed be
God, we are once again come among Christians 1 " He
smiled, and answered," Do not rejoice too soon, country-
man; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians:
and but for the name of it, you may see very little of the
substance for some months farther of our journey."

" Well, said I, "but still it is better than paganism,"firm-.." .... "mm..." . ,. ,

and worshipping of devils." " Why, I'll tell you," said
he, " except the Russian soldiers in garrisons, and a few
of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the
rest of this country, for above a thousand miles farther,
is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans."
And so indeed we found it.

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid
earth, if I understand anything of the surface of the
globe, that is to be found in any part of the world: we
had at least twelve hundred miles to the sea, eastward;
we had at least two thousand to the bottom of the Baltic
Sea, westward; and almost three thousand miles, if We
left that sea and went on west to the British and French
channels; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian,
or Persian Sea, south; and about eight hundred miles to
the Frozen Sea, north--nay, if some people may be be-
lieved, there might be no sea north-east till we came
round the pole, and, consequently, into the north-west,
and so had a continent of land into America, no mortal
knows where; though I could give somereasonswhy I
believe that to be a mistake too. \

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a good
while before we came to any considerable town, we had

, nothing to observe there but this--first, that all the

rivers ran to the east. As I understood by the charts
which some of our caravans had with them, it was plain
that all those rivers ran into the great river Yamour, or

- Gammour. This riverfby the natural course of it, must

run into the East Bea, or Chinese Ocean. The story
they tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked up
with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, namely, three feet
about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed
to say I believe nothing of; but as its navigation is of no
use, because there is no trade that way, the Tartars, to
whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle, so
nobody that ever I heard of, has been curious- enough
either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or to come
from the mouth of it in ships; but this is certain, that
this river running due east, in the latitude of sixty de-
grees, carries a vast concourse of rivers along with it,
and finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude; so
we are sure of sea there. _

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several
considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as
the Yamour runs east; and these are all found to join
their waters with the great river Tartarus, named so from
the northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartars, who, the
Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the world; and who,
as our geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog men-
tioned'in sacred history.

These rivers running all northward, as well as all the
other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evident that the
Northern Ocean bounds the land also on that side ; so that
it does not seem rational in the least to think that the
land can extend itself to join with America on that side,
or that there is not a communication between the Northern
and the Eastern Ocean: but of this I shall say no more;
it was my observation at that time, and therefore I take
notice of it in this place. We now advanced from the
river Argun by easy and moderate joumeys,>>and were very
visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Muscovy has taken
to have cities and towns built in as many places as are
possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison,
sbmething like the stationary soldiers placed by the R0-
mans in the remotest countries of their empire, some of
which, I had read, were particularly placed in Britain for
the security of commerce, and for the lodging of travel-
lers; and thus it was here ; ' though wherever we came at
these towns and stations, the garrisons and governor were '
Russians, and professed mere pagans, sacrificing to idols,
and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host
of heaven: and not only so, but were, of all the heathens
and pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, ex-
cept only that they did not eat man's flesh, as our savages
of America did. .

Some instances of this we met with in the country,
between Argun, where we enter the Muscovite dominions,
and a city of Tartars and Russians together, called Nert-
sinskay; in which space is a continued desert or forest,

which cost us twenty days to travel over it. In a villagenear the last of thoseplaces? I had the curiosity to go and

' -' there stood out upon an old stump of a tree an idol made

" of wood, frightful as the devil, at least as anything we can

think of to represent the devil that can be made. It had

a head certainly not so much as resembling any creature

that the world ever saw--ears as big as goat's horns, and

I as high--eyes as big as a rown-pieee, and a nose like a

_. ; crooked ram's horn--an a mouth extended four-con-
. nered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like

a parrot's under the bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest '

manner that you can suppose: its upper garment was of-

, sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet

' on the head, with two horns growing through it :: it was.

about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other

1 - proportion of parts. . '-

,- This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the village ;
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seven:
teen creatures, whether men or women I could not tell,
for they make no distinction by their habits, either of body
or head; these lay all flat on the ground, round this for-

' 'midable block of shapeless wood. I saw no motion among
them any more than if they had been logs of wood, like
their idol--vat first I really thought they had been so ; but
whenI came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet,
and raised a howling cry, as if it had been so many deep:
mouthed hounds, and walked away as if they werediss
pleased at our disturbing them. A little way off from this '
monster, and at the door of a tent or hut made all of
sheep-skins and cow-skins; dried, stood three butchers: I
thought they were such ; for when I came nearer to them,
I found they had long knives in their hands, and in the
middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one

'. young bullock or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to
that senseless log of an idol, and these three men priest:

belonging to it; and the seventeen prostrated wretches _

were the people who, brought the ofiering, and were mak

ing their prayers to that stock. - -. u . 1 ,

brutish worship of a hobg oblin', than ever' I was at any
thing in my life--to see God's most glorious and best crea-
ture, to whom he had granted so many advantages, even

by creation, above thegr rest of the works of his hands, "

vested with a reasonable soul, and that soul adorned with
faculties and capacities adapted both to honour his Maker
and be honoured by him--I say, to see it sunk and de-
generated to a degree so more than stupid, as to prostrate
itselfto a fi'ig htful nothing,a mere imaginary object dressed
. up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their
own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags--and
that this should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought
up into hellish devotion by the devil himself, who, envying
his Maker the homag e and adoration of his creatures, had
deluded them into such gross, surfeiting, sordid, and brut-
ieh things gs, as one would think would shock nature itself.
But what signified all the astonishment and reflection
of thoughts ? Thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes ,
and there was no room to wonder at it, or think it im
possible. All my admiration turned to rage, and I rode
up to the image or monster, call it what you will, and

with my sword cut the bonnet that was on its head 1n '

two? in the middle, so that it hung down by one of the
' horns; and one of our men that was with me, took hold

, of the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it, when,
behold, a most hideous outcry and howling ran through

the village, and two or three hundred people came about '

my ears, so that I was glad to scour for it, for we saw
some had bows and arrows, but I resolved, from that mo-
ment, to visit them again.

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was
about four miles ofi, in order to gprovide some horses, which
they wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and
jaded with the badness of the'way', and our long march
over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put

my design in execution. I communciated my project to '

the Scots merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had
had a sufficient testimony, as above. I told him what I
had seen, and with what indignation I had since thought

that human nature could be so gndegenerate. I told him I _

was resolved, if I could get but four or five men well armed
to go with me, to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol;
2} to let them see that it had no power to help itself, and, '
A consequently, could not be' an object of worship, or to be
-- prayed to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it.
'7' {.4 He laughed at me: said he, "Your zeal may be good;
.'i but what do you propose to yourself by it ?" " Propose 1'?
a ' said I; "' to vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted
= by this devil-worship." \ .
r. - 7" " But how willit vindicate the honour of God," said he,
'" while the people will not be able to know what you mean
.,.by it, unless you could speak to them too, and tell them '
so? and then they will fight you too, I will assure you,
for they are desperate fellows, and that especially in de-
fence of their idolatry." ' "Can we not," said I, " do it
in the night, and then leave them the reasons in writing,
in their own language." " Writing 1" said he; "why,
there is not in five nations of them one man that knows
anything of a letter, or how to read a word in any lan-
guage, or in their own." " Wretched ignorance I" said I
to him: "however, I have a great mind'to do it; perhaps
nature may draw inferences fi'om it. to them, to let them
see how brutish they are to worship such horrid things."
"Look you, sir," said he: "if your zeal prompts you to
it so warmly, you must do it ; but in the next place, Iwould
have you consider these wild nations of people are subjected
by force to the Czar of Muscovy's dominion ; and if you
do this, it iskten to one but they will come by thousands -
to the governor of Nertzinskay, and complain, and de- '
mand satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, -
-' it is ten to one but they revolt; and it will occasion a new , 4 '
war with all the Tartars in the country." ' - '_ '
- -' This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a
while, but I harped upon the same string still; and all ,
that day I was uneasy to put my project in execution; '
Towards the evening the Scots merchant met me by
accident in our walk about the town, and desired to speak '
with me. ='~' I believe," said he, "I have put you ofi' your
' good design; I have been a little concerned about it . .
since; for I abhor the idol and idolatry as much as you , , -'
can do." " Truly," said I, " you have put it of!" a little,
as to the execution of it, but you have-not put it all out
of my thoughts; and, I believe, I shall do it still before

I quit this place, though I were to be delivered up ta- '

them for satisfaction." " No', no," said he, " God for-

bid they should deliver you up to such a crew of monsters l '

they shall, not do that neither; that would be murder~
ing you indeed." " Why," said I, "how would they use

me ?" "Use you!" said he; "I'll tell you how they .

served a poor Russian, who afironted them in their wor-
ship just as you did, and whom they took prisoner, after
they had lamed him with an arrow, that he could not
' run away: they took him and stripped him stark naked,
and set him upon the top of the idol monster, and stood
' all round him, and shot as many arrows into him as would
stick over his whole body; and then they burnt him, and
all the arrows sticking in him, as a sacrifice to the idol."-
' "And was'this the same idol?" said I. "Yes," said he,
"thevery'same." "Well," saidI, " Iwilltellyou a story."
So I related the story of our men at Madagascar, and
how they burnt and sacked the village there, and killed
man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of our
men, just as it it is related before ; and when I had done, I
added, that I thought we ought to do so to this village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when I
talked of doing so to that village, said he, "You mistake
very much; it was not this village; it was almost a hun-
dred miles from this place; but it was the same idol, for
they carry him about in procession all over the country."
" Well," said I, " then that idol ought to be punished for
it; and it shall," said I, "if I live this night out."
_ In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design,
and told' me, I should not go alone, but he would go
with me; but he would go first, and bring a stout-fellow,
one of his countrymen, to go also with us; " and one,"
said he, " as famous for his zeal as you can desire any
one to be against such devilish things as these." In a
word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom

he called Captain Richardson; and I gave him a full '
account of what I had seen, and also what I intended; '

' indeed, proposed 'it to my partner, but he declined it.

He said, he>> was ready to assist me to the utmost, and

, adventure .quite out of his way: so, I say, we resolved
, - upon our work, only we hree, and my man-serVant, and

to put it in execution t at night about midnight, with
all the secrecy imaginable. -

" However; upon second thoughts, we were willing to
delay it till the next night, because the caravan being to
set forward in the morning, we supposed the governm-

could not pretend to give them any satisfaction-upon us-

when we were out of lns power. The Scots merchant,
as steady in his resolution to enterprise it as bold in exe-
cuting, brought me a Tartar's robe, or gown of sheep
skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had pro-
vided the same for himself and his countryman, that the
people, if they saw us, should not be able to determine
who we were. , . ' " '

i' All the first night We spent in mixing up some combus-

tible matter with aquavitae, gunpowder, and such other -

materials as we could get ;' "and having a good quantity:
of tar in a little pot, about an hour after night we set out
upon our expedition. ' * 7 ,. ., In>>.
'4- We'came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and
found that the people had not the least jealousy of danger

attending their idol. The night was cloudy; yet the moon '

gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the

same posture and place that it did before. 2;. The people

seemed to be all at their rest; only, that in the great'hut
or tent, as we called it, where we saw, the three' priests-

whom we mistook forbutchers, we saw a light, and, going-

up close' to the door, we heard people talking, as if there

were five or six of them grwe concluded, therefore, 'that if-

we set wildfire" to the idol, these men would come out imi;
mediately and run up to the place to rescue-it from the
destruction that we intended for it ;>> and what to do with
them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away,

I. and setting fire to it at a'distance, but, when we came to

handle it, we found it too bulky for our carriage; So we 1, ,
were at loss again. The second Scotsman was for setting; ' '
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures that. "
were there on the head, when they came out; but I could ~
not' Join with that--I was against killing them, if it was:
possible to be avoided. "Well, then,~"g said the Scots

merchant," I will tell you what we will do; we willtry

to make them prisoners, tie their hands, and make them ', .

stand and see their idol destroyed."

'ZAS it happened, we had twine or packthread enough

about us, which we used to tie our fireworks tog ether with;

so we resolved to attack these peop ple first, and with as, 1

little noise as we could. The first thing we did we knocked
at the door, when one of the priests coming to it, we im-
mediately seized up on him, stopped his mouth, and tied
hishands behind him, and led him to the idol, where we

agged him, that he might not make a noise, tied his feet

alsog together, and left him on the gr.ound _,

Two gof us then waited at the door, expecting that:

another would come out to see what the matter was; but
we waited so long till the third man came back to us, and
then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently, and

immediately out came two more, and we served them] 'ust.
in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with thJem,

'.and lay them down by the idol some distance from one
another, when going back we found two more were come

out to the door, and a third stood behind them within the
door.: We seized the two, and immediately tied them,.
when the third stepp ping back, and crying out, my Scots,

merchant went 1n after him, and taldng out a composi-
' tion we had made, that would only smoke and stink, he
set fire to it, and threw it 1n among them: by that time
the other Scotsman and my man taking charge of the two
men already bound, and tied tog ether also by the arm, led

them away 37to the idol, and leftg them there,y to see if their '

idol would relieve them, making haste back to us. 5
When the furze we had thrown 1n had filled the hut

with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated, we

then threw in a small leather bag of another kind, which

flamed like a candle, and following it in we found there ' 'We <tnycd by it a quarter of an hour. or thereahouts. til] the

were but four people left, who, it seems, were two men
and two women, and, as we suppose, had been about
some of their diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short,
- ,frighted to death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid,
and not able to speak neither, for the smoke.
' _ In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the .
others, and all without any noise. . I shOuld have said,
we brought them out of the house, or hut, first ; for indeed,
we were not able to bear'the smoke any more than they
were. When we had done this, we carried them altogether
to the idol: when we came there we fell to work with

' , him; and first, we daubed him all over, and his robes also,

with tar, and such other stufi' as we had, which was tal-
low mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and
ears, and mouth full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up
a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then sticking
all the combustibles We had brought with us upon him,
' we looked about to see if we could findanything else to
help to burn him; when my Scotsman remembered that
by the tent,'or hut, where the men were, there lay a heap
of dry forage, whether straw or rushes I do not remember:
away he and the other Scotsman ran, and fetchedtheir
arms full of that>> When we had done this, we took a]
'- our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their fee
and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and
set them just before their monstrous idol, and then set fire

-; We staid by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till ' ~
the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol
blew up, and, as we could perceive, had split and deformed
the shape of it--and, in a word, till we saw it burnt into
a mere block or log of wood--and then, setting the dry for-

- age to it, we found it would be soon quite consumed-rec
We began to think of going away; but the Scotsman said,
" No, we must not go, for these poor deluded wretches will -

all throw themselves into the fire and burn themselves with
the idol." So we resolved to stay till the forage was burnt ,
down too,'and then we came away and left them,'

In the morning we appeared among our fellow-travel-
lers. exceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey;

\
nor could any man suggest that We had been anywhere but
in our beds, as travellers might be supposed to be, to fit
themselves for the fatigues of that day' s journey.

'But it did not end so; for the next day came a great
multitude of the country people, not onlyy of this village,
but of a hundred more, for aught I know, to the town gates ,
and, in a most outrageous manner, demanded satisfaction
of the Russian governor, for the insulting their priests,
and burning their great Cham- Chi-Thaungu gu; such a hard
name theyg gave the monstrous creature they worship.
The ppeo 16 of Nertzinskay were at first in a great conster+

nation; for they said the Tartars were no less than thirty
thousand, and that, in a few days more they would be one
>> hundred thousand stronger.

The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease
them, and gave them all the good words imagm able. He

. assured them he knew nothing of it, and that there had not
a soul of his garrisou been abroad, that it could not be
from any body there; and if they would let him know who
it was, he should be exem plarilyp unished. They returned
hau ghtily, that allthe country reverenced the great Cham-
Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt 1n the sun, and no mortal would
have dared to ofl'er violence to his' image but some Chris-
tian miscreants, so they called them, 1t seems; and they
therefore denounced war yagainst him, and all the Russians.
who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.

The governor still patient, and unwilling to make a
breach, or to have any cause of war alleged tog be given by
him, the Czar having strictly charged him to treat the con-
quered country with gentleness and civility y,gave them
still all the good wordgs he could. At last he told them;
there was a caravan gone towards Russia that morning,
and perhaps it was some of them who had done them this
in'ury;' and that, if they would be satisfied with that, he
would send after them, to inquire into it. This seemed
to appease them a little ; and accordingly the govemer sent
after us, and gave us a particular account how the thing.
was, intimating withal, that if anyin our caravan had done
it, they should make their escape; but that, whether they
had done it or no, we should make all the haste forwardat THE CARAVAN runsunn ,ar HORSEMENy; 537

that was possible; and that, in the meantime, he would
keep them in play aslong as. he could.

<9; This was very friendly in the governor. However, when
. it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything
of the matter; and, as for us that were guilty, we were the
_ least of all suspected: none so much as asked us the ques-
tion; however, the captain of the caravan, for the time,
took the hint that the governor gave us, and we marched
or travelled two days and two nights without any con-
siderable stop, and then we lay at a village called Plothus ;
, ; - nor .did we make any long stop here, but hastened on
T 3 towards J arawena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colo-
nies, and where we expected we should be safe; but it is

a to be observed, that here we began, for two or three days'
march, to enter upon a vast nameless desert, of which I

shall say more in its place ; and which, if we had now been

upon it, it is more than probable we had been all destroyed.

It was the second day's march from Plothus, that by the
clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some of our
people began to be sensible that we were pursued; we had
entered the desert, and had passed by a great lake, called
Schanks .Osier, when we perceived a very great body of '

horse appear on the other side of the lake to the north, we
travelling west.: - We observed they went away west, as we ,

did ; but had supposed that we should have taken that side

of the lake, whereas we very happily took the south side; ,7"

and in two days more we saw them not, for they, believing
We were still before them, pushed on till they came to the ' -_.-
river Udda ; this is a very great river when it passes farther ' ' 7
north, but when we came to it, We foundit narrow and "
fordable. . . , _, ,
The third day they either found their mistake,--or had
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards
the dusk of the evening. .We had, to our great satisfac
tion, just pitched upon a place for our camp, which was
very convenient for the night ; for as we were upon a desert,
' though but at the beginning of it, that was about five hun-
dred miles over, we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed,
=expected none but the city of J arawena, which we had
yet two days' march to ; the desert, however, had some few: Woods in it on this side, 'and little rivers, which ran all into'
the great river Udda.' It was in a narrow strait, between
two small but very thick woods, that we pitched our little
camp for that night, expecting to be attacked in the night.

I '<<* -> Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for ;.
lmt as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in 7
troop s in the desert, so the caravans always fortify them-
selves every night against them as against armies of rob~ .

'bers; and it was therefore no new thing to be p.ursued '

'But we-had this night, of all the nights of our 1)travels,

a most advantageouscamp ; for we lay between two woods, ~

with a little rivulet running just'before our front, so that ,

we could not be surrounded or attacked any way but in
, our front or rear: we took care also to make our front as

strong as we could, by placing our packs, with our camels
and horses, all in a line on the side of the river, and we

Afelled some trees' in our rear.

In thisp osture we encamped for the night; but the enemy
was upon us before we had finished our situation: they
did not come on us like thieves, as we expecteed, but sent
three messengers to us, to demand the men to be delivered
to them that had abused their priests, and burnt their god
Cham- Chi- Thaungu ,that theymig ht burn them with fire ,
and, upon this, they said, they would go away ,and do us
no further harm, otherwise they- would burny us all with

' fire. Our men looked very blank at this message, and
began to stare at one another, to see who looked with most
guilt in their faces ; but nobody was the word; nobody did
it. The leader of the caravan sent word, he was well as-
sured it was not done by any of our camp , that we were
peaceable merchants, travelling on our business, that we ,
had done no harm to them, or to any one else, and there- ;
fore they must look further for their enemies, who had in- '
jured them, for we were not the people; so desired them
not to disturb us, for if they did,p we I)sliould defend our
selves.

They weie far from being satisfied with this for an an-
swer, and a great crowd of them came down' in the morn- '
ing, by break of day, to our camp , but, seeing us in such .4
an advantageous situation, they durst come no farther 4

/ \than the brook in our front, where they stood, and showed _
us such a number, as, indeed, temfied us very
those that spoke least of them, sp ' oke-- of ten thousand. -
Here they stood, and looked at us a while; and then, set- .
ting up a ygreat howl', they let fly a cloud of arrows among
us; but we were well enough fortified for that, for we were
sheltered under our baggage, and I do not remember that
, one man of us was hurt. 1
Some time after this we saw them move a little to our
' right, and expected them on the rear, when a cunning fel- '
' low, a Cossack, as they call them, of J arawena in the
pay yof the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the caravan,
said to him, " I will send allg these people away to Sibeil-
ka. " This was a city four or five day s' journey at least
to the south, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow
and arrows, and, getting on horseback, he rides away from
our rear directly, as it were, back to Nertzinskay; after
this, he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the
army ofithe Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell
' them a long story, that the people who had burnt their
Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a cara-
van of miscreants, as he called them, that is to say, Chris-
tians; and that they were resolved to burn the god Scal .
Isarg, belonging to the Tonguses.
' As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke
their language, he counterfeited so well, that they all took
it from him, and away they drove, in a most violent hurry,
to Sibeilka, which, it seems, was five days' journey to the '
south, and, in less than three hours, they were entirely
out of our sight, and we never heard any more of them,
nor ever knew whether they went to that other place"
called Sibeilka or no.
' So we passed safely on to the city of J arawena, where
there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there we rested
five days, the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the
last dayy' s march, and with want of rest' in the nig ht.:
From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us
three- and- twenty days' march. We furnished ourselves
with some tents yhere, for the better accommodating our-
selves in the night, and the leader of the caravan procured

   

much; for - "
, sixteen carriages, or waggons, of the country, for carryi' '
ing our water and provisions; and these carriages were
our defence every night round our little camp ; so that had
the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very numer-
ous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us. ,
We may well be supposed to want test again after this
long journey, for in this desert we saw neither house nor
tree, nor scarce a bush; we saw, indeed, abundance of
the sable-hunters, as they call them. These areall Tar-
tars, of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country is a part,
and they frequently attack small caravans; but we saw '
no numbers of them together. I was curious to see the
sable-skins they catched ; but I could never speak with _
any of them, for they durst not come near us; neither
durst We straggle from our company to go near them.
_' After we had passed this desert, we came into a country
- pretty'well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and
castles settled by the Czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of
stationary soldiers to protect the caravans, and defend
the country against the Tartars, who would, otherwise
make it very dangerous travelling ; and his Czarish majesty
has given such strict orders for the well guarding the
caravans and merchants, that if there are any Tartars
heard of in the country, detachments of the garrison are
always cent tosee travellers safe from station to station.
And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an
opportunity to make a visit to,- by means "of the Scots
merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a
guard of fifty men, if we thought there was any danger,
to the next station. ,
' I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to
Europe, we should find the country better peopled, and
the people more civilized; but I found myself mistaken in
both, for We had yet the nation of the Tonguses to pass
through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and '
barbarity, or worse than before, only, as they Were cone
quered by the Muscovities, and entirely reduced, they Were
not so dangerous; butfor the rudeness of manners, idol-
atry, and polytheism, no people in the world ever went,
beyond them. They are clothed all'in skins of beasts-.-Anarvs'sjuv-rnn crrr-or smnsu. .541; ,

and their houses are built of the same. You knew not f
a man from a woman, neither by the ruggedness of their
countenances nor their clothes; and in the winter, when
the ground is covered with snow, they live under ground,
in houses like vaults, which have cavities, or caves, going
" from one to another. . '

x; If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a
: whole village, or country, these had idols in every hut

7' ' and every cave; besides,- they worship the stars, the sun,

the water, the Snow--and, 'in a word, everything that
they do not understand, and they understand but very

\little--so that almost every element, every uncommon

> :thing} sets them a-sacrificing. - ' '

But I am- no more to describe people than countries,
any further than my own story comes to be concerned in
them. I met with nothing peculiar to myself in all this
country, which I reckon was, from the desert which I

- spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half of it being
another desert, which took us twelve days seVere travel-
ling, without house, tree, or bush; but we were obliged
again to carry our own provisions, as well water as bread.
After we were cut of this desert, and had travelled two
days, we came to Janesay, a- Muscovite city or station,
on the great river J anesay. This river, they told us,

' parted Europe from Asia, though our map-makers, as I
am told, do not agree to it; however, it is certainly the
eastern boundary of the ancient Siberia, which nowmakes
a province only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself
equal in bigness to the whole empire of Germany.- '

, And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism still
prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. All the
country between the river Oby and the river Janesay is -
as entirely pagan, and the people as'barbarous, as the ,
r'emotest of the Tartars; nay, as any nation, for aught I
know,,in Asia or America. 'I also found, which I observed
to the Muscovite governors whom I had opportunity to
converse with, that the pagahs'are not much the wiser,
or the nearer Christianity, for being under the Muscovite
government: which they acknowledged was true enough;
but, they said, it was none of their business; that if the642 turn AND summaries of ROBINSON (meson. _

Czar expected to ,convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or ;
Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen'

among them, not soldiers; and they added, with more
sincerity than I expected, that they found it was not so
much the concern of their monarch to make the people
Christians, as it was to make them, subjects. -
From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a;
wild uncultivated country; I cannot say it is a barbarous
soil; it is only barren of people, and wants good manage-
ment; otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful,
and agreeable country. What inhabitants we *found in
it are all pagans, except such as are sent among them

- from Russm; for this is the country, I mean on both sides

the river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals, that are
not put to death, are banished, and from whence it is
next to impossible they should ever come away.

- I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs,
till I came to Tobolski, the capital of Siberia, where 1
continued some time on the following occasion :--

We had been now almost seven months on our journey,
and winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my part-
ner andI called a council about our particular afiairs, in
which we found it proper, considering that we were bound

for England, and not for Moscow, 0 consider how to -

dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and rein-

.deer to carry us over the snow in the winter time; and,

indeed, they have such things as it would be incredible
to relate the particulars of, by which means the Russians
travel more in thewin'ter than they can in summer; be-
cause in these sledges they are able to run night and day:
the snow being frozen, is one universal covering to nature,
by which the hills, the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all
smooth and hard as a stone; and they run upon the sur'
face, without any "regard to what is underneath. '

-But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of
this kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and
my route lay two ways--either I must go on as the cara-
van went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then go off west
for Narva, and the Gulf of Finland, and so either by sea
or land to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China

> cargo to good advantage; or I must leave the caravan at
' a little townon the Dwina, fiom whence I had but six days
by water to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of

n shipping, either to England, Holland, or Hamburghfi 2 .
iaNow, to go any of these journeys in the winter, would
have been preposterous; for, as to Dantzic, the Baltic

. would ,be frozen up, and I could not get passage; and to

a go by land in those countries, would be far less safe than

among the=Mogul Tartars; likewise to Archangel, in 00.-

tober all the ships would be gone from thence, and even-

the merchants, who dwell there in summer, retire south
to Moscow in thewinter, when the ships are gone; so that

I should have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter,

with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in an

. empty town all the winter: so that, upon the whole, I
thought it much my better way to let the caravan go, and

'to make provision to winter where I was, namely, at T0-

bolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty degrees, where I

was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with,

namely, plenty of provisions, such as the country afi'orded,

2;: 7- a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent company;

5*" of all which I shall give a full account in its place.

i ' I was now in a quite different climate from my beloved
island, where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague; ,
on the contrary, I had much to do to hear my clothes on
my back, and never made any fire but without doors, for
my necessity, in dressing my food, &c. Now I made me

-- three good vests, with large robes, or gowns, over them, to

. hang down to the feet, and button close to the wrists, and

-_., it all these lined with furs to make them sufficiently warm:

7*? I As to a warm house, I must confess, I greatly dislike

' ' our way in England, of makingfires in every room in

the house, in open chimneys, which, when the fire was out,
always kept the air in the .room as cold as the climate.

,But taking an apartment in a good house in the town,~I

ordered a chimney to be built like a furance, in the centre of

six several rooms, like a. stove; the funnel to carry the
smoke went up one way, the door to come at the fire went _
in another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but
no fire seen; like as they heat thxbagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same climatein all the
' rooms, and equal heat was preserved; and how cold soever
it was without, it was always warm within, and yet we

saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with any smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be

possible to meet with good compan here in a country so _

arbarous as that. of the most no erly part of Europe,
near the Frozen Ocean, and within but a very few de-
grees of Nova Zembla.

But this being the country where the state criminals
of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished, this
city was full noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and,
in short, all degrees of the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and
courtiers of Muscovy , here were the famous prince Gallif-
ken, or Galofiken, and his son, the old General Robos-
tisky, and several other persons of note, and some ladies.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

Br means of my Scots merchant, whom, nevertheless, I
parted with here, I made an acquaintance with several 01
these gentlemen, and some of them of the first rank: and
firom these, in the long winter nights in which I staid here,
I received several agreeable visits. It was talking one
night with a certain prince, one of the banished ministers

ofg state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my talk .

of my particular case began. He had been tellinyg me
abundance of fine thin gs, of the greatness, the magnifi
cence, and dominions, and the absolute p,ower of the
Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted him, and told
him, that Iwas a greater and more powerful prince than
ever the Czar of Muscovy was, though my dominions
were not so large, or my people so many. The Russian
grandee looked a little surprised, and, fixing his eyes
steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant

Itold him his wonder would cease when I had explained
myself. First. I told him Ihad the absolute disposal of4+ raw-wen , '1 -. . . ,

-. ONVERSATIONS WITH A BUssuN GRANDEE. 545
the lives and fortunes of all my subjects: that notwithf
standing my absolute power, I had not one person. dis-' '
affected to my government, or to my person, in all my
dominions. He shook his head at that, and said, there,

indeed, I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him, that
all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my
subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will :-
that they would all fight for me to the last drop; and that
never tyrant, for such 1 acknowledged myself to be, was '
ever so universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared, by
his subjects. '

After amusing them with these riddles in government
for a while, I opened the case, and told them the story at
large of my living in the island, and howI managed both
myself and the people there that were under me, just as '

I have since mmuted it down. They were exceedingly
taken with the story, and especially the Prince, who told
me, with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to' be
master of ourselves--that he would not have changed such
a state of life as mine, to have been C-zar of Muscovy; and
that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed
to be banished to there, than ever he found in the high-
est authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the
Czar: that the height of human wisdom was to bring our
tempers down to our circumstances, and to make a calm
within under the weight of the greatest storm without.
~ When he came first hither, he said he used to tear the hair
from his head, and the clothes from his back, as others
had done before him: but a little time and consideration -
had made him look into himself, as well as round him-
' self, to things without; that he found the mind of man,
if it was but once brought to reflect upon the state of uni-
versal life, and how little this world was concerned in its
true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for -
itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best
ends and desires, with but very little assistance from the
world; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life, clothes
for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order to health,
completed, in his opinion, all that the world could do for
us: and though the greatness, the authority, the riches,
and the pleasures, which some enjoyed in the world, and
. 2 u .
WhiOh he had enjoyed his share of, hadmuchinthem that
was agreeable to us, yet, he observed, that all those things
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our afiections; such as our
ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, our vanity, '
and our sensuality; all which were, indeed, the mere pro-
, duct of the worst part of man, were in themselves crimes,
and had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes; but
. neither were related to, or concerned with, any of those
virtues that constituted us wise men, or of those grace:
which distinguished us as Christians: that being now de-
prived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the
full exercise of all those vices, he said, he was at leisure
to look upon the dark side of them, where he found all
manner of deformity; and was now convinced, that virtue '
only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and pre-
serves him in the way to a superior happiness in afuture
state; and in this, he said, they were more happy in their
banishment, than all their enemies were, who had the
full possession of all the wealth and power that they (the
banished) had left behind them.

' " Nor, sir," said he, " do I bring my mind to this politi-
cally, by the necessity of my circumstances, which some
> call miserable ;' but if I know anything of myself, I would
not go back, no, not though my master, the Czar, should
call me, and offer to reinstate me in all my former gran-
deur--I say, I would no more go back to it, than I be-
lieve my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison
.of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state be-
yond life, would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood
it is now enclosed in, and leave heaven to dealin the dirt
and grime of human affairs."

He spake this with so much warmth inhis temper, so
much earnestness and motion of his spirits, which were
apparent in his countenance, that it was evident it wa'o
the true sense of his soul ; and, indeed, there was no room .
to doubt his sincerity. ,

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of monarch in
my old station, of which I had given him an account, but
that I thought he'was not a monarch only, but a great
conqueror; for he that has got a victory over his own
exorbitant desires. and has the absolute dominion over:Znfimmgrsr'pgmm--mqm Pran'flv'q'l'v'Vzla,' um, .- -- . 4-. .

'- tainly greater than he that conquers a city. "But, my

lord," said I, 'f shall I take the liberty to ask you a ques-
tion ? " " With all my heart," said he. " If the door of

' 'your liberty was opened," said I, "' would not you take
- hold of it to deliver yourself from this exile ?"

, " Hold I " said he," your question is subtle, and requires
some serious just distinctions to give it a sincere answer;
and I'll give it you from the bottom of my heart. Nothing
that I know of in this world would move me to deliver
myself from the state of banishment, except these two:
first, the enjoyment of my relations; and, secondly, a
little warmer climate. But I protest to you, that to go
back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power,'the
hurry of a minister of state : the wealth, the gaiety, and
the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a com-tier; if my
master should send ms word this momentrthat he re-
stores me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I know
myself at all, I would not leave thislwilderness, these
deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace of Moscow."

"But, my lord," said I, "perhaps you not only are

'banished from the pleasures of the court, and from the

power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed before, but
you may be absent too from some of the conveniences of
life; your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and your efi'ects.
plundered; and the supplies left you here may not be
suitable to the ordinary demands of life." ..

a'prince, &c. So indeed I am; but you are now to consider ' A '-

me only as a man, a human creature, not at all distin-
guished from another; and so I can suffer no want, unless
I should be visited with sickness and distempers. How-

' ever, to put the question out of dispute: you see our man-
- ner--we are in this place five persons of rank--welive

perfectly retired, as suited to a state of banishment--ave

expenswe, so it is not hard to get suflicient to ourselves:
so that objection is out of doors." \ ' v

I have no room to give a full account of the most agree-
able conversation I had with this truly great man; in all,
which he showed, that his mind was so inspired with a
superior knowledge of things, so supported by religion, as
well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his contempt of
the world was really as much as he had expressed, and
that he was always the same to the last, as will appear in
the story I am going to-tell. .

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful win-
ter I thought it to be. The cold was so intense, that I
could not so much as look abroad without being wrapt m
furs, and a mask of fur before my face, or rather a hood,
with only a hole for breath, and two for sight. The little
day-light we had, was, as we reckoned, for three months,
not above five hours a-day, or six at most; onlythat snow
lying on the ground continually, and the weather being
clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were kept PS01
rather starved) underground; and as for our servants( or
we hired servants here to look after our horses and our-
selves), we had every now and then their fingers and toes
golfhaew, and take care of, lest they should mortify and .

a o . '
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being
close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all
. double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and
cured in the season; good bread enough, but baked as
' biscuits; dried fish of several sorts, and some flesh of
mutton, and of bufl'aloes, which is pretty good beef. All
,the stores of provision for the winter are laid up in the
summer, and well cured. Our drink was water mixed
with acquavitae instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead -
instead of wine, which, however, they have very good.
The hunters, who ventured abroad all weathers, frequently
brought us in fresh venison, very fat and good, and some~
times bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last.
We had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our
friends as above ; and, in a word, we lived very cheerfully
and well, all things considered, '

_ , longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so other tra-

vell' rs began to prepare sledges to carry them over the

. 'tnow, and to get things ready to be going; but my mea-

:eures being fixed, as I have said, for Archangel, and not
.for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no motion, knowing
very well that the ships from the south do not set out for
that part of the world till May or June; and that if I was
there at the beginning of August, it would be as soon as
any ships would be ready to go away ; and therefore, I say,

,I made no haste to be gone, as others did--in a word, I
saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away
before me. It seems, every year they go from thence to
Moscow for trade, namely, to carry furs, and buy neces-
saries with them, which they bring back to furnish their
shops: also others went on the same errand to Archangel ;
but then, they also being to come back again above eight
hundred miles, went all out before me.

In short, about the latter end of May I began to make
all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it occurred

to me, that seeing all these people were banished by the
Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they came
there, were at liberty to go whither they would, why did
they not then go away to any part of the world wherever
they thought fit? and I began to examine what should
hinder them from making such an attempt. ,

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon that
subject with the person I have mentioned, who answered
me thus: " Consider, first," said he, " the place'where we
are; and, secondly, the condition we are in; especially,"
said he, "' the generality of people who are banished hither.
We are surrounded with stronger things than bars and

bolts: on the north side is an unnavigable ocean, where
ship never sailed, and boat never swam; neither, if we had

' both, could we know whither to go with them. Every

other way," said he, " we have above a thousand miles to
pass through the Czar's own dominions, and by ways ut-
terly impassable, except by the roads made by the govern-

ment, and through the towns garrisoned by its troops'; so-

that we could neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor
subsist any other way; so that it is in vain to attempt it."

" ' - I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were

in a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked
up in the castle of Moscow; however, it came into my
thoughts, that I might certainly be made an instrument
to procure the escape of this most excellent person, and
that it was very easy for me to carryhim away, there being
no guard over him in the country ; and as I was not going
' to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the na-

ture of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the ,

stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every
night where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted
to Archangel, where I could immediately secure him on
board an English or Dutch ship, and carry him of! safe
along with men; and as to his subsistence, and other par--
ticulars, that should be my care, till he should better sup-
ply himself.

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on
me all the while I spoke--nay, I could see in his very face
that what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment ;
his colour frequently changed, his eyes locked red, and his
heart fluttered, that it might even be perceived in his
' countenance; nor could he immediately answer me when
I had done, and, as it were, expected what he would say
to it; and after he had paused a little, he embraced me,
: and said, " How unhappy are we, unguided creatures as we
are,' that even our greatest acts of friendship are made
snares to us, and we are made tempters of one another!
My dear friend," said he, "your offer is so sincere, has
such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so
calculated for my advantage, that I must have very little
knowledge of the world, if I did not both wonder at it, and
acknowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for it;
but did you believe I was sincere in what I have so often
said to you of my contempt of the world ? Did you believe
I spoke my very soul toyou, and that I had really main<
tained that degree of felicity here, that had placed me above
all that the world could give me, or do for me ? Did you
" believe I was sincere, when I told you I would not go back,
if I was recalled even to be all that once I was in the court,
and with the favour of the Czar, my master? Did you
believe me, "my friend, to be an honest man, or did you

think me to be a boasting hypocrite ?" Here he stopped, '1-1.4; priorosins To m nussmN owners. ,3 55'!

*- . \ as if he would hear what I would say y; but, indeed, I soon A

 

after perceived, that he stopped because his spirits were

in motion; his heart was full of struggles, and he could
' not go on. I was, I confess, astonished at the thing, as
Well as at the man, and I used some arguments withg him
to urgehim to set himself free; that he ought to look up on
this as a door opened by Heaven, for his dgeliverance, and
a sumnions by Providence, who has the care and good dis-
position of all events, to do himself good, and to render
himself useful in the world. '

He had by this time recovered himself." How do you
know, sir," said he, warmly " but that, instead of a sum--
mons from Heaven, it maybe a feint of another instru-
ment, representing, in all the alluring colours tome, the
show of felicity as a deliverance, which may in itseg: be
my snare, andy tend directly to my ruin ? Here I am
free from the temptation of returning to my former miser-
able gr;eatness there I am not sure, but that all the seeds
of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury ury, which I know
remain in my nature, may revive and take root, and, in
a word, again overwhelm me; and then the happy ypris-
oner, whom you see now master of his soul's liberty,
shall be the miserable slave of his own senses, in the full
possession of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me re-
main in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes
of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the ex-
pense of the liberty of my reason, and at the expense of
the future hap ppiness which now I have in my view, but
shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but flesh,
a man, a mere man, have passions and affections as likely
'to possess and overthrow me as any man: Oh, be not
my friend and my tempter both tog ether I"

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and
stood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admired what
I saw. The struggle in his soul was so great, that, though
the weather was gExtremely cold, it put him into a most
violent sweat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his
mind: so I said a word or two, that I would leave 'him to
consider of it, and wait on him again: and then I with- .
drew to my own apartment.

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near
the d00r of the room, and 1 was gomg to open the door,
but he had opened it, and come in. "My dear friend,"
said he, " you had almost overset me, but I am recovered;
do not take it ill that I do not close with your offer; 'I .
assure you, it is not for want of a sense of the kindness
of it in you : and lease to make the most sincere ac-
knowledgment of it to you ; but I hope, I have got the
victory over myself."

" My lord," said I, " I hope you are Satisfied that you
did not resist the call of Heaven." " Sir," said he, "if it
had been from Heaven, the same power would have influ-
enced me to accept it; but I hope, and am fully satisfied,
that it is from Heaven that I decline it; and I have an
infinite satisfaction in the parting, that 'you shall leave .
me an honest man still, though not a free man."

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make pro-
fession to 'him of my having no end in it but a sincere
desire to serve him. He embraced me very passionately,
and assured me, he was sensible of that, and should
always acknowledge it: and with that he offered me a
very fine present of sables, too much indeed for me to
accept from a man in his circumstances; and I would
have avoided them, but he would not be refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to ,his lordship,
with a small present of tea, two pieces of China damask,
and four little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all
weigh above six ounces or thereabouts, but were far short
of the value of his sables, which, indeed, when I came to
England, I found worth near two hundred pounds. He
accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and one
of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of
the Japan coinage, which I found he took for the rarity
of it, but would not take any more; and sent word by my
servant that he desired to speak with me. .

' 'When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him any
more in that afi'air ; but that, since I made such a gener-
ous offer to him, he asked me, if I had kindness enough
to offer the same to another person that he would name
tome, in whom he had a great share of concern. I told
him, that I" could not say 'I inclined to do so much for,,.r_ --

: nny'one but. himself, for whom I had a particular value,
and should, have been glad to have been the instrument

, of his deliverance: however, if he would please to name

5 the person to me, I would give him my answer, and hoped
- he would not be displeased with me, if he was with my
answer. He told me, it was only his son, who, though I
had' not seen, yet was in the same condition with himself,
and above two hundred .miles from him, on the other side
the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would send for him,

, I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I
made. some ceremony in letting him understand that it
was wholly upon his account; and that, seeing I could not
prevail 0n him, I would show my respect to him by my
concern for his son; but these things are tedious to repeat
here. He sent away the next day for his son, and in about
twenty days he came back with the messenger, bringing
six or seven horses loaded with very rich furs, and which,
in the whole, amounted to a very great value.

His servants brought the horses into the town, but
left the young lord at a distance till night, when he came
incognito into our apartment, and his father presented him
to me; and, in short, we concerted there the manner of
our travelling, and everything proper for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black
fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs that are very
rich--I say I had bought them in that city, in exchange
for some of the goods brought from China; in particular,
for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest
part here, and the rest afterwards- at Archangel, for a
much better price than I could have done at London, and
my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose
business, more particularly than mine, was merchandise,
-was mightily pleased with our stay on account of the
traffic we made here. - -

. It was in the beginning of June when I left this remote

place, a city, I behave, little heard of in the world ; and
indeed, it is so far out of the road of commerce, that I
in a know not how it should be much talked of. We were
' now come to a very small caravan, being only thirty-two
horses and camels in all, and all of them passed for mine,
though my new, guest was proprietor of eleven of them. '
It was most natural, also, that I should take more ser-
vants with me than I had before, and the young lord
passed for my steward; what great man I passed for my-
self I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We
had here the worst and, the largest desert to pass over that
we met in all the journey; indeed, I call it the worst, be-
cause the way was very deep in some places, and Very
uneven in others; the best we had to say for it was, that
we thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers to
fear, and that they never came on this side the river Oby,
or at least but very seldom; but we found it otherwise. '
My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite ser-
'vant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was perfectly
acquainted with the country, and who led us by private
roads, that we avoided coming into the principal towns
and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen, Soloy
Kamaskoy, and several others; because the Mnscovite
garrisons, which are kept there, are very curious and strict
in their-observation upon travellers, and searching lest any
of the banished persons .of note should make their escape
that way into Muscovy; but by this means, as we were
Kept cult of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert,
Ind we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when
we might have had good accommodation in the. cities on
the way: this the young lord was so sensible of, that he
would not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several
cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his servant,
in the woods, and met us always at the appointed places.-
We were just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary between
Europe and Asia: and the first city on the European side
was called Soloy Kamaskoy, which is as much as to say,
the great city on.the river Kama; and here we thought
to have seen some evident alteration in the people, their
manners, their habits, their religion, and their business;
but we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert to pass.
which by our relation is near seven hundred miles long
in some places, but not above two hundred miles over
where we passed it, so, till we came past that horrible
place, we found very little difference between that country
and the Mogul Tartary; the people mostly pagans, andTHREATENED armor er s BAND or warms. 555

, , little better than the savages of Ame rice; their houses

and towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly bar-
barous, except in the cities as above, and the villages near
" them, where they are Christians, as they call themselves,
of the Greek church, but even these have their religion
mingled with so many relics of superstition, that it 13
scarce to be known m some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.

In passingthis forest, I thought indeed we must, after
all our dangers were, in our imagination, escaped, as
before, haveg been plundered, and robbed, and perhaps
murdered, by a troop of thieves: of what country they
were, whether the roving bands of the Ostiachi, a kind of
Tartars, or wild peop leg on the banks of the Oby, had
rang ed thus far, or whether they were the sable-hunters
of Siberia, I am yet at a loss to yknow; but they were all
on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at first
about five; and- forty' 1n number. They came so near to
us as within about two musket- shot: and, asking no ques-
tions, they surrounded us with their horses, and looked
very earnestly upon us twice. At length the yplaced them-
selves just in our way; upon which we drew up in a little
line before our camels, being not ab0ve sixteen men in
all; and being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out .
the Siberian servant who attended his lord, to see who .
they were: his master was the more willing to let him
go, because he was not a little apprehensive that they
were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came
up near them with a flag of truce, and called to them ,
. but though he spoke several of their languages, or dialects
rather, he could not understand a word they said, how-
ever, after some signs to him not to come nearer to them
at his peril, so he said. he understood them to mean,
offering to shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came
back no wiser than he went, only that by their dress he
said he behaved them to be some yyTartars of Kalmuck, or
of the Circassian hordes, and that there must be more
of them on the great desert, though he never heard that
ever any of them were seen so far north before.

This was small comfort to us: however, we had no
remedy; there was on our left hand, at about a quarter
556 mm AND anmumans or nosinson mason.

of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump of trees which -

stood close together, and very near the road :- I immedi-
ately resolved we should advance to those trees, and fortify
ourselves as well as we could there : for, first, I considered
that the trees would in a great measure cover us from their
arrows; and, in the next place, they could not come to
charge us in a body; it was, indeed my old Portuguese
' pilot who proposed it, and who had this eyxcellency attend-
ing him, namely, that he was always readiest and most
apt to direct and encourage us in cases of the most dan-
ger. We advanced immediately with what speed we could,
and gained that little wood, the Tartars, or thieves, for
we knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and
not attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we
found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy,
springy piece of ground, and, on the other side, a great
. spring of water, which, running out in a little rill orbrook,
was a little farther joined by another of the like bigness;
and was, in short, the head or source of a considerable
river, called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which grew
about this spring were not in all above two hundred, but
were very large, and stood pretty thick; so that, as soon
as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the
enemy, unless they alighted and attacked us on foot.
But to make this more dificult, our Portuguese, with in-
defatigable application, cut down great arms of the trees,
and laid them hanging not quite cut off, from one treeto an-
' other, so that he made a continued fence almost round us.
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy some
hours, without perceiving they made any offer to stir;
when, about two hours before night, they came down di-
rectly upon us; and, though we had not perceived it, we
found they had been joined by some more of the same; so
that they were near fourscore horse, whereof, however,
we fancied some were women. They came on till they
were within half a shot of our little wood, when we fired
one musketwithout ball, and called to them,in the Russian
tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid them keep off;
but, as if they knew nothing of what we said, they came
on with a double fury directly up to the wood side, not
imagining we were so barricaded that they could not

break in. -'E Our old pilot was our captain as well as he
had been our engineer; and desired us not to fire upon
' them till they came within pistol-shot, that we might be

sure to kill ; and that, when we did fire, we should be sure ,

to take good aim. We bade him give the word of com- .

mand, which be delayed so long that they were, some of

V . them, within two pikes' length of us when we fired,

a ' We aimed so true, or Providence directed our shot so

" sure, that we killed fourteen of them at the first volley,

and wounded several others, as also several of their
horses ; for we had all of us loaded our pieces with two
or three bullets apiece at least. -
They were terribly surprised with your fire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from us 5 in
which time we loaded our pieces again, and seeing them,
keep that distance, we sallied out, and caught four or five
of their horses, whose riders, we supposed, were killed; '
and, coming up to the dead, we could easily perceive they
were Tartars, but knew not from what country, or how
they came to make an excursion such an unusual length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to attack us
again, and rode round our little wood, to see where else
> they might break in; but finding us always ready to face

E them, they went off again, and we resolved not to stir from
the place for that night.

' We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most
part of the night in strengthening our situation, and
barricading the entrances into the wood; and, keeping
a strict watch, we waited for daylight, and when it came,
it gave us a very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the
enemy, who we thought were discouraged with the recep-
tion they had met' with, were' now increased to no less
than three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve huts 4
and tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us ;' and
this little camp they had pitched was upon the open plain,
at about three quarters of a mile from us. We were in- .

- deed surprised at this discovery; and now, I confess, I

gave myself over for lost, and all that I had. The loss of

my efl'ects did not lie so near me (though they were very
considerable) as the thoughts of falling into the hands of
such barbarians. at the latter end of my journey, after so;

\
many difficulties and hazards as I had gone through {and
_ even in sight of our port, where we expected safety and de-
liverance. 'As for my partner, he was raging; he declared,
that to lose his goods would be his ruin; and he would
rather die than be starved: and he'was for fighting to the
last drop. ' V =-
The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed itself,
was for fighting to the last also; and my old pilot was of
the opinion we were able to resist them all, in the situa-
tion we then were in--and thus we spent the day in de-
bates of what we should do; but towards evening, we
found that the number of our enemies still increased: per-
haps. as they were abroad in several parties for prey, the
first had sent out scouts to call for help and to acquaint
them of their booty--and we did not know but by the
'morning they might still be a greater number; so I began
to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolski,
if there were no other, or more private ways, by which
we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps either re- V
treat to some, town, or get help to guard us over the desert.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, told,
us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would
engage to carry us off in the night to a way that went
north towards the river Petraz. by which he made no doubt
but we might get away, and the Tartars never be wiser; '
but, he said, his lord had told him he would not return,'
but would rather choose to fight. I told him, he mistook
, his lord, for that he was too wise a man to love fighting
for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave enough , ,_
by what he had showed already; but that his lord knew t:
better than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men -
fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced
them to it; and that, if he thought it possible for us to
escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to at-
tempt it; He answered, if his lord gave him such order,
he would lose his life if he did not perform it. We soon
brought his lord to give that order, though privately, and
we immediately prepared for the putting it in practice.
_ And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a
fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and pre- '

   

pared so as to make it burn all night that an Tartars , '. ,2 ARRIVAL AT monamam ~ 559
might conclude we were still there; but, as soon as it was
dark, that is to say, so as we were able to see stars (for
our guide would not stir before), having all our horses
' and camels ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who,
_. ' _ I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north star,
- '. all the country being level for a long way.
' ff: After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began
-' 5 to be lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but
the moon began to rise; so that, in short, it was rather -
lighter than We wished it to be: but by six o'clock next
morning, we Were gotten near forty miles, though the
truth is, we almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a
, Russian village, named Kinnazinskoy, where we rested,

V _ and heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day.
About two hours before night we set out again, and tra-,
velled till eight the next morning, though not quite so"
hastily as before; and about seven o'clock we passed a
little river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large town
inhabited by Russians, and very populous, called Ozomys.
There we heard that several troops or herds of Kalmucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now
completely out of danger of them, which was to our great
satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were obliged to
get some fresh horses; and having need of rest, we staid
five days; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest ~
g "Siberian who brought us hither, the value of ten pistoles
"1" for his conducting us. _ . .

,-- In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the river
3 Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina, we were
there very happily near the end of our travels by land, that a
river being navigable in seven days' passage to Archangel.
- From hence we cameto Lawrenskoy, where the river joins,

' the third of July ; gnd provided ourselves with twoluggage-
boats, andabarge,forour convenience. We embarkedthe .
' ' ' seventh, and arrived all safe at Archangel the eighteenth,
having been a year, five months, and three days, on the
' ' - journey, including our stay of eight months and odd days
at Tobolski.

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the
arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not ,
I Hamburgh er come in above a month sooner than any
of the English ships ; when, after some consideration, that

the city of Hamburg might happen to be as good a' market -

for our goods as London, we all took freight with him ; and

having put our goods on board, it was most natural for me - ,.
to put my steward on board to take care of them; by which '

means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to 0011-.
ceal himself, never coming on shore again all the time we
* staid there; and this he did, that he might not be seen in
the city,- where some of the Moscow merchants would cer.
teinly have seen and discovered him.
. We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of August the
same year, and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived
in the Elbe, the thirteenth 'of September. Here my partner A
and I found a very good sale for ourgoods, as well those 'of
China, as the sables, &c., of Siberia; and, dividing the pro-
'duce of our efi'ects, my share amounted to three thousand
four hundred and seventy-five pounds seventeen shillings
and three pence, notwithstanding so many losses we had
sustained, and charges we had been at : only remembering
that I had includedin this about sixhundred pounds worth

of diamonds, which I had purchased at Bengal! 5

Here' the young lord took his leave of us, and .went up
Ithe Elbe in orderto,go_ to-the'. court of Vienna, wherehe
resolved to ,seek protection, and where he could correspond
with those of hisfather's friends who were left alive. 'He,
