THE STORY OF
 <w
 ROBINSON CRUSOE, who lived over 300 years
ago, has found his way to the stage just as other
famous characters of fiction or history have been
brought before us in the flesh. Crusoe, who lived in
an English village, decided to follow the sea. He was
shipwrecked and washed upon the shores of a desert
island. All others aboard the ill fated ship perished
so that Crusoe was left alone upon the strange island.
Now Crusoe of the story book and Crusoe, who
has been brought to life upon the stage of the Winter
Garden, are very much alike in appearance. Their
dress is the same for their coats are of goat skins and
Crusoe in the play, like his name-sake carries a huge
umbrella made of animal skins.
Of course you have heard of Man Friday? One
day while Crusoe was walking on a strange part of the
island he saw the prints of human feet. It is easy to
imagine his surprise for Crusoe had now been alone
for many months. Presently he discovers a band of
cannibals. These black, wild men have landed on
the island in order to deal death to one of their
kind and then eat him. Crusoe has a gun on his
shoulder, and taking aim at the sky, he fires a barrel.
Immediately, as the report is heard, the cannibals run,
pell mell, towards the water, jump into their canoes
and paddle away. But they leave behind the poor
colored man whom they sought to torture, kill and eat.
A LTHOIJGH this creature cannot speak the lang-
-£*- uage of Crusoe he crawls, on his knees, towards
the white man and by signs makes known his
gratitude, for Crusoe, by firing his gun, has saved
his life. This poor fellow is Man Friday.
In the play at the Winter Garden Man Friday,
or rather Good Friday, he is called, is imperson-
ated by Mr. Al Jolson the comedian who has
always made people laugh because he blacks his
face. So you may" see that it comes quite nat-
urally to Mr. Jolson to play Friday.
  WHILE CRUSOE has lots of trouble poor Friday's lot is even worse.
But Friday is a clever man and when the cannibals or hottentots—
terrible looking creatures they are—set upon him he escapes in a
strange way. There is a plain, everyday tin dish cover. Crusoe calls it
a "persuader" because when it is held before the face of a hottentot the
dish cover reflects the rays of the sun and the bright light dazzles the
wild man. Then with a big wooden club the cannibal may be struck
over the top of the head.
Friday remembers the words of his master and when the black men
surrounded him he reaches for the "persuader" and stick and knocks
down a huge fellow. Then he knocks down another but the third can-
nibal is tough and when Friday strikes him on the head the man laughs.
The harder he hits the louder the man-eater laughs, so Friday begins
to grow weak from the exertion of hitting, but just then a baby croc-
odile crawls up and frightens the black fiends away.

HJE island is literally alive_with all kinds of wild
ials some of them ferocious and you see them
all oh^the stage. Friday knows that mosrx&f the'
animals will bite and he strikes to frighten the
crocodile with the dish cover bidt the crocodile's eyes
are t€>o gr^en and too smeared/over with brash to be
affectech byvthejrays, of the sun. Friday speaks to him
in-animal language and learns that the crocodile^
wants uheat him. So Friday jumps inlo a^well and
the crocodile falls in after himT

A PIRATE SHIP drops anchor off Crusoe's Island and
the gaudily dressed men headed by Captain Dick, a
handsome young chap, come ashore with their captives who
are a bewitching English girl, Captain Chichester and Sailor
Jim, a trim and beautiful boy—Jim. These three have been
taken from a passenger ship which Captain Dick and the
pirates boarded and robbed. Now Jim has read that on this
same Island is a well, and in this well dwells the spirit of
Captain Kidd. As you probably know from your history Capt.
Kidd was a desperate character but Jim believes that his
spirit in the well will be able to aid them in escaping from
the pirates. Accordingly Jim, the girl and Captain Chichester
invoke the spirit.
  /
CAN you guess who answers? Why none other than Friday, and
his replies are very funny, indeed. When the pirates see the
black vision of Friday arise from the well, they flee in con-
fusion. Even Robinson Crusoe has to laugh at Friday.
But this does not end their troublesome lot. Sailor Jim and
the others are re-captured and taken aboard ship along with
Friday and Crusoe. But before we leave the island let us tell of
the Haunted Forest. This is beautiful to behold but dreadful to
enter. There is a fairy nymph who inhabits the island and her
court is composed of the most beautiful girls ever born. Their
skins are fair because they never allow the sun to shine upon
them and their only beverage is goat's milk. The fairy nymph is
wise but she has one desire and that is to enter the Haunted
Forest. It is cool and 'lovely and by the light of ttye moon they
prance like young fillies right into the thick of the forest.
