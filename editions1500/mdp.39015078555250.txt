SURPRIZING
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
JL WAS born of a good family in
the city of York, where my father,
who was a native of Bremen, settled,
after having got a handsome estate
by merchandize. He married my
mother at York, who received her
first breath in that country, and as
her maiden name was Robinson, I
was called Robinson Kreutznaer,
which not being easily pronounced,
we are commonly known by the
name of Crusoe. My heart was very
early filled with rambling thoughts;
and though, when I grew up, my fa.
ther persuaded me to settle to some
14 Surprizing Adventures of
business, and my mother used the
tenderest intreaties, yet nothing could
prevail upon me to lay aside my de-
sire of going to sea; and, being now
about 19 years of age, I at length re-
solved to gratify my roving disposi*
tion, notwithstanding the uneasiness
my father and mother shewed at my
leaving them.
On the first of September, 1651,1
went on board a ship for London, and
without letting my father know the
rout 1 had taken, set sail; but no
sooner was the ship out of the Hum-
ber, than the wind began to blow, and
the sea to rise in a most terrible man-
ner. Having never been at sea be-
fore, I was extremely sick, and my
mind was filled with terror. The
next day the wind abated, and my
companions laughed at my fears, and
with a bowl of punch made me half
drunk, and thus drowned my repewi-
ance and reflections. The weathef
continued calm several days, and we
llobinson Crusoe. 15
went into Yarmouth roads, where
we east anchor. After riding here
four or five days the wind blew ve-
ry hard, but the roads being reckon-
ed almost as good as an harbour, we
were under no apprehensions, till the
eighth day in the morning, when the
wind increased and we had all hands
at work to strike our topmasts, and
at last cast our sheet anchor.
It now blew a terrible storm; I be-
gan to see terror in the faces even of
the seamen themselves, and as the
master passed by me I heard him say,
softly to himself, u Lord be merciful
to us, we shall be all lost."
I cannot express the honor of mind
with which I was seized; I was in ten
times more tremor on account of
slighting my former convictions than
even at death itself. The storm still
increased, and I saw the master, the
boatswain, and several others at pray,
ers, expecting every moment the ship
Would go to the bottom. One of
the men cried out, we had sprung a
leak, upon which all hands were cal-
led to the pump, but the water gained
upon us, and it was apparent that
the ship would founder; the storm
however beginning to abate, the mas-
ter fired guns for help, and a ship,
which had rode it out, just a-head of
us, came near with the utmost hazard
venturing their lives to save ours;
our men casting a rope over the stern,
they, after much hazard, got hold of
it, and we with great difficulty got to
land, and walked to Yarmouth. On
iny arrival in that city, 1 contracted
an acquaintance with the master of a
ship who had been on the coast of
Guinea, and was resolved to go a-
gain; he taking a fancy to me, told
me, I should have liberty of trading
for myself. Encouraged by this of-
fer, and the assistance of some of my
relations, with whom I still corres-
ponded, I raised401. which I laid out
on such toys and trifles^ as my friend
the captain directed me. I got a
competent knowledge of the mathe-
matics, navigation, and how to take
an observation. In a word this voy-
age made me both a sailor, and a
merchant, for my adventure yielded
me in London, at my return, almost
3001.
I now set up for a Guinea trader,
and my friend dying soon after* his
arrival, I resolved to go the same
voyage again in the same vessel, with
one who was his mate in the former
voyage, and had now the command of
the ship. This was one of the most
unhappy voyages ever made, for as
we were steering about the Canary is-
lands and the African shore, we were
surprized in the grey of the morning
by a rover of Sallee, who gave chase
to us, with all the sail she could make.
We finding that the pirate gained
upon us, and would come up with us,
prepared to fight: our ship having
twelve guns, and the pirate eighteen.
About 3 in the afternoon he came up
with us, and a very smart engage-
ment ensued? but we were obliged
to submit, and were ail carried pri-
soners into Saliee, a port belonging
to the Moors.
My master haying the long-boat of
our English ship, had a little cabin
built in the middle of it like a barge.
In this pleasure-boat he frequently
went a-fishing, and as 1 was dextrous
at catching fish he never went with-
out me. One day he appointed to go
out with two or three Moors of dis-
tinction, and he had sent over night
a larger store of provisions than us-
ual, and ordered me to get ready two
or three fusils of powder and shot,
for that they designed to have sport
at fowling as well as fishing.
At this moment the hopes of de-
liverance darted into my thoughts,
and 1 resolved to furnish myself for
a voyage. I told the -Moor, who was
my master's kinsman, that we must
not eat our master's bread; be said
that was true, and brought a basket
of rusk and three jars of fresh water
into the boat. Every thing being
prepared, we sailed out of the port
to fish; but purposely catching none.
I told Muley that we must stand far-
ther off, which he agreed to, and I
having the helm, ran the boat out a
league farther, and then brought to,
as if I would fish, when giving the
boy the helm, I stepped forward, and
stooping behind the Moor, took him
by surprize, and tossed him over-
board; he rose immediately, and
called to me to take him in: but seiz-
ing one of the fowling pieces, I pre-
sented it, [See cut No. 1.] and told
him, if he came near I would shoot
him, as the sea was calm, he might
easily reach the shore. So he turned
about, and, being a good swimmer, I
have no doubt he easily reached it.
I turned to the boy, whom they
called Xury, and said, "Xury, if
you will be faithful to me, I will
make you a great man; but if you
will not, I must throw you into the
sea too." The boy smiled and spoke
so innocently, that I could not mis-
trust him.
The principal thing that we want-
ed was fresh water. We entered a
creek in the evening, but we then
heard such howlings of wild beasts,
that the boy was ready to die with
fear, and begged me not to go on
shore till day. Well, Xury, said I,
then I won't; but we may then see
men who will be as bad as these li-
ons. Then we may give them the
shoot gun, says Xury, laughing, ma-
kee them run away. Such English
Xury spoke by conversing among us
slaves. But though I was no less a-
fraid Hrf the savages than of the wild
befits, our necessities obliged us to
{kind, for we had not a pint of water
left. Xury called softly to me, and
told me to look, for yonder lies a
dreadful monster fast asleep. 1 look-
ed where he pointed and saw a great
lion, 1 took aim at him, and broke
his leg, he started up and gave a hi-
deous roar, hut as he was going to
make off, I fired again, and had the
pleasure to see him drop. Then
Xury asked to go on shore with the
little gun, and dispatched him quite.
I resolved to take off his skin, and go-
ing on shore, the boy and 1 accom-
plished it, but with great laboi. Af-
ter this we still proceeded in hopes of
making the river Gambia or Senegal.
We now saw that the land was in-
habited, and the people were black
and stark naked. I made signs to
them for something to eat, and they
made signs for me to stay. I low-
ered sail and lay by, while two of
them ran up into the country, and in
less than half an hour, they returned
with two pieees of dried flesh, and
some corn, but though 1 was willing
to accept of it, I was loth to venture
on shore to them, and they were as
much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought
it to the shore, and laying it down,
went away and stood at a distance,
till we took it on board, and then re-
turned. At this instant an opportu-
nity offered of obliging them, for two
wild beasts came running with great
swiftness from the mountains. These
naked people were terribly frighten-
ed, and fled, and without attempting
to fall upon the negroes they plung-
ed into the sea; one of them came
nearer our boat than I expeeted ; I
fired and shot him through the head,
lie made towards the shore, but he
died before he could reach it.
About ten days after, as I was
steering out to sea, in order to double
a cape, on a sudden Xury called out
in a fright, Master, master, a ship /
I jumped out of the cabin, and saw
that it was a Portuguese vessel. On
my coming near, they asked me what
I was, in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French; but I understood none of
them 5 at last a Scotch sailor called
to me, and 1 answered I was an En-
glishman, and had made my escape
from the Moors of Sallee. I offered
all that I had to the captain of the
ship, but he would take nothing from
me, and told me all that I had should
be delivered to me when I came to
the Brazils. We had a very good
voyage to the Brazils, and the good
captain recommended me to an hon-
est man who had a plantation and a
sugar-house, with whom I lived, and
learned the planting and making of
sugar, after which 1 took a piece o:
land, and became a planter myself.
Had I continued in the station I was
now in, I might have been happy;
but my fellow-planters prevailed on
me to make a trial of purchasing ne-
groes on the coast of Guinea. We
fitted out a ship, and made sail with
the hopes of purchasing slaves, to as-
sist in our plantations; we had very-
good weather for twelve days, but af-
ter we had crossed the line, a violent
hurricane drove us quite out of our
knowledge. In this distress one of
our men called out land! but the ship
struck against a sand bank. We took
to the boat, and after we had rowed
a league and a half, a wave came
rolling a-stern of us, and overset the
boat at once, so that out of 15, none
escaped but myself. I got upon my
feet and made towards the shore, and
got to land, clambering up the cliffs
of the shore, and sat me down upon
the grass, and being much fatigued^
got up into a tree, and slept comfort-
ably till the morning.
When 1 awoke it was broad day,
and the storm abated, but what sur-
prized me most was, that in the night
the ship had been lifted from the
land by the swelling of the tide, and
driven almost as far as the place
where 1 landed; and 1 saw that if we
had all staid on board we had been
all safe. I swam to the ship and
found she was bilged and had a
great deal of water in the hold; but
to my great joy, saw that all the pro-
visions were dry; and being well dis-
posed to eat, 1 filled my pockets and
eat as I went about other things. I
found several spare yards, top-masts
and planks, with which I made a raft.
1 emptied three of the seamen's chests,
and let them down upon the raft, and
filled them with bread, some dried
goat's flesh, and three Dutch cheeses.
I also let down the carpenter's chest,
two fowling pieces, two pistols, with
some powder, and two rusty swords,
all which I placed on my raft, [See
cut JV*0. 2.~] and after much labor got
it safely landed. My first raft being
too unwieldy, I swam to the ship and
made another; on which I placed
three bags of nails and spikes, some
hatchets, a grindstone, S iron crows,
several muskets, and another fowling
piece, two barrels of musket bullets,
a large bag of small shot, all the men's
clothes 1 could find, a hammock and
some bedding, and to my great com-
fort brought all to land. After 1 had
made five or six of these voyages,
and though 1 had nothing more to ex-
pect from the ship worth taking,
1 found a great hogshead of bread,
three large runlets of rum, a box of
fine sugar, and a barrel of fine flour.
I had been thirteen days on shore,
and eleven times on board the ship,
but preparing the twelfth time, the
wind began to rise, however I ven-
tured on board, and found three ra-
zors, with a dozen of good knives
and forks. It blew very hard all
night, and in the morning no ship was
to be seen. I then went in search
of a place where to fix my dwelling.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a
half circle before a hollow place in
the side of a hill which extended a-
bout 20 yards, and drove large piles
into the ground, sharpened at the
top, and the entrance I made by a
short ladder to go over the top, and
when 1 was in, I lifted it over after
me, so that I was perfectly secure.
[See cut JVo. 3.]
In the miflst of my labors, when
I was rumaging among my things,
I found a little bag with a few husks
of corn in it, and shook it by the side
of my fortification: but how great
was my astonishment, when I saw ten
or twelve ears of barley springing up;
with this barley there came up a few
stalks of riee, and those were of more
worth to me than all the gold in the
world.
I then took a view of the island,
and at about two miles distance from
my habitation, found sume fine sa-
vannahs, and a little further a variety
of fruit, melons upon the ground,
and the trees spread over, and cover-
ed with clusters of grapes. [See cut
tftfy.4.] 1 was so enamoured with this
place, that I built a bower, fenced
by a double hedge: and this coun-
try-house, as I called it, cost me two
months labor, but the rainy season
coming on, 1 was obliged to retreat
to my old one, taking with me grapes
which were now become fine raisins
of the sun.
When my corn was ripe I made
me a scythe with a sword, and cut off
the ears, which I rubbed oat with
my hands. At the end of the har-
vest, I guess'd that 1 had a bushel of
rice, and two bushels of barley. I
kept all this for seed, and bore the
wrant of bread with patience.
When 1 came to make bread 1 had
innumerable wants. 1 wanted a mill
to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and
an oven to bake it. However I had
six months to contrive all these things
in. I made some mishapen pots of
clay, that all broke in the sun except
twtijt which I cased in wicker work;
but I succeeded better in little pans,
flat dishes and pitchers, which the sun
baked surprizingly hard; but they
would not bear the fire so as to hold
any liquid, and I wanted one to boil
my meat.
One day after I had dressed my
dinner, I went to put out my fire,
and found a piece of one of my earth-
en ware vessels burnt as hard as a
stone, and red as a tile; this taught
me to burn my pipkins, and 1 soon
wanted for no sort of earthen ware;
but when I found that 1 had made a
pot which would bear the fire, I had
hardly patience to stay till it was cold,
before 1 set it on with a piece of kid,
in order to make me some broth,
which answered tolerably well.
While all these things were doing,
my thoughts ran many times upon
the land I had seen, and 1 began to
make myself a canoe ; the most pre-
posterous enterprize that ever man in
his senses undertook. I felled a great
C2
cedar, about five feet in diameter
next the root, but when the impossi-
bility of launching this heavy thing
came into my mind, I gave myself
this foolish answer: Let me but once
make it, and I'll warrant I'll get it
along when it is done. I made it
big enough to carry 85 men; but all
my devices to get it into the water
failed me, for I could no more stir it
than I could the island* I then de-
termined since I could not bring my
canoe to the water, that I should
bring the water to the canoe, and be-
gan to dig; but when I calculated
the time this canal would take in
making, 1 found that I could not ac-
complish it in less than twelve years,
and therefore gave it over, determin-
ing to enjoy what I had, without re-
pining for what I could not get.
I had at length a great mind to go
to the point of the island to see how
the shore lay, and resolved to travel
tkitfeer by land. And now reader,
I will give you a short sketch of the
figure I made. I had a great high
shapeless cap, made of goat's skin, a
jacket with the skirts coming down
to the middle of my thighs, and a
pair of open knee'd breeches of the
same, with the goat's hair hanging
to the middle of my leg; stockings
and shoes 1 had none ; but a pair of
somethings, I hardly know what to
call them, to slip over my legs like
spatterdashes, but of a most barbar-
ous shape, and so indeed were all the
rest of my clothes. I had a broad
belt of my goat-skin dried, and in a
frog hung on one side a saw, and on
the other a hatchet. 1 had another
belt not so broad, fastened over my
shoulder. Under my arm hung two
pouches for shot and powder; on my
back 1 carried a basket, on my shoul-
der a gun, and over my head a great
clumsy goat's skin umbrella. My
beard was cut short,except what was
on my upper lip, which 1 had trim-
med into a large pair of Mahometan
whiskers ; but as for my figure, hav-
ing few to observe me, it was no
matter of consequence.
In this figure I went on my new
journey, and was out five or six days.
In one of my excursions, I was ex-
ceedingly surprized with the print of
a man's naked foot on the shore,
which was plain to be seen on the
sand. [See cut JSTo. 5.] 1 stood like
one thunderstruck; 1 listened, look-
ed around; but could hear nothing,
nor see any thing. I went upon a
rising ground to look farther; 1 walk-
ed backward and forward on the
shore, but could see only that one
impression; I went to look at it a-
gain; there was plainly a foot, toes,
heel, and every part distinct: How
it came there 1 knew not; but 1 hur-
ried home to my fortifications, look-
ing behind me every two or three
steps; and fancied every tree, bush
and stump to be a man. I had no sleep
that night; hut my terror gradually
wore off, and I ventured down to
take measure of the foot by my own,
but found it much larger. This fill-
ed me again with ridiculous whim-
sies, and when I went home I began
to double my fortifications, planted
my seven muskets on carriages, in
the manner of cannon, and was at
the expence of an infinite deal of la-
bor, purely from my apprehensions
of this print of a foot.
Rambling more to the western
point one day than ever I had done
Before, I was presently convinced
that the seeing the print of a man's
foot was not such a strange thin|; in
the island, as I had imagined; for on
my approaching the shore, I was per-
fectly confounded and amazed, nor
is it possible to express the horror I
felt at seeing the shore spread with
the skulls, hands, feet and other bones
of human bodies, and particularly a
place, where, as I supposed, there
had besn a fire made, and a circle dug
in the earth for the savage wretches
to sit down to their inhuman feasts,
on the bodies of their fellow creatures.
I had now been twenty-two years
in the island, and was so naturalized
to the place, that had I been secure
as to the savages, I then fancied I
could have been contented to have
staid in it, till like the goat, I had
died of mere old age.
One morning very early I saw five
canoes of the savages on shore. I
clambered up the hill, and by the
help of my perspective, discovered
several of them dancing round a fire;
[See cut J\To. 6.] I soon after saw
two miserable wretches dragged out
of the boats, one of whom was imme-
diately knocked down, but the other
starting from them, ran with incredi-
ble swiftness along the sand towrards
me. 1 confess 1 was horribly fright-
ed when I saw him come my way,
imagining he would be pursued by
the whole body; however, I kept ray
station and quite lost my apprehen-
sion, when 1 saw but three followed
him. He greatly out-ran them, and
was in a fair way of escaping them
all, when coming to a creek, he plung-
into it, landed and ran as swift as be-
fore. Of the three that followed, but
two entered the water, the other re-
turning back. I hastily fetched my
guns from the foot of my ladder, and
taking a short cut down the hill, I
clapped myself in the way betwixt
the pursued, and the pursuers, hal-
looing aloud to him that fled, and
beckoned with my hand for him to
come back; then rushing at once on
the foremost, knocked him down with
the stock of my piece: the other stop-
ped as if frighted; but when I ad-
vanced towards him, I perceived he
was fitting his bow to shoot me, up-
on which I shot him de^d directly.
The poor savage who had fled was
so terrified at the noise of my piece,
though he saw his enemies fallen,
that he stood stock still, but seemed
rather inclined to fly than come for-
wards. However when I gave him
signs of encouragement he came neat-
er, [See cut No. 7.] kneeling down
every ten or twelve steps; on his
coming close to me he kneeled down
again, laid his head upon the ground,
and placed my foot upon it. But
there was more work to do; the man
I knocked down came to himself, and
my savage began to be afraid. I
then presented my piece at the man,
when the poor fellow, whose life I
had saved, made a motion for my
swrord, which I gave him, and he
struck off his enemy's head at one
blow, and in a quarter of an hour he
buried both the bodies in the sand.
I then took him away to my cave at
the farther end of the island; and
gave him bread and some raisins
to eat, and a draught of water which
he wanted very much. Having re.
freshed himself, on my making signs
to him, the poor creature lay down
on some Fiee straw, and soon went
to sleep.
He was & well made handsome
fellow, about 26 years of age, of an
olive coloured complexion, with long
black hair. He had a small nosB
that was not flat, and fine teeth as
white as ivory. After he had slept
about half an hour, he waked again,
and came running to me in the in-
closure just by, where I had been
milking my goats; then falling down
again, he laid his head flat on the
ground, and set my other foot upon
it, as before, and after this made all
possible signs of thankfulness, sub-
jection and submission. I began to
speak to him and to teach him to
speak to me; and first, made him to
know that his name should he Fri-
day, which was the day whereon his
life was saved. I taught him to say
Master, and let him know that was
D
to be my name. The next day I
gave him some clothes, at which he
seemed much pleased. As we went
by the place where he had buried the
two men, he pointed exactly to the
spot, making signs that he would dig
them up again and eat them; at this
I appeared very angry, and beckon-
ed with my hand to him to come a-
way, which he did immediately.
Having now more courage, and
consequently more curiosity, J took
my man Friday with me, and march-
ed to the place where his enemies
had been: when we came there, my
blood ran cold in my veins; the place
-was covered with human bones, and
the ground dyed with blood; great
pieces of flesh were left scattered,
half eaten, mangled, and scorched.
"We saw three skulls, five hands, and
the bones of three or four legs and
feet; and Friday, by his signs, made
me understand, that they brought o-
ver four prisoners to feast upon, and
that three of them were eaten up;
that he, pointing to himself, was the
fourth, and that they had been con-
quered, and taken in war. J caused
Friday to collect the remains of this
horrid carnage, then to light a fire,
and burn them to ashes. When this
was done, we returned to our castle,
1 was now entered into the S7*h
year of my captivity, and intended
soon to set sail, when one morning
J bid Friday go to the sea shore to
see if he could find a turtle; but he
had not long been gone, when he
came running back like one who felt
not the ground on which he trod,
and before I had time to speak cried
O Master! O Master! 0 sorrow!
O bad / What's the matter, Friday?
said Z. O yonder there, said he, one,
two, three! Well, Friday, spid J,
do not be frightened: He was how-
ever, terribly scared, imagining that
they were come to look for him, and
would cut him in pieces and eat him.
Taking ray perspective glass and
going up to the side of the hill, I saw
twenty-one savages, three prisoners,
and three canoes. I bid Friday soft-
ly bring me word what they were do-
ing. He did so, and coming back
immediately, told me that they were
all about the fire, eating the flesh of
one of their prisoners, and that a
bearded man lay bound upon the
sand, whom he said they would kill
next. The news Ired my soul, and
filled me with horror, and going to
the tree, 1 plainly saw a white man
cloathed lying on the beach with his
hands and feet tied with flags. I had
not a moment to lose, for nineteen of
the horrid wretches sat huddled to-
gether on the ground, and the other
two were stooping down to untie the
Christian in order to murder him.
Now, Friday, do as you see me do.
I laid the muskets down and took up
one, and then we both fired; we then
fired again, when seventeen of them
were tilled, and four of them getting
into a canoe, got out to sea.
1 resolved to pursue them lest they
should return with a great* r force to
destroy us, and ran to a canoe, call-
ing to Friday to follow me; but 1 was
no sooner in the canoe than 1 found
another poor creature lie there alive,
bound hand and foot; 1 immediately
cut the twisted flags, and seeing that
he had been bound so tight that he
was almost dead, gave him a dram,
and ordered Friday to tell him of his
deliverance. But when the poor fel-
low looked in his face, and heard
him speak, it would have moved any
one to tears, to have seen how he
kissed, embraced, hugged him, cried,
danced, sung, and then cried again.
It was some time before 1 could make
him tell me what was the matter;
but when he cpea little to himself
be said it was his own dear father.
He then sat down by him, held the
old man's head close to his bosom,
D2
and chafed his arms and ancles,
which were stiff with binding.
The Spaniard having expressed
to toe the utmost gratitude for his de-
liverance, gave me an account of his
shipwreck, and the situation of bis
companions, and it was resolved that
Friday's father and the Spaniard
should go in the boat to fetch them
over. About 8 days after they were
gone, Friday wakened me one morn-
ing, by crying out, Master, they are
come t 1 dressed and hasted to the
top of the hill, and plainly discover-
ed an English ship. [See cut No. 8]
At first 1 felt in my mind a tumult of
joy, which was soon turned into fear;
for though 1 knew them to be my
countrymen, 1 had reason to dread
them as enemies.
They came ashore with the boat
on the beach, and 11 men landed, 8
of them unarmed, who by their ges-
tures seemed to be prisoners; and
one of them 1 could perceive using
tlie most passionate gestures of en*
treaty, affliction, and despair, while
the two others, though their grief
seemed less extravagant, appeared
pleading for mercy. At this instant
1 saw a villain lift up his arm to kill
one of the prisoners ; hut he did not
strike him, The men having left the
prisoners, and gone, into the woods,
1 wrent up to them with my man Fri-
day, and said to them, in Spanish,
"What are you gentlemen?" They
started at the noise; but prepared to
fly. 1 then said in English, "Gentle-
men, perhaps you may have a friend
near you, whom you would little ex-
pect; tell me your case." "1 was
commander of that ship," replied one
of the prisoners, "my men have mu-
tinied against me, afid if they do not
murder me, they intend to leave me
and these two gentlemen ashore in
this desolate place; they are but in
the thicket, and 1 tremble for fear
they shall have seen you, and heard
us speak." Having concerted mat-
ters with the captain, and armed our-
selves, we went to the sailors, and
the captain reserving his own piece,
the two men shot one of the villains
dead, and wounded another. He
who was wounded cried out for help,
and 1 coming up gave orders for spar-
ing their lives, on condition of their
being bound hand and foot while
they staid in the island.
A little after another boat with 10
men and fire arms approached the
shore. We had a full \iew of them
as they came; the captain told me
3 of them were peaceable fellows;
but the rest were desperate wretches.
Having formed an ambuscade, 1 or-
dered Friday and the captain to creep
upon their hands and feet, that they
might not be seen, and to get very
near them before they fired ; but one
of,the principal ring-leaders of the
mutiny, with two of the crew came
towards us, and the captain w as so
eager at having him in his power,
that he let fly, killed him and anoth-
er on the spot, and the third ran for it,
1 immediately advanced with all my
army, upon which Will Atkins, one
of the ring-leaders, called out, For
God's sake,, Captain, spare my life,
the rest are .as bad as 1. The cap-
tain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust upon
the governor's mercy, upon which
they all submitted.
It was now determined to seize
the ship, which, with the assistance
of the faithful part of the crew, the
captain easily effected.
When 1 saw my deliverance thus
put into my hands, 1 was ready to
sink with surprize; 1 was not able
to answer one word, ;but a flood of
tears brought me to myself, and a
little while after I recovered my
speech. 1 then in my turn embrac-
ed "him as my deliverer, and we re-
joiced together. Having brought the
prisoners before me, 1 asked them
what they had to say in their own
defence, telling them 1 had power to
execute them there. They pleaded
the captain's promise of jnercy. 1
then told them that 1 intended to go
as passenger in the ship, with all
my men ; bat that they, if they went,
could only go as prisoners ; observ-
ing however, that they might, if they
chose it, stay in the island. This
they gladly accepted, and 1 prepared
te|non board the next day. The
captain returning to the ship, got ev-
ery thing ready for my reception.
When he was gone, 1 talked tq
the men, told them my story, and
how 1 managed all my houshold
business ; left a letter for the fifteen
Spaniards, and made them promise
to treat them in common with them-
selves. The next day 1 went on
board the ship, taking Friday with
me. Thus 1 left the island, after be-
ing on it 28 years, and arrived safe-
ly in England.
Sometime after I went to Lisbon,
to see after my effects in the Brazils,
and found the generous captain, who
had been so much my friend, still a-
live, and he put me in the way of re-
covering the produce of my planta-
tions. And a few months after there
arrived ships in the Tagus, with ef-
fects for my use, to the amount of
50,0001. besides 10001. a year, which
1 expect to receive annually from my
plantation. And now resolved to
harrass myself no more, 1 am pre-
paring for a longer journey than all
those, for 1 have lived seventy-two
years, chequered with infinite varie-
ety, and been taught sufficiently the
value of retirement, and the blessing
of ending my days in peace and in
the true worship of my Almighty
Deliverer.
