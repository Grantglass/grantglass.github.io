PREFACE TO SECOND PART. 



The success the former part of this work has met 
with in the world, has yet been no other than is 
acknowledged to be due to the surprising variety 
of the subject, and to the agreeable manner of the 
performance. 

All the endeavours of envious people to reproach 
it with being a romance, to search it for errors in 
geography, inconsistency in the relation, and con- 
tradictions in the fact, have proved abortive, and as 
impotent as malicious. 

The just application of every incident, the reli- 
gious and useful inferences drawn from every part, 
are so many testimonies to the good design of mak- 
ing it public, and must legitimate all the part that 
may be called invention, or parable in the story. 

The second part, if the Editor's opinion may 
pass, is (contrary to the usage of second parts) 
every way as entertaining as the first; contains as 
strange and surprising incidents, and as great a 
variety of them : nor is the application less serious, 
or suitable ; and doubtless will, to the sober, as well 
as ingenious reader, be every way as profitable and 
diverting; and this makes the abridging this work, 

VOL. II. h 



vi PREFACE. 

as scandalous ; as it is knavish and ridiculous, seeing, 
while to shorten the book, that they may seem to 
reduce the value, they strip it of all those reflections, 
as well religious as moral, which are not only the 
greatest beauties of the work, but are calculated for 
the infinite advantage of the reader. 

By this they leave the work naked of its brightest 
ornaments ; and if they would at the same time 
pretend, that the author has supplied the story out 
of his invention, they take from it the improvement, 
which alone recommends that invention to wise and 
good men. 

The injury these men do the proprietor of this 
work, is a practice all honest men abhor; and he 
believes he may challenge them to show the differ- 
ence between that and robbing on the highway, or 
breaking open a house. 

If they cannot show any diff*erence in the crime, 
they will find it hard to show why there should be 
any difference in the punishment, and, he will answer 
for it, that nothing shall be wanting on his part to 
do them justice. 



PREFACE 

TO THE FIRST EDITION. 



If ever the story of any private man's adventures in 
the world were worth making public, and were accept- 
able when published, the Editor of this account thinks 
this will be so. 

The wonders of this man's life exceed all that (he 
thinks) is to be found extant ; the life of one man 
being scarce capable of a greater variety. 

The story is told with modesty, with seriousness, 
and with a religious application of events to the 
uses to which wise men always apply them, viz., to 
the instruction of others by this example, and to 
justify and honour the wisdom of Providence in all 
the variety of our circumstances, let them happen 
how they will. 

The Editor believes the thing to be a just history 
of fact ; neither is there any appearance of fiction in 
it ; and whoever thinks, because all such things are 
disputed, that the improvement of it, as well to the 
diversion as to the instruction of the reader, will 
be the same : and as such, he thinks, without further 
compliment to the world, he does them a great 
service in the publication.

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



CHAPTER I. 

XEFLECr/OJ^S UNSETTLED STATE OF MIND^ AND CON- 
VERSATION WITH MY WIFE THEREON — PURCHASE A 
FARM IN THE (BOUNTY OF BEDFORD — LOSE MY WIFE 
— / DETERMINE TO REVISIT MY ISLAND^ AND FOR 
THAT PURPOSE SETTLE ALL MY AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND 
— DESCRIPTION OF THE CARGO I CARRIED OUT WITH 
ME — SA VB THE CREW OF A VESSEL BURNT AT SEA, 

That homely proverb used on so many occasions 
in England, viz., "That what is bred in the bone 
will not go out of the flesh," was never more verified 
than in the story of my LIFE. Any one would think 
that after thirty-five years' affliction, and a variety of 
unhappy circumstances which few men, if any, ever 
went through before, and after near seven years of 
peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things ; 
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed 
me to have had experience of every state of middle 
life, and to know which was most adapted to make 
a man completely happy ; I say, after all this, any 
VOL. II. A 



3 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

one would have thought that the native propensity 
to rambling, which I gave an account of in my first 
setting out into the world to have been so predomi- 
nant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile 
part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and 
I might at sixty-one years of age have been a little 
inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing 
life and fortune any more. 

Nay further, the common motive of foreign adven- 
tures was taken away in me ; for I had no fortune to 
make, I had nothing to seek: if I had gained ten 
thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had 
already sufficient for me and for those I had to 
leave it to, and that I had was visibly increasing; 
for having no great family, I could not spend 
the income of what I had, unless I would set up 
for an expensive way of living, such as a great 
family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, 
which were things I had no notion of, or inclina- 
tion to ; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to 
sit still and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it 
increase daily upon my hands. 

Yet all these things had no efTect upon me, or 
at least not enough to resist the stnxig inclination 
I had to go abroad again, which hung about me 
like a chronical distemper; particularly the desire 
of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the 
colony 1 left there, run in my head continually. I 
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran 
upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my thoughts, 
and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon 
it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing 
could remove it out of my mind.; it even broke so 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3 

Violently into all my discourses, that it made my 
conversation tiresome; for I could talk of nothing 
els^ all my discourse ran into it, even to imperti- 
nence» and I saw it myselfl 

I have often heard persons of good judgment 
say, that all the stir people make in the world 
about ghosts and apparitions^ is owing to the 
strength of imagination, and the powerful operation 
of fancy in their minds ; that there is no such thing 
as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the 
like; that people's poring affectionately upon the 
past conversation of their deceased friends so rea- 
lises it to them, that they are capable of fancying, 
upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they 
see them, talk to them, and are answered by them, 
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and 
vapour in the thing ; and they really know nothing 
of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there 
are any such things as real apparitions, spectres, or 
walking of people after they are dead, or whether 
there is anything in the stories they tell us of that 
kijd, more than the product of vapours, sick minds, 
and wandering fancies. But this I know, that my 
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought 
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may 
call it, that I actually supposed myself oftentimes 
upon the spot at my old castle behind the trees, saw 
my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the reprobate 
sailors whom I left upon the island ; nay, I fancied I 
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily, 
though I was broad awake, as at persons just before 
me; and this I did till I often frightened myself with 



4 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the images my fancy represented to me : one time in 
my sleep I had the villany of the three pirate sailors 
so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and 
Friday's father, that it was surprising ; — they told me 
how they barbarously attempted to murder all the 
Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions 
they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve 
them ; things that I had never heard of, and that 
were yet all of them true in fact ; but it was so warm 
in my imagination, and so realised to me, that to the 
hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that 
it was or would be true ; also how I resented it when 
the Spaniard complained to me, and how I brought 
them to justice, tried them before me, and ordered 
them all three to be hanged. What there was really 
in this, shall be seen in its place ; for however I came 
to form such things in my dream, and what secret 
converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, 
very much of it true, I own that this dream had 
nothing literally and specifically true ; but the general 
part was so true, — the base and villainous behaviour of 
these three hardened rogues was such, and had been 
so much worse than all I can describe, that the dream 
had too much similitude of the fact ; and as I would 
afterwards have punished them severely, so if I had 
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and 
should have been justifiable both by the laws of God 
and man. 

But to return to my story. In this kind of temper 
I had lived some years, I had no enjoyment of my 
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion but 
what had something or other of this in it ; so that my 
wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 

me very seriously one night, that she believed there 
was some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon 
me, which had determined me to go thither again ; 
and that she found nothing hindered my going, but 
my being engaged to a wife and children. She told 
me that it was true she could not think of parting 
with me; but as she was assured, that if she was 
dead it would be the first thing I would do ; so, as it 
seemed to her that the thing was determined above, 
she would not be the only obstruction; for if I 
thought fit, and resolved to go— here she found 
me very intent upon her words, and that I looked 
very earnestly at her ; so that it a little disordered 
her, and she stopped. I asked her why she did not 
go on, and say out what she was going to say ? But 
I perceived her heart was too full, and some tears 
stood in her eyes : " Speak out, my dear," said I ; 
" are you willing I should go ? " " No," says she, very 
affectionately, " I am far from willing : but if you 
are resolved to go," says she, " and rather than I will 
be the only hindrance, I will go with you ; for though 
I think it a preposterous thing for one of your years, 
and in your condition, yet if it must be," said she, again 
weeping, " I won't leave you ; for if it be of Heaven, 
you must do it ; there is no resisting it ; and if Heaven 
makes it your duty to go, He will also make it mine 
to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I 
may not obstruct it." 

This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me 
a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider 
what I was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, 
and hegaLti to argue with myself sedately what busi- 
ness I had, after threescore years, and after such a 



6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

life of tedious sufferings and disasters^ and closed in 
so happy and easy a manner, I say, what business 
had I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon 
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run 
into ? 

With those thoughts, I considered my new en- 
gagement ; that I had a wife, one child born, and my 
wife then great with child of another; that I had all 
the world could give me, and had no need to seek 
hazards for gain ; that I was declining in years, and 
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained, 
than of seeking to increase ft ; that as to what my 
wife had said of its being an impulse from Heaven, 
and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion 
of that ; so after many of these cogitations, I struggled 
with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself 
out of it, as I believe people may always do in like 
cases, if they will; and, in a word, I conquered it ; 
composed myself with such arguments as occurred 
to my thoughts, and which my present condition 
furnished me plentifully with ; and particularly, as 
the most effectual method, I resolved to divert my- 
self with other things, and to engage in some business 
that might effectually tie me up from any more 
excursions of this kind ; for I found the thing return 
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do» 
or anything of moment immediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the 
county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself 
thither. I had a little convenient house upon it, and 
the land about it I found was capable of great im- 
provement, and that it was many ways suited to my 
inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7 

planting, and improving of land ; and particularly 
being an inland country, I was removed from con- 
versing among ships, sailors> and things relating to 
the remote part of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, a waggon, 
horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to work, 
became in one half year a mere country gentleman ; 
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my 
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, 
&c ; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable 
life that nature was capable of directing, or that a 
man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being 
retreated to. 

I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay, 
was limited by no articles; I could pull up or cut 
down as I pleased; what I planted was for myself, 
and what I improved was for my family ; and having 
thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not 
the least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this 
world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjo3red the 
middle state of life which my father so earnestly re^ 
commended to me, a kind of heavenly life, something 
like what is described by the poet upon the subject 
of a country life : — 

" Free from vices, free from care. 
Age has no pains, and youth no snare." 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from 
unforeseen Providence unhinged me &it once ; and not 
only made a breach upon me, inevitable and incurable, 
but drove me, by its consequence, upon a deep relapse 
into the wandering disposition ; which, as I may 5ay> 



8 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

being born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold 
of me, and, like the returns of a violent distemper, 
came on with an irresistible force upon me; so. that 
nothing could make any more impression upon me. 
This blow was the loss of my wife. 

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon 
my wife, to give a character of her particular virtues, 
and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a 
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of 
all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, the 
engine that by her prudence reduced me to that 
happy compass I was in, from the niost extravagant 
and ruinous project that fluttered in my head as 
above; and did more to guide my rambling genius 
than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a friend's 
counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. 
I was happy in listening to her tears, and in being 
moved by her entreaties, and to the last degree 
desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss of 
her. 

When she was gone the world looked awkwardly 
round me; I was as much a stranger in it in my 
thoughts as I was in the Brazils when I went first on 
shore there; and as much alone, except as to the 
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew 
neither what to do, or what not to do; I saw the 
world busy, round me, one part labouring for bread, 
and the other part squandering in vile excesses or 
empty pleasures, equally miserable, because the end 
they proposed still fled from them ; for the men of 
pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped 
up work for sorrow and repentance, and the men of 
labour spent their strength in daily strugglings for 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured 
with ; so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living 
but to work, and working but to live, as if daily bread 
were the only end of a wearisome life, and a weari- 
some life the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my king- 
dom — the island, where I suffered no more corn to 
grow, because I did not want it ; and bred no more 
goats, because I had no more use for them ; where 
the money lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed, and 
had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty 
years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as reason and religion had dictated 
to me, would have taught me to search further than 
human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there 
was something which certainly was the reason and 
end of life, superior to all these things, and which was 
either to be possessed or at least hoped for on this 
side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone ; I was like a ship 
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind ; 
my thoughts ran all away again into the old affair ; 
my head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign 
adventures ; and all the pleasing innocent amusements 
of my farm and my garden, my cattle and my family, 
which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to 
me, had no relish, and were like music to one. that 
has no ear, or food to one that has no taste : in a 
word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my 
farm, and return to London ; and in a few months 
after I did so. 

When I came to London I was still as uneasy as 



lo THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

before ; I had no relish to the place, no employment 
in it» nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle 
person, of whom it may be said, he is perfectly use- 
less in God's creation, and it is not one farthing 
matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead 
or alive. This also was the thing which of all cir- 
cumstances of life was the most my aversion, who 
had been all my days used to an active life; and I 
would often say to myself, "A state of idleness is 
the very dregs of life ; " and indeed I thought I was 
much more suitably employed when I was twenty-six 
days making me a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I 
had brought up to the sea and had made him 
commander of a ship, was come home from a short 
voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had made; he 
came to me, and told me that some merchants of 
his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go 
a voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, 
as private traders; "And now, uncle," says he, "if 
you will go to sea with me, I'll engage to land yon 
upon your old habitation in the island, for we are to 
touch at the Brazils." 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future 
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than 
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of 
things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved^ 
and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper 
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say, when 
that very* morning, before he came to me^ I had, in 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. i x 

a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving 
every part of my circumstances in my mind, come 
to this resolution, viz., that I would go to Lisbon 
and consult with my old sea-captain ; and so, if it 
was rational and practicable, I would go and see the 
island again, and see what was become of my people 
there. I had pleased myself also with the thoughts 
of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from 
hence, getting a patent for the possession, and I 
know not what ; when, in the middle of all this, in 
comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project of 
carrying me thither in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily 
at him, "What devil," said I, "sent you of this un- 
lucky errand?" My nephew stared, as if he had 
been frighted at first; but perceiving I was not 
much displeased with the proposal, he recovered 
himself. "I hope it may not be an unlucky pro- 
posal, sir," says he ; "I daresay you would be pleased 
to see your new colony there, where you once reigned 
with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs 
in the world." 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my 
temper, that is to say, with the prepossession I was 
under, and of which I have said so much, that I told 
him, in a few words, if he agreed with the mer- 
chants, I would go with him: but I told him I 
would not promise to go any farther than my own 
island. "Why, sir," says he, "you don't want to 
be left there again, I hope } " — " Why," said I, " can 
you not take me up again in your return ?" He told 
me, it could not be possible that the merchants 
would allow him to come that way with a loaden 



12 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ship of such value^ it being a month's sail out of his 
way, and might be three or four: ^Besides, sir, if 
I should miscarry/' said he, "and not return at all, 
then you would be just reduced to the condition you 
were in before." 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a 
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop on 
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces, and 
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of 
some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, 
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go 
to sea in a few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for indeed the impor- 
tunities of my nephew joined in so effectually with 
my inclination, that nothing could oppose me; on 
the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody 
concerned themselves so much for me as to persuade 
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend 
the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to con- 
sider my years, my easy circumstances, and the need- 
less hazard of a long voyage; and, above all, my 
young children ; but it was all to no purpose ; I had 
an irresistible desire to the voyage ; and I told her I 
thought there was something so uncommon in the 
impressions I had upon my mind for the voyage, 
that it would be a kind of resisting Providence, if I 
should attempt to stay at home ; after which she 
ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not 
only in making provision for my voyage, but also in 
settling my family affairs in my absence, and provid- 
ing for the education of my children. 

In order to this I made my will, and settled the 
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 13 

placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and 
satisfied they would have justice done them, what- 
ever might befall me; and for their education, I 
left it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient mainten- 
ance to herself for her care ; all which she richly de- 
served ; for no mother could have taken more care 
in their education or understood it better ; and as 
she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her 
for it 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning 
of January 1694-5, ^^^ I with my man Friday went 
on board in the Downs on the 8th, having, besides 
that sloop which I mentioned above, a very consider- 
able cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my 
colony, which if I did not find in good condition, I 
resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I 
purposed to place there as inhabitants, or at least 
to set on work there upon my own account while I 
stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry them 
forward, as they should appear willing ; particularly, 
I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy 
ingenious fellow who was a cooper by trade, but was 
also a general mechanic; for he was dexterous at 
making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, was a 
good turner, and a good pot-maker; he also made 
anything that was proper to make of earth or of 
wood; in a word, we called him our Jack of all 
Trades. 

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered 
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new 
plantation, and proved a most necessary handy fellow 



14 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

as could be desired, in many other businesses besides 
that of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly, necessity 
arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have 
not kept an account of the particulars, consisted of a 
sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin English 
stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to 
find there, and enough of them as, by my calculation, 
might comfortably supply them for seven years : if I 
remember right, the materials which I carried for 
clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, 
and all such things as they could want for wearing, 
amounted to above two hundred pounds, including 
some beds, bedding, and household-stuff, particularly 
kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c., 
besides near a hundred pounds more in iron work, 
nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and 
every necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and 
fuzees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity 
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and 
two pieces of brass cannon ; and because I knew not 
what time and what extremities I was providing for, 
I carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, 
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and hal- 
berts ; so that, in short, we had a large magazine of 
all sorts of stores ; and I made my nephew carry two 
small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his 
ship, to leave behind if there was occasion ; that 
when they came there we might build a fort, and 
man it against all sorts of enemies : and indeed I at 
first thought there would be need enough of it all, 
and much more, if we hoped to maintain our pos- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 5 

session of the island, as shall be seen in the course of 
the story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had 
been used ta meet with ; and therefore shall have the 
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps 
may be impatient to hear how matters went with my 
colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and 
bad weather, happened on this first setting out, which 
made the voyage longer than I expected it at first ; 
and I, who had never made but one voyage, viz., my 
first voyage to Guinea,, in which I might be said to 
come back again as the voyage was at first designed, 
began to think the same ill fate still attended me ; 
and that I was born to be never contented with 
being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at 
sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, 
where we lay wind-bound two-and-thirty days: but 
we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that pro- 
visions were here exceeding cheap and in the utmost 
plenty ; so that while we lay here we never touched 
the ship's stores, but rather added to them : here also 
I took several hogs and two cows with their calves, 
which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on 
shore in my island ; but we found occasion to dispose 
otherwise of them. 

We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and 
had a very fair gale of wind for some days ; as I 
remember, it might be about the 20th of February in 
the evening late, when the mate having the watch 
came into the round-house, and told us he saw a flash 
of fire and heard a gun fired ; and while he was 



i6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

telling us of it, a boy came in and told us the boat- 
swain heard another. This made us all run out upon 
the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing ; 
but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and 
found that there was some very terrible fire at a 
distance. Immediately we had recourse to our 
reckonings, in which we all agreed that there could 
be no land that way in which the fire showed itself, 
no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at 
W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it must be some 
ship on fire at sea ; and as by our hearing the noise 
of guns just before, we concluded it could not be far 
off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently 
satisfied we should discover it, because the further 
we sailed the greater the light appeared, though the 
weather being hazy we could not perceive anything 
but the light for a while ; in about half an hour's 
sailing, the wind being fair for us, though not much 
of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we could 
plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the 
middle of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, 
though not at all acquainted with the persons en- 
gaged in it ; I presently recollected my former cir- 
cumstances, in what condition I was in when taken 
up by the Portugal captain ; and how much more 
deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures 
belonging to this ship must be if they had no other 
ship in company with them : upon this I immediately 
ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon after 
another, that, if possible, we might give notice to 
them that there was help for them at hand, and that 
they might endeavour to save themselves in their 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

boat; for though we could see the flame in the ship, 
yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as 
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight ; when 
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had 
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and 
immediately sank. This was terrible, and indeed an 
afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I 
concluded^ must be either all destroyed in the ship, 
or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the 
middle of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it 
was dark, I could not see : however, to direct them 
as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in 
all the parts of the ship where we could, and which 
we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the 
night long; letting them know by this that there 
was a ship not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered 
the ship's boats by the help of our perspective- 
glasses : and found there were two of them, both 
thronged with people, and deep in the water ; we 
perceived they rowed, the wind being against them ; 
that they saw our ship, and did the utmost to make 
us see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them 
know we saw them ; and hung a waft out, as a signal 
for them to come on board; and then made more 
sail, standing directly to them. In a little more than 
half an hour we came up with them, and in a word 
took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, 
women, and children ; for there were a great many 
passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French mcr- 

VOL. II. B 



i8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

chant-ship of three hundred tons, homeward-bounc! 
from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master 
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, 
how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence 
of the steersman; but, on his crying out for help, 
was, as everybody thought^ entirely put out: but 
they soon found that some sparks of the first fire 
had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to 
come at, that they could not effectually quench it ; 
and afterwards getting in between the timbers, and 
within the ceiling of the ship> it proceeded into the 
hold, and mastered all the skill and all the applica- 
tion they were able to exert 

They had no more to do then but to get into their 
boats, which to their great comfort were pretty large ; 
being their long-boat, and a great shallop, besides 1 
small skiff, which was of no great service to them, 
other than to get some fresh water and provisions 
into her, after they had secured themselves from the 
fire. They had indeed small hope of their lives by 
getting into these boats, at that distance from any 
land ; only, as they said well, that they were escaped 
from the fire, and had a possibility that some ship 
might happen to be at sea, and might take them in. 
They had sails, oars, and a compass ; and were pre- 
paring to make the best of their way to Newfound- 
land, the wind blowing pretty fair ; for it blew an 
easy gale at S.E. by E. They had as much provi- 
sions and water, as, with sparing it so as to be next 
door to starving, might support them about twelve 
days; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no 
contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he might 
get to the banks of Newfoundland, and might per- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

haps take some fish to sustain them till they might 
go on shore. But there were so many chances against 
them in all these cases; such as storms to overset 
and founder them; rains and cold to benumb and 
perish their limbs ; contrary winds to keep them out 
and starve them ; that it must hav6 been next to 
miraculous if they had escaped. 

In the midst of their consultations, every one being 
hopeless and ready to despair, the captain, with tears 
in his eyes, told me, they were on a sudden surprised 
with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four 
more ; these were the five guns which I caused to be 
fired at first seeing the light : this revived their hearts, 
and gave them the notice which, as above, I designed 
it should, viz., that there was a ship at hand for their 
help. 

It was upon the hearing these guns that they took 
down their masts and sails; and the sound coming 
from the windward, they resolved to lie by till morn- 
ing. Some time after this, hearing no more guns, 
they fired three muskets, one a considerable while 
after another; but these, the wind being contrary, 
we never heard. 

Some time after that again they were still more 
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights and hear- 
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be 
fired all the rest of the night : this set them to work 
with their oars to keep their boats ahead, at least 
that we might the sooner come up with them ; and 
at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw 
them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several ges^ 
tures, the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, 



20 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

which these poor delivered people ran into, to express 
the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance ; 
grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tears, 
groans, and a very few motions of head and hands, 
make up the sum of its variety : but an excess of joy, 
a surprise of joy^ has a thousand extravagances in it; 
there were some in tears, some raging and tearing 
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest 
agonies of sorrow ; some stark raving and downright 
lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with 
their feet, others wringing their hands; some were 
dancing, several singing, some laughing, more cry* 
ing: many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; 
others sick and vomiting, several swooning, and ready 
to faint ; and a few were crossing themselves and 
giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there might be 
many that were thankful afterward ; but the passion 
was too strong for them at first, and they were not 
able to master it; they were thrown into ecstasies 
and a kind of frenzy, and so there were but a very 
few who were composed and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps also the case may have some addition to 
it, from the particular circumstance of the nation 
they belonged to; I mean the French, whose temper 
is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate and 
more sprightly, iand their spirits more fluid than of 
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to 
determine the cause, but nothing t had ever seen 
before came up to it : the ecstasies poor Friday, my 
trusty savage, was in when he found his father in the 
boat came the nearest to it ; and the surprise of the 
master and his tw^o companions whom I delivered 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

from the two villains that set thetn on shore in the 
island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was 
to compare to this, either that I saw in Friday or any? 
where else in my life. 

It is further observable, that these extravagfances 
did not show themselves in that different manner I 
have mentioned, in different persons only: but all 
the variety would appear in a short succession of 
moments in one and the same person. A man that 
we saw this minute dumb, and as it were stupid and 
confounded, should the next minute be dancing and 
hallooing like an antic; and the next moment a-tearing 
his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping 
them under his feet like a madman ; a few minutes 
after that we should have him all in tears, then sick, 
then swooning; and had not immediate help been 
had, would in a few moments more have been dead \ 
and thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, 
but with the greatest part of them ; and, if I remem- 
ber right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty 
of them blood. 

There were two priests among them, one an old 
man, and the other a young man ; and that which 
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the worst. 

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and 
saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead, to all 
appearance; not the least sign of life could be per- 
ceived in him; our surgeon immediately applied 
proper remedies to recover him; and was the only 
man in the ship that believed he was not dead : and 
at length he opened a vein in his arm, having first 
chafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as 
much as pots^ble : upon this the blood, which only 



A 



22 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

dropped at first, flowed something freely ; in three 
minutes after the man opened his eyes ; and about 
a quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew better, 
and, in a little time, quite well ; after the blood was 
stopped he walked about, told us he was perfectly 
well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave 
hini, and was, what we called, come to himself; about 
a quarter of an hour after this they came running 
into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a 
French woman that had fainted, and told him the 
priest was gone st^rk mad. It seems he had begun 
to revolve the change of his circumstances in his 
mind, and this put him into an ecstasy of joy : his 
spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could 
convey them ; the blood grew hot and feverish ; and 
the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that 
ever was in it ; the surgeon would not bleed him again 
in that condition, but gave him something to dose and 
put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated 
upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly 
composed and well. 

The younger priest behaved himself with great 
command of his passion, and was really an example 
of a serious, well-governed mind ; at his first coming 
on board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, 
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance; 
in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed 
him, really thinking he had been in a swoon : but he 
spoke calmly ; thanked me ; told me he was giving 
God thanks for his deliverance ; begged me to leave 
him a few moments, and that next to his Maker he 
would give me thanks also. 
. I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

6nly left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
also; he continued in that posture about three minutes, 
or a little more, after I left him, then came to me as he 
had said he would, and with a great deal of seriousness 
and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me 
that had, under God, given him and so many miser- 
able creatures their lives : I told him I had no room 
to move him to thank God for it rather than me ; 
for I had seen that he had done that already ; but 
I added, that it was nothing but what reason and 
humanity dictated to all men, and that we had as 
much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had 
blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of His 
mercy to many of His creatures. 

After this the young priest applied himself to his 
country-folks ; laboured to compose them ; persuaded, 
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his 
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their rea- 
son; and with some he had success, though others 
were, for a time, out of all government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps 
it may be useful to those into whose hands it may 
fall, in the guiding themselves in all the extravagances 
of their passions ; for if an excess of joy can carry 
men out to such a length beyond the reach of their rea- 
son, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and 
a provoked mind, carry us to ? And, indeed, here 
I saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our 
passions of every kind, as well those of joy and satis- 
faction, as those of sorrow and anger. 

We were something disordered by these extrava- 
gances among our new guests for the first day : but 
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for 



\ 



24 THE LIFE AND AD VENTURES 

them as well as our ship would allow, and they had 
slept heartily, as most of them did, being fatigued and 
frightened, they were quite another sort of people the 
next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledg-* 
ments for the kindness shown them, was wanting ; the 
French, it is known, are naturally apt enough to ex- 
ceed that way. The captain and one of the priests 
came to me the next day ; and, desiring to speak with 
me and my nephew, the commander began to consult 
with us what should be done with them ; and first 
they told us, that as we had saved their lives, so all 
they had was little enough for a return to us for 
the kindness received. The captain said they had 
saved some money, and some things of value in their 
boats, caught hastily out of the flames ; and if we 
would accept it, they were ordered to make an offer 
of it all to us ; they only desired to be set on shore 
somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might 
get a passage to France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at first 
word, and to consider what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I overruled him in that part ; for I knew 
what it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; 
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea 
had served me so, and took all I had for my de- 
liverance, I must have starved, or have been as much 
a slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the 
being sold to a Mahometan only excepted ; and per- 
haps a Portuguese is not a much better master than 
a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had 
taken them up in their distress, it was true ; but that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures, 
and as we would desire to be so delivered, if we were 
in the like or any other extremity ; that we had done 
nothing for them but what we believed they would 
have done for us if we had been in their case and 
they in ours ; but that we took them up to serve 
them, not to plunder them ; and that it would be a 
most barbarous thing to take that little from them 
which they had saved out of the fire, and then set 
them on shore and leave them ; that this would bo 
first to save them from death, and then kill them 
ourselves; save them from drowning, and then 
abandon them to starving; and therefore I would 
not let the least thing be taken from them : as to 
setting them on shore, I told them indeed that it was 
an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was 
bound to the East Indies ; and though we were driven 
out of our course to the westward a very great way, 
which perhaps was directed by Heaven on purpose 
for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us 
wilfully to change our voyage on this particular 
account ; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer 
it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter- 
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil : and 
all I knew he could do for them was to put ourselves 
in the way of meeting with other ships homeward- 
bound from the West Indies, and get them passage^ 
if possible, to England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and 
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it ; but 
they were in a great consternation, especially the 
passengers, at the notion of being carried away to 
the Eaist Indies : they then entreated me, that seeing 



26 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was driven so far to the westward before I met 
with them, I would at least keep on the same course 
to the banks of Newfoundland, where it was possible 
I might meet with some ship or sloop that they 
might hire to cany them back to Canada, from 
whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on 
their part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it; 
for indeed I considered, that to carry this whole 
company to the East Indies would not only be an 
intolerable severity to the poor people, but would be 
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our pro- 
visions ; so I thought it no breach of charter-party, 
but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely 
necessary to us; and in which no one could say we 
were to blame ; for the laws of God and nature 
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up 
two boats' full of people in such a distressed condi- 
tion ; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting 
ourselves, as the poor people, obliged us to see them 
on shore somewhere or other, for their deliverance ; 
so I consented that we would carry them to New- 
foundland, if wind and weather would permit ; and, 
if not, that I would carry them to Martinico in the 
West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather 
pretty good ; and as it had blowed continually in 
the points between N.E. and S.E. a long time, we 
missed several opportunities of sending them to 
France; for we met several ships bound to Europe, 
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's; 
but they had been so long beating up against the 
wind, that they durst take in no passengers for fear 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 

of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for 
themselves as for those they should take in ; so we 
were obliged to go on. It was about a week after 
this that we made the banks of Newfoundland, 
where, to shorten my story, we put all our French 
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea 
there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry 
them to France, if they could get provisions to 
victual themselves with : when, I say, all the French 
went on shore, I should remember that the young 
priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East 
Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be 
set on shore on the coast of Coromandel : I readily 
agreed to that ; for I wonderfully liked the man, and 
had very good reason, as will appear afterwards; also 
four of the seamen entered themselves in our ship, 
and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West 
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about 
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind 
at all, when we met with another subject for our 



2% THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that 
before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N. 
and the 19th day of March 1684-5, when we espied 
a sail, our course S.E. and by S. We soon per- 
ceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to 
us ; but could not at first know what to make of her, 
till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had 
lost her maintopmast, foremast, and bowsprit ; and 
presently she fires a gun as a signal of distress. The 
weather was pretty good, wind at N.N.W, a fresh 
gale, and we soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from 
Barb^does, but had been blown out of the road at 
Barbadoes, a few days before she was ready to sail, 
by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief 
mate were both gone on shore ; so that, beside the 
terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent 
case for good artists to bring the ship home; they 
had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met 
with another terrible storm after the hurricane was 
over, which had blown th^m quite out of their know- 
ledge to the westward, and in which they had lost 
their masts, as above; they told us, they expected 
to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then 
driven away again to the south-east by a strong gale 
of wind at N.N.W. the same that blew now, and 
having no sails to work the ship with, but a main- 
course and a kind of square sail upon a jury- fore- 
mast, which they had set up, they could not lie near 
the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for 
the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all, was^ that they 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

were almost starved for want of provisions, besides 
the fatigues they had undergone: their bread and 
flesh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in 
the ship, and had had none for eleven days ; the only 
relief they had was, their water was not all spent, 
and they had about half a barrel of flour left ; they 
had sugar enough; some succades or sweetmeats 
they had at first, but they were devoured ; and they 
had seven casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid- 
servant, on board who were going passengers, and 
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came 
on board the evening before the hurricane began; 
and, having no provisions of their own left, they 
were in a more deplorable condition than the rest ; 
for the seamen, being reduced to such an extreme 
necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may 
be sure, for the poor passengers; and they were 
indeed in a condition that their misery is very hard 
to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity 
had not led me, die weather being fair, and the wind 
abated, to go on board the ship: the second mate, 
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had 
been on board our ship ; and he told me indeed, that 
they had three passengers in the great cabin, that 
they were in a deplorable condition ; *' Nay," says he, 
" I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of 
them for above two days ; and I was afraid to inquire 
after them," said he, "for I had nothing to relieve 

them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them 
what relief we could spare ; and indeed I had so far 



( 



30 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

overruled things with my nephew, that I would 
have victualled them, though we had gone away to 
Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to have 
supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for 
that 

But now they were in a new danger, for they were 
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave 
them. The mate or commander brought six men 
with him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked 
like skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly 
sit to their oars ; the mate himself was very ill, and 
half starved, for he declared he had reserved nothing 
from the men, and went share and share alike with 
them in every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat 
before him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of 
order ; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed 
him up something with some broth, which he said 
would be to him both food and physic ; and after he 
had taken it, he grew better: in the meantime I 
forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to be given 
them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than 
ate it; they were so exceeding hungry, that they 
were in a manner ravenous, and had no command 
of themselves; and two of them ate with so much 
greediness, that they were in danger of their lives the 
next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very 
moving to me, and brought to mind what I had a 
terrible prospect of at my first coming on shore in 
my island, where I had not the least mouthful of 
food, or any hopes of procuring it; besides the hourly 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 

apprehension I had of being made the food of other 
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus re- 
lating to me the miserable condition of the ship's 
company, I could not put out of my thought the 
story he had told me of the three poor creatures in 
the great cabin ; viz., the mother, her son, and the 
maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two 
or three days ; and whom he seemed to confess they 
had wholly neglected, their own extremities being so 
great ; by which I understood, that they had really 
given them no food at all; and that therefore they 
must be perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on 
the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called 
captain, on board with his men, to refresh them^ so 
I silso forgot not the starving crew that were left on 
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the 
ship, and with my mate and twelve men to carry 
them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef 
to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the 
meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep 
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking 
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it 
was well boiled, and then to give- every man but a 
little at a time ; and by this caution he preserved the 
men, who would otherwise have killed themselves 
with that very food that was given them on purpose 
to save their lives. 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor 
passengers were in, and, if they were alive, to comfort 
them and give them what refreshment was proper^ 
and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher with some 



32 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

of the prepared broth which he had given the mate 
that was on board, and which he did not question 
would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above, 
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, 
which I knew the ship itself would present me with, 
in a more lively manner than I could have it by 
report, I took the captain of the ship, as we now 
called him, with me, and went myself a little after in 
their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult 
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was 
ready ; but my mate observed his order, and kept a 
good guard at the cook-room door ; and the man he 
placed there, after using all possible persuasion to 
have patience, kept them off by force : however, he 
caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, 
and softened them with the liquor of the meat, which 
they call brewis, and gave every one one, to stay 
their stomachs, and told them it was for their own 
safety that he was obliged to give them but little at 
a time. But it was all in vain, and had I not come 
on board, and their own commander and officers with 
roe, and with good words, and some threats also of 
giving them no more, I believe they would have 
broke into the cook-room by force, and torn the 
meat out of the furnace ; for words indeed are of a 
very small force to a hungry belly: however, wc 
pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously 
for the first time, and the next time gave them more, 
and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well 
enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

was of another nature, and far beyond the rest ; for 
as, first, the ship's company had so little for them- 
selves, it was but too true, that they had at first kept 
them very low, and at last totally neglected them ; 
so that for six or seven days it might be said they 
had really had no food at all, and for several days 
before very little. 

The poor mother, who, as the first mate reported, 
was a woman of good sense and good breeding, had 
spared all she could get so affectionately for her son, 
that at last she entirely sunk under it ; and when the 
mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or 
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two 
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk in 
between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not 
quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive and 
encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into 
her mouth; she opened her lips, and lifted up one 
hand, but could not speak: yet she understood what 
he said, and made signs to him, intimating that it 
was too late for her ; but pointed to her child, as if 
she would have said they should take care of him. 

However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth 
into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or three 
spoonfuls down, though I question whether he could 
be sure of it or not ; but it was too late, and she died 
the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his 
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone; 
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with 
hardly any life left in him; he had a piece of an old 
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it; 

VOL. II. C 



34 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

however^ beings young, and having more strength 
than his mother, the mate got something down his 
throat, and he began sensibly to revive, though, by 
giving him some time after but two or three spoon- 
fuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it 
yp again. 

But the next care was the poor maid ; she lay all 
^long upon the deck hard by her mistress, and just 
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and 
struggled for life ; her limbs were distorted ; one of 
her hands was clasped round the frame of one chair, 
and she griped it so hard, that we could not easily 
make her let it go; her other arm lay over her head, 
and her feet lay both tc^ether, set fast against the 
frame of the cabin-table ; in short, she lay just like 
one in the last agonies of death; and yet she was 
alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger 
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the 
men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her 
mistress, whom she saw dying two or three days 
before, and whom she loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for 
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great 
knowledge and experience, and with great applica- 
tion recovered her as to life, he had her upon his 
hand as to her senses; for she was little l^s than 
distracted for a considerable time after, as shall appear 
presently. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be 
desired to consider, that visits at sea are ^ot like a 
journey into ^he country, where sometimes people 
stay a week or ;i fortnight at a place. Our business 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not h'e 
by for them ; and though they were willing to steer 
the same course with us for some days, yet we could 
carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no 
masts: however, as their captain begged of us to 
help him to set up a maintopmast, and a kind of 
topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were, lie 
by him for three or four days, and then having given 
him five barrels of beef and pork, two hogsheads of 
biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what 
other things we could spare ; and taking three casks 
of sugar and som^rum, and some pieces of eight of 
them for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board 
with us, at their own earnest request, the youth and 
the maid, and alt their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, 
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth ; 
greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as 
it seems, had lost his father but a few months before 
at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak 
to me, to take him out of the ship ; for he said the 
cruel fellows had murdered his mother ; and indeed 
so they had, that is to say, passively; for they might 
have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless 
widow, that might have preserved her life, though it 
had been just to keep her alive. But hunger knows 
no friend, no relation, no justice, no right ; and 
therefore is remorseless and capable of no com- 
passion. 

The sui^eon told him how far we were going, and 
how it would carry him away from all his friends, 
and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances 
almost as we found them in ; that is to say, starving 



36 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in the world. He said it mattered not whither he 
went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew 
that he was among; that the captain (by which he 
meant me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) 
had saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt 
him ; and as for the maid, he was sure if she came 
to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us 
carry them whither we would. The sui^eon repre- 
sented the case so affectionately to me, that I 
yielded, and we took them both on board with all 
their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sug^r, which 
could not be removed, or come at ; and as the youth 
had a bill of lading for them, I made his commander 
sign a writing, obliging him to go, as soon as he 
came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, 
to whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver 
a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he 
had belonging to the deceased widow ; which I sup- 
pose was not done ; for I could never learn that the 
ship came to Bristol ; but was, as is most probable, 
lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and so 
far from any land, that I am of opinion, the first storm 
she met with afterwards she might founder in the sea ; 
for she was leaky, and had damage in her hold when 
I met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min., and 
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, 
though at first the winds had been contrary. I shall 
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, 
weather, currents, &c., on the rest of our voyage ; 
but, shortening my story for the sake of what is to 
follow, shall observe that I came to my old habita- 
tion, the island, on the loth of April 1695. It was 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, yj 

with no small difficulty that I found the place; for as 
I came to it, and went from it before, on the south 
and east side of the island, as coming from the 
Brazils ; so now coming in between the main and the 
island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any 
landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know 
whether I saw it or no. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore 
on several islands in the mouth of the great river 
Oroonoque, but none for my purpose : only this I 
learnt by my coasting the shore, that I was under 
one great mistake before, viz., that the continent 
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was 
really no continent, but a long island, or rather a ^ 
ridge of islands reaching from one to the other side 
of the extended mouth of that great river ; and that 
the savages who came to my island, were not 
properly those which we call Caribbees, but is- 
landers, and other barbarians of the same kind, who 
inhabited something nearer to our side than the 
rest. 

In short, I visited several of the islands to no 
purpose; some I found were inhabited, and some 
were not. On one of them I found some Spaniards, 
and thought they had lived there ; but speaking with 
them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek 
hard by, and that they came thither to make salt, 
and catch some pearl-mussels, if they could ; but 
they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay 
farther north, in the latitude of lo and 1 1 degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, some- 
times with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's 
shallop (which we had found a convenient boat, and 



38 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

therefore kept her with their -^^xy good will), at length 
I came fair on the south side of my island, and I 
presently knew the very countenance of the place ; 
so I brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside 
with the little creek where was my old habitation. 

As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, 
and asked him if he knew where he was ? He looked 
about a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried, 
'* Oh yes, oh there, oh yes, oh there I *' pointing to our 
old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering like 
a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him 
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the 
place. 

"Well, Friday," said I, "do you think we shall 
find anybody here, or no ? and what do you think, 
shall we see your father ? " The fellow stood mute as 
a stock a good while ; but when I named his father, 
the poor affectionate creature looked dejected ; and 
I could see the tears run down his face very plenti- 
fully. " What is the matter, Friday } " said I ; " are 
you troubled because you may see your father ? "— » 
"No, no," says he, shaking his head, "no see him 
more, no ever more see again.*' — *" Why so.^" said I, 
*' Friday, how do you know that ? " — " Oh no, oh no," 
says Friday, "he long ago die; long ago, he much 
old man."—" Well, well," said I, " Friday, you don't 
know: but shall we see any one else then?" The 
fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points 
just to the hill above my old house; and though we 
lay half a league off, he cries out, " Me see ! me see 1 
yes, yes, roe see much man there, and there, and 
there." I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not 
with a perspective-glass; which was, I suppose.

because I could ndt hit the place ; for the fellow was 
right, as I found lipon inquiry the next day^ and 
there were five or six men ail together stood to lodk 
at the ship, hot knowing what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I 
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired 
three guns, to give them notice we were friends ; and 
about half a quarter of an hour after we perceived a 
smoke rise from the side of the creek; so I imme- 
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me ; 
and hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce^ I 
went directly on shore, taking with me the young 
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole 
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and 
every particular both of myself and those that I left 
there, and who was on that account extremely desirous 
to go with me; We had besides about sixteen men 
very well armed, if we had found any new guest there 
which we did not know df j but we had lio heed of 
weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near 
high water, we rowed directly into the cfeek; and 
the first man I Ifixed my eye u|>dii was the Spatliard 
whose life I had saved^ and whom I knew by his 
face perfectly well ; as to his habit, I shall describe 
it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at 
first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in 
the boat ; for the affectionate creature had spied his 
father at a distance, a good way off of the Spaniards, 
where indeed I saw nothing of him ; and if they had 
not let him go on shore he would have jumped into 
the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew 
away to his father like an arrow dut of a bow. It 



40 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

would have made any man shed tears in spite of the 
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of 
this poor fellow's joy, when he came to his father ; 
how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, 
took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and 
lay down by him ; then stood and looked at him as 
any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter 
of an hour together ; then lay down upon the ground, 
and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got 
up again and stared at him ; one would have thought 
the fellow bewitched : but it would have made a dc^ 
laugh to see how the next day his passion ran out 
another way: in the morning he walked along the 
shore, to and again, with his father, several hours, 
always leading him by the hand as if he had been a 
lady ; and every now. and then would come to fetch 
something or other for him from the boat, either a 
lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit, or something or 
other that was good. In the afternoon his frolics ran 
another way; for then he would set the old man 
down upon the ground, and dance about him, and 
make a thousand antic postures and gestures ; and 
all the while he did this he would be talking to him, 
and telling him one story or another of his travels, 
and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert 
him. In short, if the same filial affection was to be 
found in Christians to their parents in our parts of 
the world, one would be tempted to say there hardly 
would have been any need of the fifth command- 
ment. 

But this is a digression : I return to my landing. 
It would be endless to take notice of all the cere- 
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received me 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

with. The first Spaniard whom, as I said, I knew 
very well, was he whose life I saved: he came to- 
wards the boat attended by one more, carrying a flag 
of truce also ; and he did! not only not know me at 
first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being 
me that was come till I spoke to him. '* Seignior," 
said I, in Portuguese, "do you not know me?" at 
which he spoke not a word ; but giving his musket 
to the man that was with him, threw his arms abroad, 
and saying something in Spanish that I did not 
perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, 
telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face 
again that he had once seen as of an angel from 
Heaven sent to save his life : he said abundance of 
very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard always 
knows how ; and then beckoning to the person that 
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. 
He then asked me if I would walk to my old habita- 
tion, where he would give me possession of my own 
house again, and where I should see there had been 
but mean improvements; so I walked along with 
him ; but, alas ! I could no more And the place again 
than if I had never been there ; for they had planted 
so many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so 
thick and close to one another, in ten years time they 
were grown so big, that, in short, the place was in- 
accessible, except by such windings and blind ways 
as they themselves only who made them could And. 

I asked them, what put them upon all these forti- 
fications ? He told me, I would say there was need 
enough of it, when they had given an account how 
they had passed their time since their arriving in the 
island, especially after they had the misfortune to 



1 



42 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

find that I was gone ; he told me he could not but 
have some Satisfaction in my good, fortune when he 
heard that I was gone in a good ship, and td my 
satisfaction ; and that he had oftentimes a strort^ 
persuasion that one time or other he should see^mt 
again : but nothing that evfer befell him in hij life; 
he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at 
first, as the disappointment he was under when he 
came back to the island and found I was not there; 

Ai to the three barbarians (so he called them) 
that were left behind, and of whom he said he had 
a long story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought 
themselves much better among the savages, only 
that their number was so small. "And," says he, 
"had they been strong enoughi we had been all 
long ago in purgatory;" and with that he crossed 
himself upon the breast. "But, sir," says he, "I 
hope yoil will not be displeased when I shall tell 
you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for 
our own preservation, to disarm them, and making 
them our subjects, who would not be content with 
being moderately our masters, but would be our 
murderers/' I answered, I was heartily afraid of 
it when I left them there ; and nothing troubled 
me at my parting from the island, but thsfct they 
were not come back, that I might have put them in 
possession of everything first, and left the other in 
a state of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they 
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and 
should be very far from finding any fault with it; 
for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungo- 
vernable villains, and were fit fof any manner df 
misehief. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

' While I was saying thisi came the man whom he 
had sent back, and with him eleven men more : ih 
the dress they were in it was impossible to guess 
what nation they were of; but he made all clear 
both to them and to me. First he turned to me» 
and pointing to them, said, *' These, sir> are some 
of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ; " and 
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let 
them know who I was; upon which they all camd 
up one by one, not as if they had been sailors and 
ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they 
had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch 
or a great conqueror: their behaviour was to the 
last degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed 
with a manly majestic gravity, which very well be- 
came them : and in short they had so much more 
manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive 
their civilities, much less how to return them in 
kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in^ 
the island after my going away is so remarkable, 
and has so many incidents, which the former part 
of my relation will help to understand, and which 
will, in most of the particulars, refer to that account 
I have already given, that I cannot but commit them 
with great delight to the reading of those that comd 
after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relatioti 
in the first person, which will put me to the expense 
of ten thousand Said Ts, and Said he's, and He told 
me's, and I told him's, and the like ; but I shall col^ 
kct the facts historically as near as I can gathei^ 
them qut of my memory from what they related to 



44 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

me, and from what I met with in my converging with 
them, and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly 
as I can, I must go back to the circumstance in 
which I left the island, and which the persons were 
in of whom I am to speak. At first it is necessary 
to repeat, th^t I had sent away Friday *s father and 
the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued 
from the savages ; I say, I had sent them away in 
a large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to 
fetch over the Spaniard's companions whom he had 
left behind him, in order to save them from the like 
calamity that he had been in, and in order to succour 
them for the present, and that if possible, we might 
together find some way for our deliverance afterward. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appear- 
ance of, or the least room to hope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before ; 
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after 
happened, I mean of an English ship coming on shore 
there to fetch them off; and it could not but be a 
very great surprise to them when they came back, 
not only to find that I was gone, but to find three 
strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had 
left behind me, which would otherwise have been 
their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, 
that I might begin where I left ofT, was of their own 
part; and I desired he would give me a particular 
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with 
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He 
told me there was little variety in that part ; for no- 
thing remarkable happened to them on the way, they

laving very calm weather and a smooth sea ; for his 
:ountryinen it could not be doubted, he said, but that 
hey were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the 
principal man among them, the captain of the vessel 
they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some 
time) ; they were, he said, the more surprised to see 
bim, because they knew that he was fallen into the 
bands of savages, who, they were satisfied, would 
devour him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners; 
that when he told them the story of the deliverance, 
and in what manner he was furnished for carrying 
them away, it was like a dream to them : and their 
astonishment, they said, was something like that of 
Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he was, 
and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh s 
court: but when he showed them the arms, the 
powder, the ball, and the provisions that he brought 
them for their journey or voyage, they were restored 
to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their 
deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away 
with him. 

The first business was to get canoes : and in this 
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the 
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly 
savages, and to borrow two large canoes or periaguas, 
on pretence of going out a-fishing or for pleasure. 

In these they came away the next morning; it 
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready, 
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, nor provi- 
sions, nor any other thing in the world but what they 
had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they 
used to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that 



46 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered 
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
lo get off from the island ; leaving three of the most 
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains 
behind me that any man could desire to meet with, 
to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment, 
you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when 
the Spaniards came on shore, they gave my letter to 
them, and gave them provisions and other relief, as I 
had ordered them to do; also they gave them the 
long paper of directions, which I had left with them, 
containing the particular methods which I took for 
mans^ing every part of my life there ; the way how 
I baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and 
planted my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my 
pots, and, in a word, everything I did ; all this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of 
whom understood English well enough ; nor did they 
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything 
else, for they agreed very well for some time : they 
gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave, 
sind they began to live very sociably ; and the head 
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my method, and 
Friday's father together, managed all their affairs ; for 
as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble 
about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises, and 
when they came home at night, the Spaniards pro- 
vided their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, 
woiild the other but have left them alone; which, 
however, they could not find in their hearts to do 
long : but, like the dog in the manger, they would 



OE ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

not eat themselves, and would not let others eat 
neither: the differences, nevertheless, were at first 
but trivial, and such as are not worth relating ; but 
at last it broke out into open war, and it began with 
all the rudeness and insolence that can be ima- 
gined, without reason, without provocation, contrary 
to nature, and indeed to common sense; and thought 
it is true, the first relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers, 
yet when I came to examine the fellows, they could 
not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, 
I must supply a defect in my former relation ; and 
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, 
that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, 
there happened a little quarrel on board our ship, 
which I was afraid once would turn to a second 
mutiny ; nor was it appes^sed till the captain, rousing 
up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance, 
parted them by force, and making two of the most 
refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons ; 
and as they had been active in the former disorders, 
and let fall some ugly dangerous words the second 
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England, 
and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running 
away with the ship. 

This, it seems, though the captain did not intend 
to do it, frighted some other ipen in the ship; and 
some of them had put it in the heads of the rest, that 
the captain only gave them good words for the pre- 
sent till they should come to some English port, and 
that then they should be all put into a gaol, and 
tried for their lives. 



48 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it ; upon which it was desired that I, who still 
passed for a great man among them, should go down 
with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell them, 
that they might be assured, if they behaved well the 
rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time 
past should be pardoned. So I went, and after pass- 
ing my honour's word to them, they appeared easy, 
and the more so, when I caused the two men who 
were in irons to be released and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for 
that night, the wind also falling calm. Next morn- 
ing we found that our two men, who had been laid 
in irons, had stole each of them a musket and some 
other weapons; what powder or shot they had we 
knew not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which 
was not yet hauled up, and run away with her to 
their companions in roguery on shore. 

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat 
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away 
they went to seek the rogues; but they could neither 
find them, nor any of the rest ; for they all fled into 
the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. 
The mate was once resolved, in justice to their 
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt 
all their household stuff and furniture, and left them 
to shift without it ; but having no order, he let all 
alone, left everything as they found it, and bringing 
the pinnace away, came on board without them. 

These two men made their number five ; but the 
other three villains were so much wickeder than 
these, that after they had been two or three days 
together, they turned their two new-comers out of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

doors to shift for themselves, and would have nothing 
to do with them ; nor could they, for a good while, 
be persuaded to give them any food; as for the 
Spaniards, they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi- 
ness began to go forward ; the Spaniards would have 
persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in 
their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they 
might be all one family; but they would not hear of 
it : so the two poor fellows lived by themselves, and 
finding nothing but industry and application would 
make them live comfortable, they pitched their tents 
on the north shore of the island, but a little more to 
the west, to be out of the danger of the savages, who 
always landed on the east parts of the island. 

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and the 
other to lay up their magazines and stores in ; and 
the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, 
and especially some of the peas which I had left 
them, they dug and planted, and enclosed, after the 
pattern I had set for them all, and began to live 
pretty well : their first crop of corn was on the 
ground, and though it was but a little bit of land 
which they had dug up at first, having had but a 
little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and 
find them with bread or other eatables ; and one of 
the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was 
very ready at making soup, puddings, and such other 
preparations, as the rice and the milk and such little 
flesh as they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving posture, 
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country- 
men too, ia mere humour, and to insult them, came

ai^ 4)ullied them^ aod lold them the island iwas 
theirs ; that the gavernoir, meaoincr me, bad givea 
them pp^session pf it, and aobody e)se had any light 
to it ; and, damn them, they should build no bouses 
upon tbieir groiind^ imkss they would pay them rent 
for them. 

The two m.en thought l^^jLey had jested at firsts and 
aslqed them to come aad sit down, and see what fine 
houses they were that they had built, and tell tiiem 
what reipt they demanded ; and one of them merrily 
told them, if they w^e ground-laadlords^ he hoped 
if they built tenements upon the lajid« and foade 
improvements, thisy would, according to the custom 
of all landlords, grant them a long lease; and bid 
them go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One 
of the three^ damning and raging, toid theoFi they 
should see they were not in jest ; and going to a 
little place at a distance, where the honest men had 
made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a fire- 
brand and claps it to the outside of their hut, and 
N^iy fairly set it on fire ; and it would have been all 
burnt down in a few minutes. If one of the two had 
not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the 
fire <out with his f^t, and that not without some 
difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's 
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a 
pole he bad in his hand ; and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the but, 
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing 
the dai\ger they were both in, ran in after him, and 
immediately they came both out with their muskets; 
lind tb^ inai that was first struck ^t with the pok 



OF Robinson CRLTsoE. ji 

kncyckcd the fellow down, who began the quarrel, 
with die stock of his musket, and that before the 
Other two could come to help hin^ ; and then seeing 
the rest came at th^em, they stood together, and pre- 
senting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade 
them stand offl 

The others had firearms with them too ; but one 
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and 
made desperate by his danger, told them if they 
offered to move hand or foot they were all dead men, 
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. 
They did not indeed lay down their arms ; but 
seeing him resolute, it brought them to a parley, 
and they consented to take their wounded man with 
them, and be gone ; and, indeed, it seems the fellow 
was wounded sufficiently with the blow: however, 
they were much in the wrong, since they had the 
advantage, that they did not disarm, them effectually, 
as they ntight have done, and have gone immediately 
to the Spaniards, and given them an account how 
the rogues had treated them ; for the three villains 
studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave 
them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the 
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down 
their corn, shooting three young kids and a she-goat, 
which the poor men had got to breed up tame for 
their store ; and in a word, plaguing them night and 
day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a 
cieftperation, that they resolved to fight them all three 
the first time they had a fair opportunity. In order 
to this they resolved to go to the castle, as they 
called it, that was my old dwelling, where the three 



( 



52 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at that 
time, intending to have a fair battle, and the Spa- 
niards should stand by to see fair play. So they got 
up in the morning before day, ^d came to the place, 
and called the EngUshmen by their names, telling a 
Spaniard that answered that they wanted to speak 
with them.

THE VANQUISHED PARTY SECURED BY THE SPANIARDS, 

It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, 
having been in the woods, had seen one of the two 
Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the honest 
men ; and he had made a sad complaint to the 
Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with 
from their three countrymen, and how they had 
ruined their plantation and destroyed their corn that 
they had laboured so hard to bring forward, and 
killed the milch-goat and their three kids, which was 
all they had provided for their sustenance ; and that 
if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not 
assist them again, they should be starved. When the 
Spaniards came home at night, and they were all at 
supper, he took the freedom to reprove the three 
Englishmen, though in gentle and mannerly terms, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

and asked thein how they could be so cruel, they 
being harmless inoffensive fellows, and that they were 
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their 
labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains 
to bring things to such perfection as they had ? 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, 
" What had they to do there ? That they came on 
^hore without leave, and that they should not plant 
or build upon the island; it was none of their 
ground." — ^" Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, 
•* Seignior Inglese, they must not starve." The Eng- 
lishman replied, like a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, 

** they might starve and be d d, they should not 

plant nor build in that place." — " But what must they 
do then. Seignior ? " says the Spaniard. Another of 
the brutes returned, " Do ! d — n them, they should 
be servants, and work for them." — ** But how can you 
expect that of them ? they are not bought with your 
money ; you have no right to make them servants." 
The Englishman answered, " The island was theirs, 
the governor had given it to them, and no man had 
anything to do there but themselves ; " and with that 
he swore by his Maker, that he would go and burn 
all their new huts; they should build none upon 
their land. 

" Why, Seignior," says the Spaniard, " by the same 
rule, we must be your servants too." " Ay," says the 
bold dog, " and so you shall too, before we have done 
with you;" mixing two or three G — d d — mme's in 
the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard 
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. How- 
ever, this little discourse had heated them : and start- 
ing up, one says to the other (I think it was he they 



54 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

called Will Atkins), " Come, Jack, let us go and have 
the other bru^h with them; we will demoH^ tibeir 
castle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no colony 
in our dominions." 

Upon this they were all trooping away, with- every 
man c^ guii, a, pistol, and a sword, and muttered some 
insolent things among themselves, of what they would 
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity* Qflfeffed ; 
l^ut the Spaniards, it seem^, did not so peifectly 
understand them as to know all the particulars ; only 
that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking 
the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went, or l^ow they bestowed their 
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not 
know ; but it seems they wandered about the country 
part of the night ; aad then lying down in the place 
which I used to call n)y bower, they were weary, and 
overslept themselves. The case was this: they had 
resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the poor 
men when they were asleep; and they acknowledged 
it afterwards, intending to set fire to their huts while 
they were in them, and either burn them la themi or 
murder them as they came out: and, as malice 
seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange they 
should not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon 
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one than- 
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very 
luckily for them ally that they were up and gone 
abroad before the bloody-minded, rogues came to; 
their huts.

out tb his comrades^ *'Ha I Jack, here's the nest; but 
d' — n them, tSie birds are fk>wn;" They mused awhH'e 
t<K think what 9Kou4d be the occasion of their bein^ 
gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently; that 
th« Spaniards had given ^em notice of it ; and with 
that the7 shook hands, and swore to^one another that 
they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon 
as they had mad^ this btoody bargain; they fell tb 
work with the poor menV habitation*; they did not 
set fire indeed to anything, butf they pulled down 
both their houses, and pulled them so limb* ftom 
limby that they left not the least stick stianding, or 
scarce' any sign on the ground where they stood ; 
they tore all t^eir little collected househoid-stuflP in 
pieces, and direw everything about in' such a manner, 
that the poor men found, afterward s^ some of tSieir 
things a mile off from* their habitation'; 

Whei^ they had done this, they pulled up' all the 
young trees* which the poor men- had^ planted ; pulled 
up the enclosure they had mad^' to secure their cattle 
and t^eirdom; and, in a wordi sacked and^ plundered 
cveiything zas^ completfcly as a^ herd of Taitars would 
have don^ 

The two men> were sit this juncture gone to find 
them, out, and had resolved tb fight them wherever 
they had beenj though they were but t*wO' to tSiree : 
so that; had they met, thene certainly would- have 
been, bloodshed among them; for they were all^ very 
stbul^ resolute fellbws^ to give them their due. 

Bu& Providende took more care to' kecp' them- 
a8undbi\ than they themselves dould^ do to*meet- : for, 
as>tiiQe had dodged one another, wHen the three were' 
gone thither^ the fw<r were here;' a^d^after^Vards When 



56 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the two went back to find them, the three were come 
to the old habitation again : we shall see their differ- 
ing conduct presently. When the three came back, 
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which 
the work they had been about put them into, they 
came up to the Spaniards, and told them what they 
had done, by way of scoff and bravado ; and one of 
them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they 
had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his 
hat, as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl 
about, fleering in his face, says he to him, "And you, 
Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, 
if you do not mend your manners." The Spaniard, 
who though quite a civil man was as brave as a man 
could desire to be, and withal a strong well-made 
man^ looked steadily at him for a good while ; and 
then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely 
up to him, and with one blow of his fist knocked 
him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe ; at 
which one of the rogues, insolent as the first, fired his 
pistol at the Spaniard immediately: he missed his 
body indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, 
but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he 
bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard 
believe he was more hurt than he really was, and 
that put him into some heat, for before he acted all 
in a perfect calm ; but now resolving to go through 
with his work, he stooped and took the fellow's musket 
whom he had knocked down, and was just going to 
shoot the man who had fired at him, when the rest 
of the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and 
calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured 
the other two, and took their arnas from them. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 57 

When they wefe thus disarmed, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well 
as their own countrymen, they began to cool ; and 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had 
their arms s^ain ; but the Spaniards, considering the 
feud that was between them and the other two 
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method 
they could take to keep them from one another, told 
them they would do them no harm : and if they 
would live peaceably they would be very willing to 
assist and associate with them, as they did before ; 
but that they could not think of giving them their 
arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do 
mischief with them to their own countrymen, and 
had even threatened them all to make them their 
servants. 

The rogues were now more capable to hear reason 
than to act reason ; but being refused their arms, 
they went raving away, and raging like madmen, 
threatening what they would do, though they had 
no firearms ; but the Spaniards, despising their 
threatening, told them they should take care how 
they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle ; 
for if they did, they would shoot them, as they 
would do ravenous beasts, wherever they found 
them ; and if they fell into their hands alive, they 
would certainly be hanged. However, this was far 
from cooling them; but away they went, swearing 
and raging like furies of hell. As soon as they 
fvere gone, came back the two men in passion and 
rage enough also, though of another kind ; for, 
liaving^ been at their plantation, and finding it all 
iemolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily 



58 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

be supposed they had provocation enough ; they 
could scarce have room to teli their tal«, the 
Spaniards wei^e so eager to tell th«m tiieirs; and it 
was strange enough to And^ that three vnc» should 
tilus bully mneteen* and* rtttdvr no puttbhmeiYt at 
ffU: 

The' Spaniard\5, indeed; despised tiYetn^ and- espe- 
cially having thus disarmed them^ made ligh« of their 
threatenitigs ; but the two Englishmenr resolved to 
have their remedy against them,, what paiiis so«vev i€ 
cost to find' them out. 

But the Spaniards interposed here tt>o, and told 
themj that they were already disarmed : they could 
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them 
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them : " Bur," said 
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, •^we 
Will endeavour to make them d^ you justice, if you 
will leave it to us ; for, as there is no* doubt but 
they will come to us again' when their passion is 
over, being not able to subsbt without our assist^ 
ance, we promise you to make no> peace with thetn^ 
without having a full satisfaction- for you.; and upon 
this condition we hope you will promise Oo* use no 
violence with them, other than in your defence." 

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awk- 
wardly and with great reluctance ;. but Uie Spaniards 
protested they did it only to* keep them from blbod- 
shed, and to make all easy at last : '* For>" said they, 
" we are not so many of us ; here is room enough' for 
us all, and' it is a great pity we should not be all good 
friends." At length* they did consent, and- waited for 
the issue of the thing, living (br some days^ with« the 
Spaniards; for their own habitation was* destioywi; 



OF R asms ON crusoe. 59 

. In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired 
with waadering, and almost starved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs aH that while, 
came back to the grove ; and finding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two more 
with kii», walking l^ the side of the creek; they 
caaie up in a very submissive humble manner, and 
begged to be received again into the family. The 
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they bad 
acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and so 
very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could 
not come to any conclusion without consulting the 
two Englishmen and the rest; but however they 
would go to thenr, and discourse about it, and they 
should know in half ao: hour. It may be guessed 
that they were very hard put to it ; for it seems^ as 
they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they 
begged he would send them out some bread in the 
meantime; which he did, and sent them' at the same 
time a lai^e piece of goat's flesh, and a. broiled parrot, 
which they ate very heartily, for they were hungry 
enough. 

After half an hour's consultationr they were called 
in, and a long debate- had about thenr, their two 
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their 
labour, and a design to murder them; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now ; 
upon the whole, the Spaniards: acted tdie moderators 
between thenx; and as they had obliged the two 
Eoglishmen not \x> hurt the three, while they were 
naked and unarmed,, so they now obliged the three 
togo-aod rebuild tbeit fellows' two huts^ one* to be 
of the 93n» dimensions, and the other larger than; 



A 



6o THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

they were before ; also to fence their ground again, 
where they had pulled up the fences, plant trees in 
the room of those pulled up, dig up the land agam 
for planting corn^ where they had spoiled it ; and, in 
a word, to restore everything in the same state as 
they found it, as near as they could ; for entirely it 
could not be, the season for the corn, and the growth 
of the trees and hedges, not being possible to be 
recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this : and as they had 
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they 
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to 
live pleasantly and agreeably together again ; only 
that these three fellows could never be persuaded to 
work; I mean, not for themselves except now and 
then a little, just as they pleased ; however, the 
Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but 
live sociably and friendly together, and study in the 
whole the good of the plantation, they would be con- 
tent to work for them, and let them walk about and 
be as idle as they pleased; and thus having lived 
pretty well together for a month or two, the Spaniards 
gave them their arms again, and gave them liberty to 
go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began 
to be as insolent and troublesome as before; but 
however, an accident happened presently upon this 
which endangered the safety of them all ; they were 
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look 
to the preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spaniard governor, 
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6i 

I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or 
governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in 
the night, and could by no means get any sleep ; he 
was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, 
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran 
upon men fighting, and killing one another, but was 
broad awake, and could not by any means get any 
sleep; in short, he lay a great while; but growing 
more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise : as they 
lay, being so many of them, upon goatskins laid 
thick upon such couches and pads as they made for 
themselves, and not in hammocks and ship-beds, as 
I did, who was but one, so they had little to do, 
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon 
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, 
and their pumps, and they were ready for going any 
way that their thoughts guided them. 

Being thus gotten up, he looked out ; but, being 
dark, he could see little or nothing ; and besides, the 
trees which I had planted, as in my former account 
is described, and which were now grown tall, inter* 
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and 
see that it was a clear starlight night; and, hearing 
no noise, he returned and laid him down again; but 
it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he comr 
pose himself to anything like rest, but his thought^ 
were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew not 
for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking 
about, going out and coming in, another of them 
waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was up ? 
The governor told him how it had been with him. 
"Say you 30?" says the other Spaniard; "such 



^2 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

tfaingfi are not to be slighted, I assure you; there 
is certamiy some mischief working/' says be, '^near 
tts;" and presently he asked him, "Where are the 
Englishmen?" — "They are all in their huts," says 
he, ^safe enough." It seems the Spaniards had 
kept possession of the main apartment, and had 
made a place, where the three Englishmen, since 
their last mutiny, ahva)^ quartered by themselves, 
and could not come at the rest. " Well," says the 
Spaniard, ''there is something in it, I am persuaded 
from my own experience ; I am satisfied our spirits 
embodied have converse with, and receive intelli- 
gence from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting 
the invisible world ; and this friendly notice is given 
for our advantage, if we know how to make use of it 
Come," says he, "let us go out and look abroad; 
and if we find nothing at all in it to justify our 
trouble, V\\ tell you a story to the purpose, that shall 
convince you of the justice of my proposing it." 

In a word, they went out to go to the top of the 
hill where I used to go ; but they, being strong, and 
in good company, nor alone, as I was, used none of 
my cautions to go up by the ladder, and then pulling 
it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, 
but were going round through the grove unconcerned 
and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a 
light as of fire, a very little way oflf from them, and 
hearing the voices of men, not of one, or two, but of 
a great number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages 
landing on the island, it was my constant care to 
prevent them making the least discovery of there 
being any inhabitant upon the ^place ; and when by 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. (>i 

any neoesskjr they came to Viyom it, tbey felt it so 
dEoctuaJly, that they that got away were scarce able 
to give any account of it, ibr we disappeared as soon 
as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me esca^pe 
to tell any one else, except it were the three savages 
ifl otur last encounter, who jumped into the boat, of 
whom I mentioned that I was afraid they should 
go home and bring more help. 

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of 
those men, that so great a number came now to- 
gether ; or whether they came ignorantly, and by 
accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards 
could not, it seems, understand : but whatever it 
was, it had been their business;, either to have con- 
cealed theoniselyes, and not have seen them at all; 
much less to have let the savages have €een that 
there were any inhabitants in the place ; but to have 
iallen upon them £0 effectually, as that not a man of 
them should have escaped, which could only have 
been by getting in between them and their boats : 
hut this presence of mind was wanting to them ; 
which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great 
while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor, and the 
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back 
immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an 
account of the imminent danger they were all in ; 
and they again as readily took the alarm ; but it was 
impossible to persuade them to stay close within 
where they were, but that they must all run out to 
see how things stood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to 



64 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

view them by the light of three fires they hsld made 
at some distance from one another; what they were 
doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they 
knew not ; for, first, the enemy were too many ; and, 
secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided 
into several parties, and were on shore in several 
places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at 
this sight: and as they found that the fellows ran 
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt 
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place where 
they would see the tokens of inhabitants ; and they 
were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock 
of goats, which would have been little less than 
starving them, if they should have been destroyed ; 
so the first thing they resolved upon was to de- 
spatch three men away before it was light, viz., two 
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the 
goats away to the great valley where the cave was, 
and, if need were, to drive them into the very cave 
itself. 

Could they have seen the savages all together in 
one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they 
resolved, if there had been a hundred of them, to 
have attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, 
for there were some of them two miles off from the 
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course 
they should take, and beaten their brains in con- 
sidering their present circumstances, they resolved 
at last, while it was dark,, to send the old savage 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 65 

(Friday's father) out as a spy, to learn if possible 
something concerning them, as what they came for, 
and what they intended to do, and the like. The 
old man readily undertook it, and stripping himself 
quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he 
went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he 
brings word that he had been among them undis- 
covered, that he found they were two parties, and of 
two several nations, who had war with one another, 
and had had a great battle in their own country, and 
that both sides having had several prisoners taken 
in the fight, they were by mere chance landed in 
the same island for the devouring their prisoners, 
and making merry ; but their coming so by chance 
to the same place had spoiled all their mirth ; that 
they were in a great rage at one another, and were 
so near, that he believed they would fight again as 
soon as daylight began to appear; but he did not 
perceive that they had any notion of anybody's 
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly 
made an end of telling the story, when they could 
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that 
the two little armies were engaged in a bloody 
fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to 
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen : he 
told them their safety consisted in it, and that they had 
nothing to do but to lie still, and the savages would 
kill one another to their hands, and the rest would go 
away ; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible 
to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen, their 
curiosity was so importunate upon their prudentials, 
that they must run out and see the battle ; however, 

VOL. II. E 



66 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they used some caution, viz., they did not go openly 
just by their own dwelling, but went further into the 
woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where 
they might securely see them manage the fight, and, 
as they thought, not to be seen by them ; but it 
seems the savages did see them, as we shall find here- 
after. 

The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive 
that some of them were men of great bravery, of 
invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the 
fight The battle, they said, held two hours before 
they could guess which party would be beaten ; but 
then that party which was nearest our people's habita- 
tion began to appear weakest, and after some time 
more, some of them began to fly ; and this put our 
men again into a great consternation, lest any of 
those that fled should run into the grove before their 
dwelling for shelter, and thereby involuntarily dis- 
cover the place, and that by consequence the pursuers 
should do the like in search for them. Upon this 
they resolved, that they would stand armed within 
the wall, and whoever came into the grove they should 
sally out over the wall, and kill them, so that if pos- 
sible not one should return to give an account of it ; 
they ordered also that it should be done with their 
swords, or by knocking them down with the stock of 
the musket, not by shooting them, for fear of raising 
an alarm by the noise. 

As they expected it fell out : three of the routed 
army fled for life : and crossing the creek ran directly 
into the place, not in the least knowing whither they 
went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. 



OF ROBIKSQN CRUSOE. 67 

The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of 
this within, with this addition to our inen*s great 
satisfaction, viz., that the conquerors had not pursued 
them, or seen which way they were gone. Upon this 
the Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would 
not suffer them to kill the three fugitives ; but send- 
ing three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them 
to go round and come in behind them, surprise and 
take them prisoners ; which was done : the residue of 
the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off 
to sea : the victors retired, and made no pursuit, or 
very little, but drawing themselves into a body 
together, gave two great screaming shouts, which they 
supposed were by way of triumph, and so the fight 
ended ; and the same day, about three o'clock in the 
afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And 
thus the Spaniards had their island again free to them- 
selves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages 
for several years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out 
of their den, and viewing the field of battle, they 
found about two-and-thirty dead men upon the spot ; 
some were killed with great long arrows, several of 
which were found sticking in their bodies, but most 
of them were killed with their great wooden swords, 
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field 
of battle, and as many bows, with a great many 
arrows. These swords were great unwieldy things, 
and they must be very strong men that used them ; 
most of those men that were killed with them had 
their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as 
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and 
several of their arms and legs broken; so that it is 



68 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury. 
They found not one wounded man that was not stone 
dead; for either they stay by their enemy till they 
have quite killed him, or they carry all the wounded 
men, that are not quite dead, away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great 
while; the sight had filled them with horror, and 
the consequence appeared terrible to the last degree, 
especially upon supposing that some time or other 
they should fall into the hands of those creatures, 
who would not only kill them as enemies, but kill 
them for food as we kill our cattle. And they pro- 
fessed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up 
like beef or mutton, though it was supposed it was 
not to be till they were dead, had something in it 
so horrible, that it nauseated their very stomachs, 
made them sick when they thought of it, and filled 
their minds with unusual terror, that they were not 
themselves for some weeks after. 

This, as I said, tamed even the three English 
brutes I have been speaking of, and for a great while 
after they were very tractable, and went about the 
common business of the whole society well enough ; 
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all natural- 
ised to the country; but some time after this they 
fell all into such simple measures again as brougiit 
them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed ; 
and these three being lusty stout young fellows, they 
made them servants and taught them to work for 
them ; and as slaves they did well enough ; but they 
did not take their measures with them as I did by 
mj man Friday, viz., to begin with them upon the 



QF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6^ 

principle of having saved their lives, and then in- 
structed them in the rational principles of life, much 
less of religion, civilising and reducing them by kind 
usage and affectionate arguings ; but as they gave 
them their food every day, so they gave them their 
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery 
enough ; but they failed in this by it, that they never 
had them to assist them and fight for them as I bad 
my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very 
flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part: being all now 
good friends (for common danger, as I said above, 
had effectually reconciled them), they began to con- 
sider their general circumstances; and the first thing 
that came under their consideration was, whether, 
seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of 
the island, and that there were more remote and 
retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of 
living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should 
not rather remove their habitation, and plant in some 
more proper place for their safety, and especially for 
the security of their cattle and corn. 

Upon this, after Jong debate, it was conceived that 
they should not remove their habitation, because 
that some time or other they thought they might 
hear from their governor again, meaniag me; and 
if I should send any one to seek them, I would be 
sure to direct them on that side, where if they should 
find the place demolished, they would conclude the 
savages had killed us all, and we were gone, and so 
our supply would go away too. 

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed ta 
remove them into the valley where my cave was. 



i 



70 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

where the land was as proper to both, and where 
indeed there was land enough ; however, upon second 
thoughts, they altered one part of that resolution too, 
and resolved only to remove part of their cattle 
thither, and plant part of their corn there ; and so, if 
one part was destroyed, the other might be saved; 
and one piece of prudence they used, which it was 
very well they did; viz., that they never trusted 
these three savages, which they had taken prisoners, 
with knowing anything of the plantation they had 
made in that valley, or of any cattle they had there ; 
much less of the cave there, which they kept in case 
of necessity as a safe retreat ; and thither they carried 
also the two barrels of powder which I had left them 
at my coming away. 

But however they resolved not to change their 
habitation ; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully 
covered it first with a wall and fortification, and 
then with a grove of trees; so seeing their safety 
consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which 
they were now fully convinced, they set to work, to 
cover and conceal the place yet more effectually 
than before ; to this purpose, as I had planted trees 
(or rather thrust in stakes which in time all grew 
to be trees) for some good distance before the en- 
trance into my apartment, they went on in the same 
manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space 
of ground, from the trees I had set quite down to 
the side of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my 
floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide 
flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land* 
©r any sign that there had been any landing there- 
about. These stakes also being of a wood very 



OF ROBINSOS CRUSOE, 71 

forward to grow, as I had noted formerly, they took 
care to have generally very much larger and taller 
than those which I had planted, and placed them 
so very thick and close, that when they had been 
three or four years grown, there was no piercing 
with the eye any considerable way into the planta- 
tion. As for that part which I had planted, the 
trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh; and 
among them they placed so many other short ones» 
and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a palisado a 
quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible 
to penetrate it but with a little army to cut it all 
down ; for a little dog could hardly get between the 
trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all; for they did the same by 
all the ground to the right hand, and to the left, 
and round even to the top of the hill, leaving no 
way, not so much as for themselves to come out, 
but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, 
and then lifted up and placed again from the first 
stage up to the top ; which ladder, when it was taken 
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to 
assist it, could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it 
less than what they afterwards found occasion for; 
which served to convince me, that as human pru- 
dence has authority of Providence to justify it, so 
it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to set 
it to work, and, would we listen carefully to the 
voice of it, I am fully persuaded we might prevent 
many of the disasters which our lives are now by our 
own negligence subjected to : but this by the way. 

I return to the story: they lived two years after 



iz THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits 
from the savages ; they had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them in a great con- 
sternation : for some of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the west side, or rather end of 
the island, which, by the way, was that end where 
I never went for fear of being discovered, they were 
surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians 
just coming on shore. 

They made the best of their way home in hurry 
enough, and giving the alarm to their comrades, they 
kept close all that day and the next, going out only 
at night to make observation ; but they had the good 
luck to be mistaken, for wherever the savages went, 
they did not land at that time on the island, but 
pursued some other design.

And now they had another broil with the three 
Englishmen, one of which, a most turbulent fellow. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

being in a rage at one of the three slaves which I 
mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had 
not done something right which he bid him do, and 
seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew 
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he bore it bv 
his side, and fell upon him, the poor savage, not to 
correct him but to kill him. One of the Spaniards 
who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous 
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, 
but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he 
had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and 
entreating him not to murder the poor man, clapped 
in between him and the savage to prevent the mis- 
chief. 

The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck 
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would 
serve him as he intended to serve the savage ; which 
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with 
a shovel which he had in his hand (for they were 
working in the field about the corn-land), knocked 
the brute down; another of the Englishmen running 
at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the 
Spaniard down, and then two Spaniards more came 
to help their man, and a third Englishman fell upon 
them. They had none of them any firearms, or 
any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, ex- 
cept the third Englishman ; he had one of my old 
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the last 
Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set 
the whole family in an uproar, and more help com- 
ing in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. 
The next question was, what should be done, with 
them ? they had been so often mutinous, and were 



74 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

so furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they 
knew not what course to take with them, for they 
were mischievous to the highest degree, and valued 
not what hurt they did any man; so that, in short, it 
was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard, who was governor, told them in so 
many words, that if they had been his own country- 
men he would have hanged them all; for all laws 
and all governors were to preserve society, and those 
who were dangerous to the society ought to be ex- 
pelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen, and 
that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman 
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, 
he would use them with all possible lenity, and would 
leave them to the judgment of the other two English- 
men, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and 
said they desired it might not be left to them ; ** For," 
says he, " I am sure we ought to sentence them to 
the gallows;" and with that gives an account how 
Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have 
all the five Englishmen join together, and murder all 
the Spaniards when they were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls 
to Will Atkins: "How, Seignior Atkins," says he, 
" will you murder us all ? What have you to say to 
that ?" That hardened villain was so far from deny- 
ing it, that he said it was true, and G — d d — mn 
him, they would do it still before they had done 
with them. "Well, but Seignior Atkins," said the 
Spaniard, " what have we done to you that you will 
kill us? And what would you get by killing us? 
And what must we do to prevent your killing us ? 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 75 

Must we kill you, or will you kill us ? Why will you 
put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" 
says the Spaniard, very calmly and smilingr. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's 
making a jest of it, that had he not been held by 
three men, and withal had no weapons with him, it 
was thought he would have attempted to have killed 
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This harebrained carriage obliged them to con- 
sider seriously what was to be done. The two 
Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the poor 
savage were of the opinion that they should hang 
one of the three for an example to the rest; and 
that particularly it should be he that had twice 
attempted to commit murder with his hatchet ; and 
indeed there was some reason to Jjelieve he had done 
it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable con- 
dition with the wound he had received, that it was 
thought he could not live. 

But the governor Spaniard still said, no, it was an 
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he 
would never consent to put an Englishman to death, 
though he had murdered half of them: nay, he said, 
if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and 
had time left to speak, it should be that they should 
pardon him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor 
Spaniard that there was no gainsaying it; and as 
merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where they 
are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it ; but 
then it was to be considered what should be done to 
keep them from the mischief they designed ; for all 
agreed, governor and all, that means were to be used 



76 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for preserving the society from danger. After a long 
debate it was agreed, first, that they should be dis- 
armed, and not permitted to have eithor gun, or 
powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon, and should 
be turned out of the society, and left to live where 
they would and how they could by themselves ; but 
that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, 
should converse with them, speak with them, or have 
anything to do with them ; that they should be for* 
bid to come within a certain distance of the place 
where the rest dwelt ; and that if they offered to 
commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or 
destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, 
or cattle belonging to the society, that they should 
die without mercy, and they would shoot them wher- 
ever they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing 
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it. and 
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, " Hold, 
you must reflect, that it will be long ere they can raise 
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not 
starve : we must therefore allow them provisions." 
So he caused to be added, that they should have a 
proportion of corn given them to last them eight 
months, and for seed to sow, by which time they 
might be supposed to raise some of their own ; that 
they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and 
six kids given them, as well for present subsistence 
as for a store ; and that they should have tools given 
them for their work in the field ; such as six hatchets, 
an axe, a saw, and the like; but they should have 
none of these tools or provisions unless they would 
swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

any of the Spaniards with them or of their fellow- 
Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned 
them out to shift for themselves. They went away 
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go 
away nor to stay ; but as there was no remedy they 
went, pretending to go and choose a place where 
they should settle themselves, to plant and live by 
themselves; and some provisions were given them, 
but no weapons. 

About four or five days after they came again for 
some victuals, and gave the governor an account 
where they had pitched their tents, and marked 
themselves out a habitation or plantation ; it was a 
very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part 
of the island, N.E., much about the place where I 
providentially landed in my first voyage when I was 
driven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whitlier, in 
my foolish attempt to surround the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, 
and contrived them in a mannner like my first habi- 
tation, being close under the side of a hill, havinir 
some trees growing already to the three sides of it ; 
so that by planting others it would be very easily 
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for. 
They desired some dry goat-skins for beds and cover- 
ing, which were given them; and upon their giving 
their words that they would not disturb the rest, or 
injure any of their plantations, they gave them 
hatchets, and what other tools they could spare; 
some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing, and in a 
word anything they wanted but arms and ammuni- 
tion. 



78 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

They lived in this separate condition about six 
months, and had got in their first harvest, though 
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they 
had planted being but little; for indeed having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
work upon their hands; and when they came to 
make boards, and pots, and such things, they were 
quite out of their element, and could make nothing 
of it ; and when the rainy season came on, for want 
of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their 
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling: 
and this humbled them much ; so they came and 
begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very 
readily did; and in four days worked a great hole 
in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure 
their corn and other things from the rain ; but it 
was but a poor place at best compared to mine; 
and especially as mine was then ; for the Spaniards 
had greatly enlarged it, and made several new 
apartments in it. 

About three-quarters of a year after this separa- 
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which, together 
with the former villany they had committed, brought 
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been 
the ruin of the whole colony. The three new asso- 
ciates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious 
life they led, and that without hope of bettering their 
circumstances; and a whim took them, that they 
would make a voyage to the continent from whence 
the savages came, and would try if they could not 
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, 
and bring them home, so as to make them do the 
laborious part of the work for them. J 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

The project was not so preposterous if they had 
gone no further; but they did nothing and proposed 
nothing, but had either mischief in the design, or 
mischief in the event; and if I may give my opinion, 
they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven ; for 
if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible 
crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things 
with divine justice? It was certainly an apparent 
vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that 
brought them to the state they were in ; and as they 
showed not the least remorse for the crime, but 
added new villanies to it, such as particularly that 
piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave 
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand 
to do what he was directed, and to wound him in 
such a manner as, no question, made him a cripple 
all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or 
medicine could be had for his cure ; and what was 
still worse, the murderous intent, or, to do justice 
to the crime, the intentional murder, for such to be 
sure it was, as was afterwards the formed design 
they all laid to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, 
and in their sleep. 

But I leave observing, and return to the story: 
the three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 
morning, and in very humble terms desired to be 
admitted to speak with them : the Spaniards very 
readily heard what they had to say, which was this, 
that they were tired of living in the manner they 
did, that they were not handy enough to make the 
necessaries they wanted, and that having no help, 
they found they should be starved ; but if the Spa- 
niards would give them leave to take one of the 



8o THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

canoes which they came over in, and give them arms 
and ammunition proportioned for their defence, they 
would go over to the main, and seek their fortune, 
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplyin^^ 
them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of 
them; but yet very honestly represented to them 
the certain destruction they were running into ; told 
them they had suffered such hardships upon that 
very spot, that they could, without any spirit of 
prophecy, tell them, that they would be starved or 
murdered, and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be 
starved if they stayed here, for they could not work, 
and would not work : and they could but be starved 
abroad; and if they were murdered, there was an end 
of them ; they had no wives or children to cry after 
them, and, in short, insisted importunately upon their 
demand, declaring that they would go, whether they 
would give them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that 
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like 
naked men, and be in no condition to defend them- 
selves, and that though they could ill spare their fire- 
arms, having not enough for themselves, yet they 
would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cut- 
lass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought 
sufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer; and having 
baked them bread enough to serve them a month 
and given them as much goat's flesh as they could 
eat while it was sweet, and a great basketful of 
dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8i 

kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a 
voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles 
broad. 

The boat was indeed a lai^e one, and would have 
very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and there- 
fore was rather too big for them to manage ; but as 
they had a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, 
they did well enough ; they had made a mast of a 
long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried 
which they had sewed or laced together ; and away 
they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called 
after them, "Bon veajo!" and no man ever thought 
of seeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often say to one another and 
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, 
how quietly and comfortably they lived now those 
three turbulent fellows were gone ; as for their ever 
coming again, that was the remotest thing from their 
thoughts that could be imagined ; when, behold, after 
twenty-two days' absence, one of the Englishmen 
being abroad upon his planting work, sees three 
strange men coming towards him at a distance, two 
of them with guns upon their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman as if he were be- 
witched, and came frighted and amazed to the gover- 
nor Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, 
for there were strangers landed upon the island, he 
could not tell who. The Spaniard, pausing a while, 
says to him, " How do you mean, you cannot tell 
who } They are savages, to be sure." " No, no," says 
the Englishman, ''they are men in clothes^ with 
arnjs." — " Nay, then," says the Spaniard, '* why are 
you concerned ? If they are not savages, they must 

VOL. II. F 



81 ' THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

be friends ; for there is no Christian nation upon earth 
but will do us good rather than harm." 

While they were debating thus, came the three 
Englishmen, and standing without the wood which 
was new-planted, hallooed to them ; they presently 
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind 
ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon 
another question, viz., What could be the matter, 
and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in ; 
and inquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing? they gave them a full account of 
their voyage in a few words, viz., that they reached 
the land in two days, or something less, but finding 
the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing 
with bows and arrows to fight them, they durst not 
go on shore, but sailed on to the northward six or 
seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by 
which they perceived that the land they saw from our 
island was not the main, but an island : that entering 
that opening of the sea, they saw another island on 
the right hand north, and several more west; and 
being resolved to land somewhere, they put over to 
one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on 
shore ; that they found the people were courteous and 
friendly to them, and they gave them several roots, 
and some dried Ash, and appeared very sociable : and 
the women, as well as the men, were very forward to 
supply them with anything they could get for them 
to eat, and brought it to them a great way upon their 
heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as 

well as they could of theni by signs, what nations 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

were fliis way, and that way; and were told of several 
fierce and terrible people that lived almost every 
way; who^ as they made known by signs to them, 
used to eat men; but as for themselves, they said, 
that they never ate men or women, except only such 
as they took in the wars ; and then they owned that 
they made a great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of 
that kind, and they told them two moons ago, point- 
ing to the moon, and then to two fingers ; and that 
their great king had two hundred prisoners now, 
which he had taken in his war, and they were feed- 
ing them to make them fat for the next feast. The 
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those 
prisoners ; but the others mistaking them, thought 
they were desirous to have some of them to carry 
away for their own eating. So they beckoned to 
them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to 
the rising, which was to signify that the next morning 
at sunrising they would bring some for them; and 
accordingly the next morning they brought down 
five women and eleven men, and gave them to the 
Englishmen to carry with them on their voyage, just 
as we w6uld bring so many cows and oxen down to 
a seaport town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at 
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they 
did not know what to do; to refuse the prisoners 
would have been the highest affront to the savage 
gentry that offered them ; and what to do with them 
th^y knew not; however, upon some debate, they 
resolved to accept of them; and in return they gave 
the savages that brought them one of their hatchets, 



84 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

an old key,, a knife, and six or seven of their bul- 
lets, which, though they did not understand, they 
seemed extremely pleased with; and then tying 
the poor creatures' hands behind them, they (the 
people) dragged the prisoners into the boat for our 
men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as 
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them 
this noble present would certainly have expected that 
they should have gone to work with them, have killed 
two or three of them the next morning, and perhaps 
have invited the donors to dinner. 

But having taken their leave with all the respect 
and thanks that could well pass between people, 
where, on either side, they understood not one word 
they could say, they put off with their boat, and 
came back towards the first island, where when they 
arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some 
communication with their prisoners, but it was im- 
possible to make them understand anything; nothing 
they could say to them, or give them, or do for them, 
but was looked upon as going about to murder them : 
they first of all unbound them, but the poor creatures 
screamed at that, especially the women, as if they 
had just felt the knife at their throats; for they im- 
mediately concluded they were unbound on purpose 
to be killed. 

If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same 
thing; then they concluded it was for fear they 
should sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough to 
kill ; if they looked at one of them more particularly. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8$ 

the party presently concluded it was to see whether 
he or she was fattest and fittest to kill first; nay, 
after they had brought them quite over, and began 
to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they 
expected every day to make a dinner or supper for 
their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unac-* 
countable history or journal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard asked them where their new family was ? 
And being told that they had brought them on 
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and 
were come to beg some victuals for them ; they (the 
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to 
say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down td the 
place and see them, and did so, and Friday's father 
with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat all 
bound; for when they had brought them on shore 
they bound their hands, that they might not take 
the boat and make their escape ; there, I say, they 
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three 
men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped, straight and 
fair limbs, about thirty or thirty-five years of age, 
and five women ; whereof two might be from thirty 
to forty, two more not above twenty-four or twenty- 
five, and the fifth a tall comely maiden about sixteen 
or seventeen. The women were well-favoured, agree- 
able persons, both in shape and features, only tawny; 
and two of them, had they been perfectly white, would 
have passed for handsome women even in London 
itself, having very pleasant agreeable countenances, 
and of a very modest behaviour, especially when 
they came afterwards to be clothed and dressed^ as 



86 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they called it, though that dress was very indifferent, 
it must be confessed ; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something un- 
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a 
just character) men of the best behaviour, of the most 
calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-humour that 
ever I met with ; and, in particular, of the utmost 
modesty, as will presently appear: I say the sight 
was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five 
naked women, all together bound, and in the most 
miserable circumstances that human nature could be 
supposed to be ; viz., to be expecting every moment 
to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked 
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed 
for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old 
Indian, Friday's father, to go in and see first if he 
knew any of them, and then if he understood any of 
their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he 
looked seriously at them, but knew none of them ; 
neither could any of them understand a word he 
3aid, or a sign he could make, except one of the 
women. 

However, this was enough to answer the end, which 
was to satisfy them, that the men into whose hands 
they were fallen were Christians ; that they abhorred 
eating of men or women, and that they might be 
sure they would not be killed. As soon as they were 
assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and by 
such awkward and several ways as is hard to describe, 
for it seems they were of several nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, 
in the next place, to ask them if they were willing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Zf 

be servants, and to work for the men who had 
)roiight them away to save their lives? At which 
hey all fell a-dancing; and presently one fell to 
aking up this, and another that, anything that lay 
icxt^ to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that 
they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women 
among them would presently be attended with some 
inconveniency, and might occasion some strife, and 
perhaps blood, asked the three men what they 
intended to do with these women, and how they 
intended to use them, whether as servants, or as 
women? One of the Englishmen answered very 
boldly and readily, that they would use them as 
both. To which the governor said, " I am not going 
to restrain you from it ; you are your own masters as 
to that: but this I think is but just, for avoiding 
disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it of 
you for that reason only, viz., that you will all engage, 
that if any of you take any of these women as a 
woman, or wife, he shall take but one ; and that, 
having taken one, none else shall touch her; for 
though we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but 
reasonable that while you stay here, the woman any 
of you takes should be maintained by the man that 
takes her, and should be his wife ; I mean," says 
he, *' while he continues here: and that none else 
should have anythmg to do with her/' All this 
appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without 
any difficulty* 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they 
designed to take any of thenu But every one an-» 
vwtxcdf ** l^Q '-" some of them said they ^ad wives . in 



88 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

Spain;' and the others did not like women that were 
not Christians; and altogether declared, that they 
would not touch one of them : which was an instance 
of such virtue as I have not met with in all my 
travels. On the other hand, to be short, the five 
Englishmen took them every one a wife ; that is to 
say, a temporary wife; and so they set up a new 
form of living ; for the Spaniards and Friday s father 
lived in my old habitation, which they had enlarged 
exceedingly within ; the three servants, which they 
had taken in the late battle of the savages, lived 
with them ; and these carried on the main part of 
the colony, supplying all the rest with food, and 
assisting them in anything as they could, or as they 
found necessity required. 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such 
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about 
these women, and that two of them should not pitch 
upon the same woman, especially seeing two or three 
of them were, without comparison, more agreeable 
than the others ; but they, took a good way enough 
to prevent quarrelling among themselves; for they 
set the five women by themselves in one of their 
huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew 
lots among them who should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by him- 
self to the hut where the poor naked creatures were, 
and fetched out her he chose; and it was worth 
observing, that he that chose first took her that 
was reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the 
five, which made mirth enough among the rest ; and 
even the Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow 
considered better than any of them^ that it was apph« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

eatioh and business that they were to expect assist- 
ance in as much as anything else, and she proved 
the best wife in the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves in a row 
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their 
condition returned upon them again, and they firmly 
believed that they were now going to be devoured : 
accordingly, when the English sailor came in and 
fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most la- 
mentable cry, and hung about her, and took their 
leave of her with such agonies and such affection as 
would have grieved the hardest heart in the world ; 
nor was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them 
that they were not to be immediately murdered, 
till they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who 
instantly let them know, that the five men who had 
fetched them out one by one, had chosen them for 
their wives. 

When they had done this, and the fright the women 
were in was a little over, the men went to work, and 
the Spaniards came and helped them'; and in a few 
hours they had built them every one a new hut or 
tent for their lodging apart ; for those they had 
already were crowded with their tools, household- 
stuff, and provisions. The three wicked ones had 
pitched furthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, 
but both on the north shore of the island, so that 
they continued separate as before : and thus my island 
was peopled in three places, and, as I might say, three 
towns were begun to be planted. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that as 
it often happens in the world (what the wise ends of 
God's providences are in such a disposition of things 



90 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two 
worst wives ; and the three reprobates that were 
scarce worth hanging, that were At for nothing, and 
neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor any 
one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and in- 
genious wives ; not that the two first were ill wives 
as to their temper or humour; for all the five were 
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjective creatures, 
rather like slaves than wives ; but my meaning is» 
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, 
or alike cleanly and neat 

Another observation I must make, to the honour 
of a diligent application on the one hand, and to the 
disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the 
other, that when I came to the place, and viewed 
the several improvements, planting, and management 
of the several little colonies, the two men had so far 
outgone the three that there was no comparison; 
they had indeed both of them as much ground laid 
out for com as they wanted ; and the reason was, 
because, according to my rule, nature dictated that 
it was to no purpose to sow more corn than they 
wanted ; but the difference of the cultivation, of the 
planting, of the fences, and indeed everything else, 
was easy to be seen at first view. 
. The two men had innumerable young trees planted 
about their huts, that when you came to the place 
nothing was to be seen but a wood ; and though they 
had their plantation twice demolished, once by their 
own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be 
shown in its place ; yet they had restored all again, 
and everything was flourishing and thriving about 
them ^ they had grapes planted vol order, and managed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 91 

like a vineyard, though they had themselves never 
seen anything of that kind ; and by their good order- 
ing their vines, their grapes were as good again as 
any of the others. They had also formed themselves 
a retreat in the thickest part of the woods, where, 
though there was not a natural cave, as I had found, 
yet they made one with incessant labour of their hands, 
and where, when the mischief which followed hap- 
pened, they secured their wives and children so as 
they could never be found ; they having, by sticking 
innumerable stakes and poles of the wood, which, as 
I said, grew so easily, made a grove impassable, ex- 
cept in one place, where they climbed up to get over 
the outside part, and then went in by ways of tlieir 
own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, 
though they were much civilised by their new settle- 
ment compared to what they were before, and were 
not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity, 
yet one of the certain companions of a profligate 
mind never left them, and that was their idleness. 
It is true, they planted corn and made fences; but 
Solomon's words were never better verified than in 
them : " I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and it 
was overgrown with thorns ; " for when the Spaniards 
came to view their crop they could not see it in some 
places for weeds; the hedge had several gaps in it, 
where the wild goats had gotten in and eaten up 
the com ; perhaps here and there a dead bush was 
crammed in to stop them out for the present, but it 
was only shutting the stable-door after the steed was 
stolen; whereas, when they looked on the colony of 
the other two, .there was the very face of industry 



92 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

and success upon all they did ; there was not a weed 
to be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their 
hedges ; and they, on the other hand, verified Solo* 
mon's words in another place: "The diligent hand 
maketh rich ; " for everything grew and thrived, and 
they had plenty within and without ; they had more 
tame cattle than the others, more utensils and neces- 
saries within doors, and yet more pleasure and 
diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors; and having learnt the 
English ways of dressing and cooking from one of 
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's 
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands* 
victuals very nicely; whereas the other could not 
be brought to understand it ; but then the husband, 
who, as I said, had been cook's mate, did it himself; 
but as for the husbands of the three wives, they 
loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish 
and birds ; in a word, anything but labour, and they 
fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and com- 
fortably; and the slothful lived hard and beggarly; 
and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over the 
world* 

But now I come to a scene different from all that 
had happened before, either to them or me; and the 
origin of the story was this : 

Early one morning there came on shore five or six 
canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which you 
please; and there is no room to doubt that they came 
upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves; 
but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, 
and to our men too, that they did not concern them-t 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

selves about it as I did ; but having been made 
sensible, by their experience, that their only business 
was to lie concealed, and that, if they were not seen 
by any of the savages, they would go off again 
quietly when their business was done, having as yet 
not the least notion of their being any inhabitants in 
the island ; I say, having been made sensible of this, 
they had nothing to do but to give notice to all the 
three plantations to keep within doors, and not to 
show themselves; only placing a scout in a proper 
place, to give notice when the boats went off to sea 
again. 

This was, without doubt, very right; but a dis- 
aster spoiled all these measures, and made it known 
among the savages, that there were inhabitants there, 
which was in the end the desolation of almost the 
whole colony. After the canoes with the savages 
were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, 
and some of them had the curiosity to go to the 
place where they had been to see what they had 
been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they 
found three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep 
upon the ground: it was supposed they had either 
been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like 
beasts, they were asleep, and would not stir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the 
woods, and did not come back in time to be taken 
in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, 
and perfectly at a loss what to do; the Spaniard 
governor, as it happened, was with them, and his 
advice was asked ; but he professed he knew not 
what to do ; as for slaves, they had enough already ; 



94 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES\ 

and as to killing them, they were none of them 
inclined to that The Spaniard governor told roe 
they could not think of shedding innocent blood ; for 
as to them, the poor creatures had done no wrong, 
invaded none of their property, and they thought 
they had no just quarrel against them to take away 
their lives. 

And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, 
observe, that let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty 
in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met 
with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any 
foreign country, who were so universally modest, 
temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so 
courteous as these Spaniards ; and as to cruelty, they 
had nothing of it in their very nature ; no inhumanity, 
no barbarity, no outrageous passions, and yet all of 
them men of great courage and spirit. 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their 
bearing the insufferable usage of the three English- 
men ; and their justice and humanity appeared now 
m the case of the savages as above. After some 
consultation they resolved upon this, that they would 
lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three 
men might be gone; but then the governor Spaniard 
recollected that the three savages had no boat ; and 
that if they were left to rove about the island, they 
would certainly discover that there were inhabitants 
in it, and so they should be undone that way. 

Upon this they went back again, and there lay 
the fellows fast asleep still ; so they resolved to 
awaken them, and take them prisoners; and they 
did so. The poor fellows were strangely frighted 
when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

like the women, that they should be murdered and 
eaten ; for it seems those people think all the world 
do as they do, eating men's flesh; but they were 
soon made easy as to that ; and away they carried 
them. 

It was very happy for them that they did not carry 
them home to their castle; I mean to my palace 
under the hill: but they carried them first to the 
bower, where was the chief of their country work : 
such as the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, 
&c ; and afterwards they carried them to the habi- 
tation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not 
much they had for them to do; and whether it 
was by negligence in guarding them, or that they 
thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I 
know not, but one of them ran away, and taking 
into the woods, they could never hear of him more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again 
soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages, 
who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, 
and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off 
again in two days' time. This thought terrified them 
exceedingly ; for they concluded, and that not with- 
out good cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe 
home among his comrades, he would certainly give 
them an account that there were people in the island, 
as also how weak and few they were; for this savage, 
as I observed before, had never been told, as it was 
very happy he had not, how many they were, 
or where they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard 
the iire of any of their guns, much less had they 
shown him any other of their retired places, such as 



96 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the 
two Englishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had 
giveii intelligence of them was, that about two months 
after this six canoes of savages, with about seven or 
eight or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the 
north side of the island, where they never used to 
come before, and landed about an hour after sun- 
rise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the 
habitation of the two Englishmen, where this escaped 
man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, 
had they been all there the damage would not have 
been so much, for not a man of them would have 
escaped : but the case differed now very much ; for 
two men to fifty were too much odds. The two men 
had the happiness to discover them about a league 
off, so that it was above an hour before they landed, 
and as they landed about a mile from their huts, it 
was some time before they could come at them. Now 
having great reason to believe that they were betrayed, 
the first thing they did was to bind the slaves which 
were left, and cause two of the three men whom they 
brought with the women, who, it seems, proved very 
faithful to them, to lead them with their two wives, 
and whatever they could carry away with them, to 
their retired place in the woods, w*hich I have spoken 
of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and 
foot till they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come 
on shore, and that they bent their course directly that 
way, they opened the fences where their milch-goats 
were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their goats 
to straggle into the wood, whither they pleased, that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

the savages might think they were all bred wild ; but 
the rogue who came with them was too cunniqg for 
that, and gave them an account of it all, for they 
went directly to the place. 

When the poor frighted men had secured their 
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had 
of the three, who came with the women, and who was 
at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with 
all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy 
help; and in the meantime they took their arms and 
what ammunition they had, and retreated towards 
the place in the wood where their wives were sent ; 
keeping at a distance, yet so that they might see, if 
possible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far but that, from a rising 
ground, they could see the little army of their ene-r 
mies come on directly to their habitation, and in a 
moment more could see all their huts and household 
stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortification ; for they had a very great loss, and to 
them irretrievable, at least for some time. They kept 
their station for a while, till they found the savages^ 
like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, 
rummaging every way and every place they could 
think of in search for prey, and in particular for the 
people, of whom it plainly appeared they had intel- 
ligence. 

The two Englishnien seeing this, thinking them- 
selves not secure where they stood, as it was likely 
some of the wild people might come that way, so 
they might come too many together, thought it pro- 
per to make another retreat about half a mile farther 

VOL. II. G 



98 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

believing, as it afterwards happened, that the farther 
they strolled, the fewer would be together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very 
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old 
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly 
large ; and in this tree they both took their standing, 
resolving to see what might offer. 

They had not stood there long, but two of the 
savages appeared running directly that way, as if 
they had already noticed where they stood, and were 
coming up to attack them ; and a little way farther 
they espied three more coming after them, and five 
more beyond them, all coming the same way; be- 
sides which, they saw seven or eight more at a dis- 
tance, running another way ; for, in a word, they ran 
every way, like sportsmen beating for their game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, 
whether they should stand and keep their posture, 
or fly; but after a very short debate with them- 
selves, they considered, that if the savages ranged 
the country thus, before help came, they might, per- 
haps, find out their retreat in the woods, and then 
all would be lost; so they resolved to stand them 
there ; and if there were too many to deal with, then 
they would get to the top of the tree, from whence 
they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, 
as long as their ammunition lasted, though all the 
savages that were landed, which were near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered 
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait for 
the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the two and the five that followed would be sepa- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

rated : at length they resolved to let the two first 
pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, 
and come to attack them. The two first savages 
also confirmed them in this resolution, by turning a 
little from them towards another part of the wood ; 
but the three, and the five after them, came for-^ 
wards directly to the tree, as if they had known the 
Englishmen were there. 

Seeing them come so straight towards them, they 
resolved to take them in a line as they came ; and as 
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the 
first shot might hit them all three ; to which purpose, 
the man who was to fire put three or four bullets into 
his piece, atid having a fair loop-hole, as it were, from 
a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without 
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty 
yards of tlie tree, so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages 
came on, they plainly saw that one of the three was 
the runaway savage that had escaped from them, 
and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved 
that, if possible, he should not escape, though they 
should both fire ; so the other stood ready with his 
piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he 
should be sure to have a second. 

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his 
aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, a little 
behind in a line, in a word he fired, and hit two of 
them directly; the foremost was killed outright; 
bcino- shot in the head; the second which was the 
runaway Indian, was shot through the body and fell, 
but was not quite dead ; and the third had a little 
scmtch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball 






100 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

that went through the body of the second ; and being 
dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt, sat down 
upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous 
manner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted with the 
noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at first ; 
for the woods made the sound a thousand times 
bigger than it really was ; the echoes rattling from 
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all 
parts, screaming and making, every sort, a several kind 
of noise, according to their kind, just as it was when I 
fired the first gun that, perhaps, was ever shot off in 
that place since it was an island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, 
till they came to that place where their companions 
lay, in a condition miserable enough ; and here the 
poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were 
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a 
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may 
be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be 
hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, told 
them that a fiash of fire first, and immediately after 
that thunder from their gods, had killed those two 
and wounded him. This, I say, is rational; for no- 
thing is more certain than that, as they saw no man 
near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their 
lives, or so much as heard of a gun ; neither knew 
they anything of killing or wounding at a distance 
with fire and bullets ; if they had, one might reason- 
ably beUeve that they would not have stood so un- 
concerned in viewing the fate of their fellows without 
some apprehension of their own. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. loi 

Our two men, though, as they eonfessed to me, it 
grieved thetn to be obliged to kill so many poor crea- 
tures, who at the same time had no notion of their 
danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, 
and the first having loaded his piece again, resolved 
to let fly both together among them, and singling out 
by agreement which to aim at, they shot together, 
and killed, or very much wounded, four of them : the 
fifth, frighted even to death, though not hurt, fell 
with the rest ; so that our men, seeing them all fall 
together, thought they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed made 
our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a 
wrong step, and they were under some surprise when 
they came to the place, and found no less than four 
of the men alive, and of them two very little hurt 
and one not at all : this obliged them to fall upon 
them with the stocks of their muskets ; and first they 
made sure of the runaway savage that had been the 
cause of all the mischief, and of another that was 
hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain. 
Then the man that was not hurt at all came and 
kneeled down to them with his two hands held up, 
and made piteous moan to them by gestures and 
signs for his life, but could not say one word to them 
that they could understand. 

However, they signified to him to sit down at the 
foot of a tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen, 
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great 
chance in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and 
his hands behind him, and there they left him ; and 
with what speed they could make after the other two 



102 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

which were gone before, fearing they, or any more 
of them, should find the way to their covered place 
in the woods, where their wives, and the few goods 
they had left, lay. They came once in sight of the 
two men, but it was at a great distance ; however 
they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a 
valley towards the sea, the quite contrary way from 
that which led to their retreat, which they were afraid 
of; and being satisfied with that, they went back to 
the tree where they left their prisoner, who as they 
supposed was delivered by his comrades ; for he was 
gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn with which 
they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the 
^ tree. 

They were now in as great a concern as before, 
not knowing what course to take, or how near the 
enemy might be, or in what numbers ; so they re- 
solved to go away to the place where their wives 
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them 
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure ; for 
though the savages were their own country-folks, yet 
they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps 
the more for the knowledge they had of thenL 

When they came thither, they found the savages 
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but 
had not found it ; for indeed it was inaccessible, by 
the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the 
persons seeking it had been directed by those that 
knew it, which these were not ; they found, therefore, 
everything very safe, only the women in a terrible 
fright. While they were here they had the comfort 
of seven of the Spaniards coming to their assistance : 
the other ten with their servants, and old Friday, I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

mean Friday '3 father, were gone in a body to defend 
their bower, and the corn and cattle that were kept 
there, in case the savages should have roved over to 
that side of the country ; but they did not spread so 
far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the 
savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly, 
and with them also came the savage whom the 
Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the 
tree ; for it seems they came that way, saw the 
slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth, 
and brought him along with them, where, however, 
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had 
done the two others who were left when the third 
ran away. 

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them ; 
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they 
thought they were under an absolute necessity to 
kill them for their own preservation : however, the 
Spaniard governor would not consent to it ; but or- 
dered that they should be sent out of the way to my 
old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with two 
Spaniards to guard them and give them food : which 
was done ; and they were bound there hand and foot 
for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen 
were so encouraged that they could not satisfy them- 
selves to stay any longer there ; but taking five of 
the Spaniards, and themselves, with four muskets 
and a pistol among them, and two stout quarter- 
staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first they came to the tree where the men lay 
that had been killed; but it was easy to see that 
some more of the savages bad been there; for they 



I04 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

attempted to carry their dead men away, and had 
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it 
over ; from thence they advanced to the first rising 
ground, where they had stood and seen their camp 
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still 
to see some of the smoke; but neither could they 
here see any of the savages : they then resolved, 
though with all possible caution, to go forward to- 
wards their ruined plantation; but a little before 
they came thither, coming in sight of the seashore, 
they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. 

They seemed sorry at first that there was no way 
to come at them to give them a parting blow ; but 
upon the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of 
them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and 
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed 
to come and help them to rebuild, and to assist them 
with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who 
were not yet noted for having the least inclination to 
do anything good, yet, as soon as they heard of it 
(for they, living remote, knew nothing till all was 
over), came and offered their help and assistance, and 
did very friendly work for several days to restore 
their habitations, and make necessaries for them; 
and thus in a little time they were set upon their legs 
again. 

About two days after this, they had the further 
.satisfaction of seeing three of the savages' canoes 
come driving on shore, and at some distance from 
them, with two drowned men; by which they had 
reason to believe that they had met with a storm at 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 105 

sea, which had overset some of them, for it blew very 
hard the night after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so on the other 
hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as 
well of what they had done, as of what happened to 
them : and to whet them on to another enterprise of 
the same nature, which they, it seems, resolved to 
attempt, with sufficient force to carry all before them ; 
for except what the first man had told them of inhabi- 
tants, they could say little to it of their own know- 
ledge ; for they never saw one man, and the fellow 
being killed that had affirmed it, they had no other 
witnesses to confirm it to them.

ACCOMMODATION. 

It was five or six months after this before they heard 
any more of the savages, in which time our men were 
ia hopes they had not forgot their former bad luck, 
or had given over the hopes of better; when on a 
sudden they were invaded with a most formidable 
fleet of no less than twenty-eight canoes, full of 



|o6 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, 
wooden swords, and such-like engines of war ; and 
they brought such numbers with them, that in short 
it put all our people into the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the 
easternmast side of the island, our men had that night 
to consult and consider what to do ; and in the first 
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed 
was their only safety before, and would much more 
be so now, while the number of their enemies was 
so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take 
down the huts which were built for the two English- 
men, and drive away their goats to the old cave; 
because they supposed the savages would go directly 
thither as soon as it was day, to play the old game 
over again, though they did not now land within two 
leagues of it. 

In the next place, they drove away all the flock 
of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, 
which belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in short, left 
as little appearance of inhabitants anyivhere as pos- 
sible ; and the next morning early they posted them- 
selves with all their force at the plantation of the two 
men, waiting for their coming. As they guessed, 
so it happened : these new invaders, leaving their 
canoes at the east end of the island, came ranging 
along the shore, directly towards the place, to the 
number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our men 
could judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but 
that which was worse, they had not arms for all their 
number neither : the whole account, it seems, stood 
thus : — first, as to men : 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

17 Spaniards. 
5 Englishmen. 

1 Old Friday, or Friday's father. 

3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved 

very faithful. 
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards. 

To arm these they had : 

II Muskets. 
5 Pistols. 
3 Fowling-pieces. 

5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces which were taken 
by me from the mutinous seamen whom I 
reduced. 

2 Swords. 

3 Old halberts. 

29 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or 
fusil, but they had every one a halbert, or a long staff, 
like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron fastened 
into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet ; also 
every one of our men had hatchets. Two of the 
women could not be prevailed upon but they would 
come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, 
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages 
when the first action happened, which I have spoken 
of, where the Indians fought with one another; and 
the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so 
often, commanded the whole; and Will Atkins, who, 
though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a most 



loS THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The 
savages came forward like lions, and our men, which 
was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in their 
situation ; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a 
most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just 
behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced 
guard, with orders to let the first of them pass by, 
and then fire into the middle of them ; and as soon 
as he had fired, to make his retreat as nimbly as he 
could, round a part of the wood, and so come in be- 
hind the Spaniards where they stood, having a thicket 
of trees all before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling 
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of order, 
and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him ; 
then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he 
orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their 
muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as 
big as large pistol-bullets. How many they killed 
or wounded they knew not ; but the consternation 
and surprise was inexpressible among the savages, 
who were frighted to the last degree, to hear such a 
dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others 
hurt, but see nobody that did it When in the 
middle of their fright, Will Atkins and his other 
three let fly again among the thickest of them ; and 
in less than a minute the first three, being loaded 
again, gave them a third volley. 

Had Will Atkins and his men retired imme- 
diately, as soon as they had fired, as they were or- 
dered to do, or had the rest of the body been at hand 
to have poured in their shot continually, the savages 
had been effectually routed ; for the terror that was 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

among them came principally from this, viz., that they 
were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, 
and could see nobody that hurt them : but Will 
Atkins staying to load again, discovered the cheat ; 
some of the savages, who were at a distance, spying 
them, came upon them behind ; and though Atkins 
and his men fired at them also, two or three times, 
and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they 
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed 
one of his fellow Englishmen with their arrows, as 
they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the 
Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave 
was a most gallant fellow, and fought most des- 
perately, killing five of them with his own hand, 
having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a 
hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, 
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground 
in the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three 
volleys upon them, retreated also ; for their number 
was so great, and they were so desperate, that though 
above fifty of them were killed, and more than so 
many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our 
men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a 
cloud ; and it was observed, that their wounded men, 
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous 
by their wounds, and fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englishman that were killed behind them ; 
and the savages, when they came up to them, killed 
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking 
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and 
wooden swords^ like true savages. But finding our 



no THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

men were gone, they did not seem inclined to pursue 
them, but drew themselves up in a kind of ring, 
which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted twice 
in token of their victory ; after which, they had the 
mortification to see several of their wounded men 
fall, dying with the mere loss of blood* 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, 
though he was wounded, would have had him march, , 
and charge them again altogether at once : but the 
Spaniard replied, "Seignior Atkins, you see how 
their wounded men fight ; let them alone till morn- 
ing; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore 
with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood, 
and so we shall have the fewer to engage." 

The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied 
merrily, '* That's true. Seignior, and so shall I too ; 
and thats the reason I would go on while I am 
warm." ** Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, 
"you have behaved gallantly, and done your part; 
we will fight for you, if you cannot come on; 
but I think it best to stay till morning:" so they 
waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they 
found the savages in great disorder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise 
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved 
to fall upon them in the night, especially if they 
could come to give them but one volley before they 
were discovered* This they had a fair opportunity 
to do; for one of the two Englishmen, in whose 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round 
between the woods and the seaside, westward, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 1 1 

turning short south, they came flo near where the 
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or 
heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did 
dreadful execution upon them ; in half a minute more 
eight others fired after them, pouring in their small 
shot in such a quantity, that abundance were killed 
and wounded ; and all this while they were not able 
to see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost 
expedition, and then divided themselves into three 
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them. altogether. 
They had in each body eight persons ; that is to say, 
twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men and the 
two women who, by the way, fought desperately* 

They divided the firearms equally in each party, 
and so of the halberts and staves. They would have 
had the women keep back ; but they said they were 
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus 
formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the 
enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. 
The savages stood all together, but were in the utmost 
confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting 
from three quarters together ; they would have fought 
if they bad seen us ; and as soon as we came near 
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor 
old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously. 
But our men gave them no time, but running up to 
them, fired among them three ways, and then fell 
in with the butt ends of their muskets, their swords, 
armed staves, and hatchets; and laid about them 
so well, that in a word they set up a dismal scream- 



XI2 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ing and howling, flying to save their lives which way 
soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution ; and killed, 
or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about one 
hundred and eighty of them ; the rest, being frighted 
out of their wits, scoured through the woods and 
over the hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble 
feet could help them to do ; and as we did not trouble 
ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together 
to the seaside, where they landed, and where their 
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end 
yet, for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening 
from the seaward, so that it was impossible for them 
to put off; nay, the storm continuing all night, when 
the tide came up their canoes were most of them 
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the 
shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off; 
and some of them were even dashed to pieces 
against the beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got 
little rest that night; but having refreshed them- 
selves as well as they could they resolved to march 
to that part of the island where the savages were 
fled, and see what posture they were in. This neces- 
sarily led them over the place where the fight had 
been, and where they found several of the poor 
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering 
life ; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds ; 
for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of 
battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his 
misery. 

However, there was no need to give any order in 
this case ;, for their own savages, who were their 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 1 3 

• - 

servants, despatched those poor creatures with their 

hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where 
the more miserable remains of the savages' army 
lay, where there appeared about one hundred still : 
their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, 
with their knees up towards their mouth, and the 
head put between the hands, leaning down upon the 
knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shot df 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets 
to be Ared without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, 
that by their countenance he might know, what to 
expect, viz., whether they were still in heart to fight', 
or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and dis- 
couraged, and so he might manage accordingly. 

This stratagem took ; for as soon as the savages 
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second, 
they started up upon their feet in the greatest con- 
sternation imaginable; and, as our men advanced 
swiftly towards them^ they all ran screaming and 
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which 
our men did not understand, and had never heard 
before ; and thus they rah up the hills into the 
country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but 
they did not then consider that this might probably 
have been the occasion of their coming again in such 
multitudes as not to be resisted ; or at least to come 
so many and so often, as would quite desolate the 
island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, 
who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with 

VOL. II. H 



114 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

them, proved the best counsellor in this case. His 
advice was, to take the advantage that oflfered, and 
clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive 
them of the capacity of ever returning any more to 
plague the island. 

They consulted long about this, and some were 
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly into 
the woods and live there desperate ; and so they 
should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid 
to stir about their businesS| and have their plantation 
continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, 
in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do 
with one hundred men than with one hundred nations; 
that, as they must destroy their boats, so they must 
destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed them- 
selves. In a word, he showed them the necessity of 
it so plainly, that they all came into it ; so they went 
to work immediately with the boats, and getting 
some dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried 
to set some of them on Are ; but they were so wet 
that they would scarce burn. However, the fire so 
burned the upper part, that it soon made them unfit 
for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians 
saw what they were about, some of them came run* 
ning out of the woods, and coming as near as they 
could to our men, kneeled down and cried, '^ Oa, Oa, 
Waramokoa," and some other words of their lan^ 
guage, which none of the others understood anything; 
of; but as they made pitiful gestures and strange 
noises, it was easy to understand they begged to have 
their boats spared, and that they would be gone, and 
never return thither again. 



OF KOBJNSON CRUSOE. . 115 

But our men were now satisfied, that they had no 
way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, 
but effectually to prevent any of these people from 
ever going home again ; depending upon this, that 
if ever so much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the story, the colony M^as undone ; so 
that, letting them know that they should not have 
any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and 
destroyed them every one that the storm had not 
destroyed before ; at the sight of which, the savages 
raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people 
heard plain enough ; after which they ran about the 
island like distracted men ; so that, in a word, our 
men did not really know at first what to do with 
them* 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, con*- 
sider» that while they made those people thus despe- 
rate, they ought to have kept good guard at the same 
time upon their plantations ; for though it is true they 
bad driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not 
find their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the 
hill, nor the cave in the valley ; yet they found out my 
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, 
and all the fences and planting about it ; trod all the 
corn under foot ; tore up the vines and grapes, being 
just then almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable 
damage, though to themselves not one farthingVworth 
of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all 
occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue 
ihem, ot hunt them up and down ; for as they were 
too nimble of foot for our men when they found them 
single, so pur men durst not go about single for fear 



ii6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of being surrounded with their numbers: the best 
was, they had no weapons ; for though they had bows, 
they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make 
any, nor had they any edged tool or weapon among 
them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to 
was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same 
time our men were also brought to very hard circum- 
stances by them ; for though their retreats were pre- 
served, yet their provision was destroyed, and their 
harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which way to 
turn themselves, they knew not ; the only refuge they 
had now was, the stock of cattle they had in the 
valley by the cave, aed some little corn which grew 
there. The three Englishmen, Will Atkins and his 
comrades, were now reduced to two, one of them 
being killecl by an arrow, which struck him on the side 
of his head, just under the temples, so that he never 
spoke more; and it was very remarkable, that this 
was the same barbarous fellow who cut the poor 
savage slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards 
intended to have murdered the Spaniards. 

I look upon their case to have been worse at this 
time than mine was at any time after I first dis- 
covered the grains of barley and rice, and got into 
the method of planting and raising my corn and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may say, a hun- 
dred wolves upon the island, which would devour 
everything they could come at, yet could be very 
hardly come at themselves. 

The first thing they concluded when they saw what 
their circumstances were, was, that they would, if 
possible, drive them up to the further part of the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

island, south-east, that if any more savages came on 
shore, they might not find one another; then that 
they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as 
many bf them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced the number; and if they could at last tame 
them, and bring them to anything, they would give 
them com, and teach them how to plant, and live 
upon their daily labour. 

In order to this they followed them, and so terrified 
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of 
them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, 
he would fall down for fear; and so dreadfully 
frighted they were, that they kept out of sight further 
and further, till at last our men following them, and 
every day almost killing and wounding some of them, 
they kept up in the woods and hollow places so much 
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want 
cf food ; and many were afterwards found dead in the 
woods, without any hurt, but merely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts 
relent, and pity moved them ; especially the Spaniard 
governor, who was the most gentleman-like, generous^ 
minded man that ever I met with in my life ; and he 
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as 
to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among 
them, and see if they might be brought to some con- 
ditions that might be depended upon, to save their 
lives, and do us no spoil. 

It was some time before any of them Could be 
taken ; but being weak, and half-starved, one of them 
was at last surprised, and made a prisoner : he was 
sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink ; but 



ii8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him« 
and no violence offered bitn> he at last grew tractable, 
and came to himself. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often 
with him, and told him how kind the others would 
be to them all ; that they would not only save their 
lives, but would give them a pait of the island to live 
in, provided they would give satisfaction ; that they 
should keep in their dwn bounds, and not come be- 
yond them, to injure of prejudice others; and that 
they should have corn given them, to plant and make 
it grow for their bread, and some bread given them for 
their present subsistence ; and old Friday bade the feU 
low go and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and 
hear what they said to it, assuring them^ that if they did 
not agree immediately, they should all be destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re- 
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with 
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have 
some food given them ; upon which twelve Spaniards 
and two Englishmen, well armed, and three Indian 
slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where 
they were; the three Indian slaves carried them a 
large quantity of bread, and some rice boiled up to 
cakes, and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and 
they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where 
they sat down, ate the provisions very thankfully, 
and were the most faithful fellows to their words that 
could be thought of; for except when they came to 
beg victuals and directions, they never came out of 
their bounds ; and there they lived when I came to 
the island, and I went to see thenu 
. They had taught them both to plant com, make 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 19 

bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they wanted 
nothing but wives, and they soon would have been a 
nation : they were confined to a neck of land sur- 
rounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain 
towards the sea before them, on the south-east corner 
of the island ; they had land enough, and it was very 
good and fruitful ; for they had a piece of land about 
a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles in 
length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, 
such as I made for myself; and gave among them 
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives ; and there 
they lived the most subjected innocent creatures that 
were ever heard of. 

After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity 
with respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, 
which was in about two years. Not but that now 
and then some canoes of savages came on shore for 
their triumphal, unnatural feasts ; but as they were 
of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of 
those that came before, or the reason of it, they did 
not make any search or inquiry after their country- 
men ; and if they had, it would have been very hard 
for them to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all 
that happened to them to my return, at least that 
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were 
wonderfully civilised by them, and they frequently 
went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death, any 
of the Indians coming to them, because they would 
not have their settlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets ; 



I20 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

but they soon outdid their masters; for they inad^ 
abundance of most ingenious things in wicker-work; 
particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves^ bird-cages, 
cupboards, &c., as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, 
couches, and abundance of other things, being very 
ingenious at such work when they were once put in 
the way of it 

My coming was a particular relief to these people^ 
because we furnished them with knives, scissors, 
spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all things of that kind 
which they could want. 

With the help of these tools they were so very 
handy, that they came at last to build up their huts, 
or houses, very handsomely ; raddling or working it 
up like basket-work all the way round, which was a 
very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
very odd ; but was an exceeding good fence, as well 
against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and our 
men were so taken with it, that they got the wild 
savages to come and do the like for them ; so that 
when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, 
they looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like 
bees in a hive ; and as for Will Atkins, who was now 
become a very industrious, necessary, and sober 
fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket- 
work as I believe was never seen. It was one hun- 
dred and twenty paces round on the outside, as I 
measured by my steps; the walls were as close 
worked as a basket, in panels or squares, thirty-two 
in number, and very strong, standing about seven 
feet high; in the middle was another not above 
twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, being 
eight-square in its form, and in the eight corners. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. j2f 

Stood eight very strong posts, round the top of 
which he laid strong pieces, joined together with 
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid be-r 
fore the roof, of eight rafters, very handsome, I assure 
you, and joined together very well, though he had no 
nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he had made; 
himself, too, out of the old iron that I had left there ; 
and indeed this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity 
ia several things which he had no knowledge of; he 
made himself a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows 
to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for his 
work, and he formed out of one of the iron crows a 
middling good anvil to hammer upon ; in this manner 
he made many things, but especially hooks, staples 
and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the 
house : after he pitched the roof of his innermost 
tent, he Worked it up between the rafters with basket- 
work, so firm, and thatched that over again so in- 
geniously with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf 
of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was 
as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed he 
owned that the savages made the basket-work for 
him. 

The outer circuit Was covered, as a lean to all 
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from 
the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner 
house, being about twenty feet distant; so that there 
was a space like a walk within the outer wicker wall, 
find without the inner, near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same 
wicker-worky but much fairer, and divided into six 
fipartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor, and 
put of QWQTy one pf these there was a door : first. 



122 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

into the entry, or coming into the main tent: and 
another door into the space or walk that was round it; 
so that this walk was also divided into six equal parts, 
which served not only for a retreat, but to store tip 
any necessaries which the family had occasion for. 
These six spaces not taking up the whole circum- 
ference, what otlier apartments the outer circle had 
were thus ordered : as soon as you were in at the 
door of the outer circle, you had a short passage 
straight before you to the door of the inner house ; 
but on either side was a wicker partition and a door 
in it, by which you went first into a large room or 
storehouse,^ twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet 
long, and through that into another, not quite so 
long : so that in the outer circle were ten handsome 
rooms, six of which were only to be come at through 
the apartments of the inner tent, and served as 
closets or retired rooms to the respective chambers 
of the inner circle; and four large warehouses or 
barns, or what you please to call them, which went 
in through one another, two on either hand of the 
passage that led through the outer door to the inner 
tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never 
seen in the world ; nor a house or tent so neatly 
contrived, much less so built In this great beehive 
lived the three families ; that is to say, Will Atkins 
and his companions; the third was killed, but his wife 
remained with three children ; for she was, it seems, 
big with dhild when he died, and the other two were 
not at all backward to give the widow her full share 
of everything, I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, 
&c, and when they killed a kid, or found, a turtle on 



OF ROBINSON CR USOE. 1 23 

the shore ; so that they all lived well enough^ though 
it was true, they were not so industrious as the other 
two, as has been observed already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that, 
as for religion, I don't know that there was anything 
of that kind among them ; they pretty often indeed 
put one another in mind that there was a God, by 
the very common method of seamen, viz., swearing 
by His name ; nor were their poor, ignorant, savage 
wives much the better for having been married to 
Christians, as we must call them ; for as they knew 
very little of God themselves, so they were utterly 
incapable of entering into any discourse with their 
wives about a God, or to talk anything to them con- 
cerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can 
' say the wives had made from them was, that they 
had taught them to speak English pretty well ; and 
all the children they had, which were near twenty in 
all, were taught to speak English too, from their 
first learning to speak^ though they at first spoke it 
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There 
were none of those children above six years old when 
I came thither; for it was not much above seven 
years that they had fetched these five savage ladies 
over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they 
had all children, more or less : I think the cook's mate's 
wife was big of her sixth child ; and the mothers were 
ail a good sort of welUgoverned, quiet, laborious 
women, modest and decent, helpful to one another, 
mighty observant and subject to their masters, I 
cannot call them husbands ; and wanted nothing but 
to be well instructed in the Christian religion, and to 



124 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

be legally married ; both which were happily brought 
^bout afterwards by my means, or at least by the 
consequence of my coming among them.

/ HOLt) CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPANIARDS^ AND LEARN

AND FEMALE INDIANS^ WHO HAD HITHERTO LIVED 
TOGETHER AS MAN AND WIFE. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five runagate English- 
men, I must say something of the Spaniards, who were 
the main body of the family, and in whose story there 
are some incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about 
their -circumstances when they were among the sa->- 
vages; they told me readily, that they had no in- 
stances to give of their application or ingenuity in 
that country : that they were a poor, miserable, 
dejected handful of people; that if means had been 
put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned 
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight 
of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but 
starving. One of them, a grave and very sensible 
man, told me he was convinced they were in the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125 

wrong ; that it was not the part of wise men to give 
tip themselves to their misery, but always to take 
hold of the helps which reason offered, as well for 
present support, as for future deliverance ; he told 
me that grief was the most senseless insignificant 
passion in the world, for that it regarded only things 
past, which were generally impossible to be recalled 
or to be remedied, but had no view to things to come, 
and had no share in anything that looked like deli- 
verance, but rather added to the affliction than pro- 
posed a remedy; and upon this he repeated a Spanish 
proverb, which though I cannot repeat in just the 
same words that he spoke it, yet I remember I made 
it into an English proverb of my own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He then ran on in remarks upon all the little im- 
provements I had made in my solitude; my un- 
wearied application, as he called it, and how I had 
made a condition which, in its circumstances, was at 
first much worse than theirs, a thousand times more 
happy than theirs was, even now when they were 
altogether. He told me it was remarkable that 
Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their 
distress than any people that ever he met with ; that 
their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were the 
worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes ; 
for that their first step in dangers, after common 
eflforts are over, was always to despair, lie down 
under it and die, without rousing their thoughts up 
to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine .differed exceed- 



136 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

jog^y; that they were cast upon the shore without 
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present 
sustenance, till they could provide it ; that it is true 
I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was 
alone; but then the supplies I had providentially 
thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving of 
the ship on shore, was such a help as would have 
encouraged any creature in the world to have applied 
himself as I had done. ^ Seignior," says the Spa- 
niard, " had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we 
should never have gotten half those things out of the 
ship as you did. Nay," says he, "we should never 
have found means to have gotten a raft to carry 
them, or to have gotten a raft on shore without boat 
or sail ; and how much less should we have done " 
said he, " if any of us had been alone ! " Well, I de- 
sired him to abate his compliment, and go on with the 
history of their coming on shore, Avhcre they landed. 
He told me they unhappily landed at a place where 
there were people without provisions ; whereas, had 
they had the common sense to have put off to sea 
again, and gone to another island a little further, 
they had found provisions, though without people; 
there being an island that way, as they had been 
told, where there were provisions, though no people ; 
that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had 
frequently been there, and filled the island with goat's 
and hogs at several times, where they have bred in 
such multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowls were 
an such plenty, that they could have been in no want 
of flesh though they had found no bread ; whereas 
here they were only sustained with a few roots and 
herbs« which they understood not, and which had no 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ixj 

substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave 
them spariagly enough, and who could treat them no 
better unless they would turn cannibala, and eat 
men's flesh, which was the great dainty of the 
country^ 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
strove to civilise the savages they were with, and to 
teach th^m rational customs in the ordinary way of 
living, but iu vain; and how they retorted it upon 
them as unjust, that they, who came thither for asi- 
sistance and support, should attempt to set up for 
iastructers of those that gave them bread ; intimating, 
it seems, that none should set up for the instructers 
of others but those who could live without them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities 
they were driven to ; how sometimes they were many 
days without any food at all, the island they were upon 
being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more 
indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with 
the necessaries of life than they had reason to believe 
others were in the same part of the world ; a)id yet 
they found that these savages were less ravenous 
and voracious than those who had better supplies of 
food. 

Also they added, that they could not but see with 
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the 
governing providence of God directs the events of 
thiogs ia the world; which, they said, appeared in 
their circumstances ; for if, pressed by the hardships 
they were under« and the barrenness of the country 
where tfaey were, they had searched after a better 
place to live in, they had then been out of the way of 
the relief that happened to them by my means. 



J 



t^ THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Then they gave me an account how the savages 
whom they lived among expected them to go out 
with them into their wars ; and it was true, that as 
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not have 
been serviceable only to their friends, but have made 
themselves terrible both to friends and enemies ; but 
being without powder and shot, and in a condition 
that they could not in reason deny to go out with 
their landlords to their wars ; when they came in the 
field of battle they were in a worse condition than 
the savages themselves, for they neither had bows 
nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages 
gave them, so that they could do nothing but stand 
still and be wounded with arrows, till they came up 
to the teeth of their enemy; and then indeed the 
three halberts they had were of use to them, and 
they would often drive a whole little army before 
them with those halberts and sharpened sticks put 
into the muzzles of their muskets : but that for all 
this, they were sometimes surrounded with multi- 
tudes, and in great danger from their arrows; till 
at last they found the way to make themselves large 
targets of wood, which they covered with skins of 
wild beasts whose names they knew not, and these 
covered them from the arrows of the savages ; that 
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great 
danger, and were once five of them knocked down 
together with the clubs of the savages, which was 
the time when one of them was taken prisoner, that 
is to say, the Spaniard whom I had relieved ; that 
at first they thought he had been killed, but when 
afterwards they heard he was taken prisoner, they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. n^ 

were under the greatest grief imaginabte, and would 
willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued 
hinu 

. They told me, that when they were so knocked 
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and 
stood over them fighting tilt they were come to 
themselves, all but he who they thought had been 
dead; and then they made their way with their hal- 
berts and pieces, standing close together in a line, 
through a body of above a thousand savages, beating 
down all that came in their way, got the victory over 
their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it 
was with the loss of their friend ; whom the other 
party, finding him alive, carried off with some others, 
as I gave an account in my former. 

They described, most affectionately, how they were 
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and 
companion in misery, who they thought had been 
devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz., by* 
wild men; and yet how more and more they were 
surprised with the account he gave them of his 
errand, and that there was a Christian in a place ncar^ 
much more one that was able, and had humanity 
enough to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the 
sight of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance 
of loaves of bread, things they had not seen since 
their coming to that miserable place ; how often 
they crossed it, and blessed it as bread sent from 
heaven ; and what a reviving cordial it was to their 
spirits to taste it, as also of the other things I had 
sent for their supply. And, after all, they would 
have told me sorpething of the joy thejc^ere in at 

VOL. IL I 



Ijo THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to 
the person and place from whence all these new 
comforts came ; but they told me it was impossible 
to express it by words, for their excessive joy drivingr 
them to unbecoming extravagances, they had no- 
way to describe them but by telling me that they 
bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent 
to their passion suitable to the sense that was upon 
them ; that in some it worked one way, and in some 
another ; and that some of them, through a surprise 
of joy, would burst out into tears ; others be half 
mad, and others immediately faint. This discourse 
extremely affected me, and called to my mind Fri- 
day's ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor 
people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea, after 
their ship was on fire ; the mate of the ship's joy 
when he found himself delivered in the place where 
he expected to perish ; and my own joy when, after 
twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good ship 
ready to carry me to my own country. All these 
things made me more sensible of the relation of these 
poor men, and more affected with it 

Having thus given a view of the state of things 
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what I 
did for these people, and the condition in which I 
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that 
they would be troubled no more with the savages; 
or that, if they were, they would be able to cut them 
off, if they were twice as many as before ; so that 
they had no concern about that Then I entered 
into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom 
I called governor, about their stay in the island; 
fpr as I was not come to carry any of them off, so 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

tt would not be just to carry off some, aiid leave 
others, who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if 
their strength was diminished. 

On the other hand, T told them I came to establish 
them there, not to remove them ; and then I let them 
know that I had brought with me relief of sundry 
kinds for them ; that I had been at a great charge to 
supply them with all things necessary, as well for 
their convenience as their defence ; and that I 
had such particular persons with me, as well to 
increase and recruit their number, as by the par- 
ticular necessary employments which they were bred 
to, being s^rtificers, to assist them in those things in 
which at present they were to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to 
them: and before I delivered to them the stores I 
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had 
entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that 
had been among them, and could shake hands with 
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and 
union of interest, so that there might be no more 
misunderstandings or jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and 
good humour, said, they had met with afflictions 
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends ; that for his part he would 
live and die with them ; and was so far from design- 
ing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned 
they had done nothing to him but what his own 
bad humour made necessary, and what he would 
have done, and perhaps much worse, in their case ; 
and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired 
it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done

to them ; and was very willing and desirous of living 
on terms of entire friendship and union with them ; 
and would do anything that lay in his power to con- 
vince them of it : and as for going to England, he 
cared not if he did not go thither these twenty 
years. 

The Spaniards said, they had indeed at first 
disarmed and excluded Will Atkins and his two 
countrymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let 
me know ; and they appealed to me for the neces- 
sity they were under to do so; but that Will 
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great 
fight they had with the savages, and on several oc- 
casions since, and had showed himself so faithful to^ 
and concerned for, the general interest of them all, 
that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought 
he merited as much to be trusted with arms, and 
supplied with necessaries, as any of them ; and that 
they had testified their satisfaction in him, by com- 
mitting the command to him, next to the governor 
himself; and as they had an entire confidence in him 
and all his countrynien, so they acknowledged they 
had merited that confidence by all the methods that 
honest men could merit to be valued and trusted; 
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of 
giving me this assurance, that they would never 
have any interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friend- 
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all alto- 
gether, and indeed we made a splendid feast. I 
caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on 
shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate 
we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of 
the ship's provision, with our punch-bowl, and mate- 
rials to fill it; and, in particular, I grave them ten 
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English 
beer; things that neither the Spaniards nor the 
Englishmen had tasted for many years, and which, 
it may be supposed, they were exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, 
which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were 
sent covered up close, on board our ship to the sea- 
men, that they might feast on fresh meat from on 
shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, 
that there might be no dispute about dividing, I 
showed them that there was sufficient for them all ; 
and desired that they might all take an equal quan- 
tity of the goods that were for wearing ; that is to 
say, equal when made up. At first, I distributed 
linen sufficient to make every one of them four 
shirts; and at the Spaniard's request, afterwards 
made them up six; these were exceeding comfort- 
able to them, having been what, as I may say, they 
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to 
wear them. 

I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I men- 
tioned before, to make every one a light coat like a 
frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of the sea- 
son, cool and loose; and ordered, that whenever 
they decayed, they should make more, as they 
thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, 

hats, &a 
I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction. 



134 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

sat upon the countenances of all these poor men 
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnished them. They told me I 
was a father to them ; and that, having such a cor- 
respondent as I was, in so remote a part of the 
world, it would make them forget that they were 
left in a desolate place; and they all voluntarily 
engaged to me not to leave the place without my 
consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought 
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two 
carpenters, all of them most necessary people ; but 
above all, my general artificer, than whom they could 
not name anything that was more needful to them ; 
and the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to 
work immediately, and with my leave made them 
every one a shirt the first thing he did ; and which 
was still more, he taught the women not only how to 
sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them 
assist to make the shirts for their husbands and for 
all the rest. 

As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how 
useful they were; for they took in pieces all my 
clumsy unhandy things, and made them clever con- 
venient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, 
shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind. 

But to let them see how nature made artificers at 
first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins's 
basket-house, as I called it, and they both owned 
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity 
before, nor anything so regular and so handily built, 
at least of its kind ; and one of them, when he saw it, 
^fter musing a good while, turning about to me, ^ I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

am sure/' says he, " that man has no need of us ; you 
need do nothing but give him tools." 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and 
gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, 
for we had no harrows or ploughs ; and to every sepa- 
rate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe, and a 
saw; always appointing, that as often as any were 
broken, or worn out, they should be supplied, with- 
out grudging, out of the general stores that I left be- 
hind. 

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, 
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they 
had without tale as they required ; for no man would 
care to take more than he wanted, and he must be a 
fool that would waste or spoil them on any account 
whatever. And for the use of the smith I left two 
tons of unwTought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought 
them was such, even to profusion, that they could not 
but rejoice at them ; for now they could march, as I 
used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if 
there was occasion ; and were able to Aght a thousand 
savages, if they had but some little advantages of 
situation, which also they could not miss of, if they 
had occasion* 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose 
mother was starved to death, and the maid also : she 
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman, 
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave 
her a good word. She had indeed an unhappy life 
with us, there being no woman in the ship but her- 
self; but she bore it with patience. After a while, 
seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of 



136 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

thriving upon my island, and considering that they 
had neither business nor acquaintance in the East 
Indies, or reason for taking so long a voyage ; I say, 
considering all this, both of them came to me, and 
desired I would give them leave to remain on the 
island, and be entered among my family as they 
called it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plot of 
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents 
or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, 
palisaded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his planta- 
tion. Their tents were contrived so, that they had 
each of them a room apart to lodge in^ and a middle 
tent, like a great storehouse, to lay all their goods in« 
and to eat and drink in. And now the other two 
Englishmen moved their habitation to the same place, 
and so the island, was divided into three colonies, and 
no more ; viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday, and 
the first servants, at my old habitation under the hill, 
which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they 
had so enlarged and extended their works, as well 
under as on the outside of the hill, that they Uved, 
though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never 
was. there such a little city in a wood, and ^o hid, I 
believe, in any part of the world ; for I verily believe 
a thousand men might have ranged the island a 
month, and if they had not known there was such a 
thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not 
have found it ; for the trees stood so thick and so 
close, and grew so fast matted into. one another, that 
nothing but cutting them down first, could discover 
the place, except the two narrow entrances where 
they went in and out, could be found, which was not 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. lyt 

very easy. One of them was just down at the water's 
edge, on the side of the creek ; and it was afterwards 
above two hundred yards to the place ; and the other 
was up the ladder at twice, as I have already formerly 
described it ; and they had a large wood, thick 
planted, also on the top of the hill, which contained 
above an acre, which grew apace, and covered the 
place from all discovery there, with only one narrow 
place between two trees, not easy to be discovered^ 
to enter on that side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where 
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean those 
I had left there, with their wives and children; three 
savages that were slaves ; the widow and children of 
jthe Englishman that was killed ; the young man and 
the maid ; and (by the way) we made a wife of her 
also before we went away. There were also the two 
carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me 
for them ; also the smith, who was a very necessary 
man to them, especially as the gunsmith, to take care 
of their arms ; and my other man, whom I called 
Jack of all Trades, who was himself as good almost 
as twenty men, for he was not only a very ingenious 
fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and before I went 
away, we married him to the honest maid that came 
with the youth in the ship, whom I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me natu- 
rally to say something of the French ecclesiastic, that 
I had brought with me out of the ship's crew whom I 
took at sea. It is true this man was a Roman, and 
perhaps it may give offence to some hereafter, if I 
leave anything extraordinary upon record of a man 
whom, before I begin, I must (to set him out in just 



138 THE UFE AND ADVENTOJ^ES 

colours) represent in terms very much to his dis* 
advantage in the account of Protestants; as, first, 
that he was a Papist ; secondly, a Popish priest ; and 
thirdly, a French Popish priest 

But justice demands of me to give him a due 
character; and I must say he was a grave, sober, 
pious, and most religious person; exact in his life, 
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost 
everything he did. What then can one say against 
my being very sensible of the value of such a man, 
notwithstanding his profession, though it may be my 
opinion, perhaps as well as the opinion of others who 
shall read this, that he was mistaken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him 
after he had agreed to go with me to the East Indies, 
I found reason to delight exceedingly in his conver- 
sation ; and he first began with me about religion, in 
the most obliging manner imaginable. 

"Sir," says he, "you have not only, under God '* 
(and at that he crossed his breast), " saved my Ufe, 
but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your 
ship, and by your obliging civility have taken me 
into your family, giving me an opportunity of firee 
conversation. Now, sir," says he, "you see by my 
habit what my profession is, and I guess by your 
nation what yours is. I may think it is my duty, 
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours 
on all occasions to bring all the souls that I can to 
the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the 
Catholic doctrine; but as I am here under youx 
permission, and in your family, I am bound, in 
justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and 
good manners, to be under your government; and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 139 

therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter into 
any debates on the point of religion, in which we may 
not agree* further than you shall give me leave." 

I told him, his carriage was so modest that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we were 
such people as they call heretics, but that he was not 
the first Catholic that I had conversed with without 
falling into any inconveniences, or carrying. the ques- 
tions to any height in debate; that he should not 
find himself the worse used for being of a different 
opinion from us ; and if we did not converse without 
any dislike on either side, upon that score, it would 
be his fault, not ours. 

He replied, that he thought our conversation might 
be easily separated from disputes; that it was not 
his business to cap principles with every man he 
discoursed with; and that he rather desired me to 
converse with him as a gentleman than as a religietix ; 
that if I would give him leave at any time to dis- 
course upon religious subjects, he would readily 
comply with it ; and that then he did not doubt but 
I would allow him also to defend his own opinions 
as well as he could ; but that without my leave he 
would not break in upon me with any such thing. 

He told me further, that he would not cease to do 
all that became him in his office as a priest, as well 
as a private Christian, to procure the good of the 
ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and 
though perhaps we would not join with him, and he 
could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for 
us, which he would do upon all occasions. In this 
manner we conversed; and as he was of a most 
obliging gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if I 



Uo THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, 
as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it ; of many 
adventures which had befallen him in the few years 
that he had been abroad in the world, and particu- 
larly this was very remarkable, viz., that during the 
voyage he was now engaged in, he had the misfor- 
tune to be five times shipped and unshipped, and 
never to go to the place whither any of the ships he 
was in were at first designed : that his first intent 
was to have gone to Martinico, and that he went on 
board a ship bound thither at St. Maloes ; but being 
forced into Lisbon in bad weather, the ship received 
some damage by running aground in the mouth of 
the river Tagus, and was obliged to unload her cargo 
there: that finding a Portuguese ship there, bound 
to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing 
he should easily meet with a vessel there bound to 
Martinico, he went on board in order to sail to the 
Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship 
being but an indifferent mariner, had been out in 
his reckoning, and they drove to Fyal ; where, how- 
ever, he happened to find a very good market for his 
cargo, which was corn, and therefore resolved not to 
go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the isle of 
May, to go away to Newfoundland. He had no 
remedy in the exigence but to go with the ship, 
and had a pretty good voyage as far as the Banks 
(so they call the place where they catch the fish), 
where, meeting with a French ship bound from 
France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from 
thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he thought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. J41 

fae should, have an opportunity to complete his first 
design. But when he came to Quebec, the master 
of the ship died, and the ship proceeded no further. 
So the next voyage he shipped himself for France> 
in the ship that was burnt when we took them up 
at sea, and then shipped them with us for the East 
Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had been 
disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in 
one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to 
mention further of the same person. 

But I shall not make digressions into other men's 
stories, which have no relation to my own. I return 
to what concerns our affair in the island. He came 
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the 
while we were upon the island, and it happened to 
be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's 
colony at the furthest part of the island ; I say, he 
came to me, and told me with a very grave counte- 
nance, that he had for two or three days desired an 
opportunity of some discourse with me, which he 
hoped would not be displeasing to me, because he 
thought it might, in some measure, correspond with 
my general design, which was the prosperity of my 
new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more 
than he yet thought it was, in the way of God's 
blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his 
discourse,. and turning a little short, " How, sir," said 
I, ''can it be said that we are not in the way of God's 
blessing, after such visible assistances and wonderful 
deliverances as we have seen here, and of which I 
have given you a large account ? " 

**If you had pleased, sir," said he, with a world 



142 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of modesty, and yet with great readiness, " to have 
heard me, you would have found no room to have 
been displeased, much less to think so hard of me, 
that I should suggest that you have not had won- 
derful assistances and deliverances ; and I hope, on 
your behalf, that you are in the way of God's bless- 
ing, and your design is exceeding good, and will 
prosper. But, sir," said he, "though it were more 
so than is even possible to you, yet there may be 
some among you that are not equally right in their 
actions; and you know that in the story of Israel, 
one Achan in the camp removed God's blessing 
from them, and turned His hand so against them, that 
thirty-six of them, though not concerned in the crime, 
were the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the 
weight of that punishment" 

I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and 
told him his inference was so just, and the whole 
design seemed so sincere, and was really so religious 
in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had inter- 
rupted him, and begged him to go on; and in the 
meantime because it seemed that what we had both 
to say might take up some time, I told him I was 
going to the Englishmen's plantation, and asked him 
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the 
way. He told me he would more willingly wait on 
me thither, because there, partly, the thing was acted 
which he desired to speak to me about. So we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain 
with me in what he had to say. 

'* Why then, sir," says he, " be pleased to give me 
leave to lay down a few propositions as the founda- 
tion of what I have to say, that we may not differ ia 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

the general principles, though we may be of some 
differing opinions in the practice of particulars. 
First, sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal 
articles of religion (and it is very unhappy that it is 
so, especially in the case before us, as I shall show 
afterwards), y^t there are some general principles in 
which we both agree ; viz., first, that there is a God, 
and that this God, having given us some stated 
general rules for our service and obedience, we ought 
not willingly and knowingly to offend Him, either by 
neglecting to do what He has commanded, or by 
doing what He has expressly forbidden ; and let our 
different religions be what they will, this general 
principle is readily owned by us all, that the blessing 
of God does not ordinarily follow a' presumptuous 
sinning against His command ; and every good Chris- 
tian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any 
that are under his care, living in a total neglect of 
God and His commands. It is not your men being 
Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of such, 
that discharges me from being concerned for their 
souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that 
they should live in as little distance from, and enmity 
with their Maker as possible; especially if you give 
me leave to meddle so far in your circuit." 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and 
told him I granted all he had said ; and thanked him 
that he would so far concern himself for us; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of what he 
had observed, that, like Joshua (to take his own 
parable), I might put away the accursed thing from 
us. 
" Why then, sir," says he, " I will take the liberty 



144 THR LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

you give me ; and there are three things which, if I 
am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing 
upon your endeavours here, and which I should re- 
joice, for your sake, and their own, to see removed. 
And, sir," says he, " I promise myself that you will 
fully agree with me in them all as soon as I name 
them; especially because I shall convince you that 
every one of them may with great ease, and very 
much to your satisfaction, be remedied.** 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, 
but went on : *' First, sir," says he, " you have here 
four Englishmen, who have fetched women from 
among the savages, and have taken them as their 
wives, and have had many children by them all, and 
yet are not married to them after any stated legal 
manner, as the laws of God and man require; and 
therefore are yet, in the sense of both, no less than 
adulterers, and living in adultery. To this, sir," says 
he, " I know you will object that there was no clergy- 
man or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to 
perform the ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or 
paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and 
have it signed between them. And I know also, sir, 
what the Spaniard governor has told you ; I mean of 
the agreement that he obliged them to make when 
they took these women, viz., that they should choose 
them out by consent, and keep separately to them ; 
which, by the way, is nothing of a marris^e, no 
agreement with the women as wives, but only an 
agreement among themselves, to keep them from 
quarrelling. 

" But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri-f 
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one 
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal 
obligation that there is in the contract to compel the 
man and woman at all times to own and acknowledge 
each other ; obliging the man to abstain from all 
other women, to engage in no other contract while 
these subsist; and on all occasions, as ability allows, 
to provide honestly for them and their children ; and 
to oblige the wonien to the same, or like conditions, 
mutatis mutandis^ on their side.*' 

" Now, sir," says he, *' these men may, when they 
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these 
women, disown their children, leave them to perish, 
and take other women and marry them whilst these 
are living." And here he added with some warmth, 
" How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty ? 
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in 
this place, however good in themselves, and however 
sincere in your design, while these men, who at pre- 
sent are your subjects, under your absolute govern- 
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in 
open adultery." 

I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but much 
more with the convincing arguments he supported it 
with. For it was certainly true, that though they 
had no clergyman on the spot, yet a formal contract 
on both sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed 
by any token which they had all agreed to be bound 
by, though it had been but the breaking a stick be- 
tween them, engaging the men to own these women 
for their wives upon all occasions, and never to 
abandon them or their children, and the women to 
the same with their husbands, had been an effectual 

VOL. II. K 



146 THE LIFE 4ND ADVENTURES 

lawful marris^e in the sight of God; and it w^ a 
great negiect that it was not done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with loay young 
priest by telling hi^i that all that part w;as done 
when I was not h'sre ; ,and they had lived sq many 
years with them now, that if it was adultery^ it 
was past remedv, they could do nothing in it 
now. 

"Sir/' ^ays bc» ^'asking your pardon for suph 
freedom, you are right in this; that it ]:>eing done 
in your absence, you could not be charged with that 
part of the crime. But I beseech you, flatter not 
yourself that you are not therefore under an pbliga* 
tion to do your uttermost now to put an .end to it 
^ow can you think^ but that, let the time past lie on 
whom it will, all the guilt for the future will lie 
.entirely upon you ? Because it is certainly in your 
pow(^r now to put an end to it, and in nobody's 
power but yours." 

I was so dull still that I did not take him right, 
;but I imagined that, by putting an end to it, he 
meant that I should part them, and not suffer them 
to live together any longer; and I said to hiip I 
could not do that by any means, for that it would 
put the whole island i^ confusion. He seemed sur- 
prised that I should so far m|s)take him. *' l<f o, ^ir," 
says he, " I 4o not mean that you should sep^r^te 
them, but legally and effectually marry them now. 
And, sir, as my way of marrying may not be so easy 
to reQoncile them to> though it will he as effectual 
even by your own laws ; so your way may l^ a^ well 
before God^ and as valid among men ; I n\ean hy ^ 
written contract signed by both man and )^'oman,and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

by all the witnesses present ; which all the laws of 
Europe would decree to be valid." 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so 
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar- 
tiality in his discourse as to his own party or church, 
and such a true warmth for the preserving people 
that lie had no knowledge of, or relation to ; I say, 
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of 
•God ; the like of which I had indeed not met with 
anywhere. But recollecting what he had said of 
marrying them by a written contract, which I knew 
would stand too, I returned it back upon him, and 
told him I granted all that he had said to be just, 
and on his part very kind ; that I would discourse 
with the men upon the point now when I came to 
them. And I knew no reason why they should 
scruple to let him marry them all; which I knew 
well enough would be granted to be as authentic 
and valid in England as if they were married by 
one of our own clergymen. What was afterwards 
done in this matter, I shall speak of by itself 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second 
complaint which he had to make, acknowledging I 
was very much bis debtor for the first, and thanked 
hiffi heartily for it. He told me he would use the 
same freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped 
I would take it as well ; and this was, that, notwith- 
standing these English subjects of mine, as he called 
them, had lived with these women for almost seven 
years, and had taught them to speak English, and 
even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, 
women of tolerable understanding, and capable of 
in^ruction ; yet they had not to this hour taught 



148 THE LIFE ASD ADVENTURES 

them anything of the Christian religion ; no not so 
much as to know that there was a God, or a worship, 
or in what manner God was to be served; or that 
their own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not 
who, was false and absurd. 

This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and 
what God would certainly call them to an account 
for ; and^ perhaps, at last take the work out of their 
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and 
warmly. "I am persuaded," says he, "had those 
men lived in the savage country whence their wives 
came, the savages would have taken more pains to 
have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship 
the devil, than any of these men, so far as I can see, 
has taken with them to teach them the knowledge 
of the true God. " Now, sir," said he, " though I do 
not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we 
should be all glad to see the devil's servants, and the 
subjects of his kingdom, taught to know the general 
principles of the Christian religion; that they might 
at least hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the 
resurrection, and of a future state — ^things which we 
all believe ; they had at least been so much nearer 
coming into the bosom of the true Church, than they 
are now in the public profession of idolatry and 
devil-worship." 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, 
and embraced him with an excess of passion. — " How 
far," said I to him, "have I been from understanding 
the most essential part of a Christian, viz., to love the 
interest of the Christian Church, and the good of 
other men's souls! I scarce have known what be- 
longs to being a Christian." — " Oh, sir, do not say so," 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

replied he; "this thing is not your fault." — "No," 
said I ; " but why did I never lay it to heart as well as 
you?" — "It is not too late yet," said he; "be not 
too forward to condemn yourself," — " But what can 
be done now .^"said I ; "you see I am going away." 
— •* Will you give me leave," said he, "to talk with 
these poor men about it } " — '^ Yes, with all my heart," 
said I, " and I will oblige them to give heed to what 
you say too." — "As to that," said he, "we must 
leave them to the mercy of Christ ; but it is our busi- 
ness to assist them, encourage them, and instruct 
them ; and if you will give me leave, and God His 
blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls 
shall be brought home into the great circle of Chris- 
tianity, if not into the particular faith that we all 
embrace, and that even while you stay here." Upon 
this I said, " I shall not only give you leave, but give 
you a thousand thanks for it." What followed on 
this account, I shall mention also again in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which 
we were to blame. "Why, really," says he, "it is 
of the same nature, and I will proceed (asking your 
leave) with the same plainness as before ; it is about 
your poor savages yonder, who are, as I may say, 
your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that 
is, or ought to be, received among all Christians, of 
what church, or pretended church soever, viz., that 
Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all . 
possible means, and on all possible occasions. It is 
on this principle that our Church sends missionaries 
into Persia, India, and China; and that our clergy, 
even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the 
most hazardous voyage, and the most dangerous

residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach- 
them the knowledge of the true God^ and to biuig 
them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now; str, 
you have an opportunity here to have six or seven- 
and-thirty poor savages brought over from idolatry 
to the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, 
that I wonder how you can pass by such an occasion 
of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a 
man's whole life." 

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one 
word to say ; I had here a spirit of true Christian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his particular 
principles be of what kind soever. As for me, I had 
not so much as entertained a thought of this in my 
heart before, and I believe should not have thought 
of it ;; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and 
people whom, had we any work for them to do, we. 
would have used as such, or would have been glad to 
have transported them to any other part of the 
world; for our business was to get rid of them, 
and we would all have been satisfied if they had 
been sent to any country, so they had never seen 
their own. But to the case : I say I was confounded 
at his discourse, and knew not what answec to make 
him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me ijr some 
disorder; "Sir," said he, "I shall be very sony; if 
what I have said gives you any offence." — *' No, no," 
said I, " I am offended with nobody but myself; but 
I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I 
should never take any notice of this before, but with 
reflecting what notice I am able, to take of it now* 
You know, sir»" said I," what circumstancesj I am in*;

merchanfs, atid to whom it would bd an insufferable 
piece of injustice to detain th'eit ship here, th^ men' 
lyirtg alf this while at victuals and* wages upon the

upoA' demurrage above 6ight days more, and t have 
been' here thirteien days already : so that I am per- 
fectly unable to engage in this work, unleiss 1 would

case, if this single ship should miscarry hi any pait 
of her voyage, I should be Just in the same condition 
that I was^ left in here at first, and from which I* have 
been* so wonderfully delivered. 

He owned the case Was very hard upon itie ais to 

my voyage, but laid it home upon n^y conscieilte, 

whether the blessing^ of saving seven-and-thirty souls 

Was' not Worth my venturing all I had in the world'

152 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward 
for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken 
disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I have 
dropped at last into so glorious a work." 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he 
spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his 
face glowed, and his colour came and went as if he 
had been falling into fits; in a word, he was fired 
with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I 
paused a considerable while before I could tell what 
to say to him, for I was really surprised to find a 
man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profession only, but even of any profession whatso- 
ever. But after I had considered it awhile, I asked 
him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would 
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt 
on those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted 
island for perhaps his life, and at last might not 
know whether he should be able to do them any 
good or not ? 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I 
called a venture? "Pray, sir," said he, "what do 
you think I consented to go in your ship to the East 
Indies for ? "— " Nay," said I, " that I know not, un- 
less it was to preach to the Indians." — " Doubtless 
it was," said he ; " and do you think if I can convert 
these seven-and-thirty men to the faith of Christ, it 
is not worth my time, though I should never be 
fetched off the island again ? Nay, is it not infinitely 
of more worth to save so many souls than my life is, 
or the life of twenty more of the same profession? 
Yes, sir," says he, "I would give Christ and the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155 

Blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be 
made the least happy instrument of saving the souls 
of these poor men, though I was never to set my 
foot off this island, or see my native country any 
more. But since you will honour me," says he, 
"with putting me into this work (for which I will 
pray for you all the days of my life), I have one 
humble petition to you,'* said he, "besides." — 
'' What is that ? " said I. " Why," says he, " it is, 
that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be 
my interpreter to them, and to assist me ; for with- 
out some help I cannot speak to them, or they to 
me. 

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, 
because I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reasons. He had been the companion 
of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had 
resolved to do something considerable for him if he 
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I 
knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, 
it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace 
another profession; and he would never, while his 
tyts were open, believe that his old master was a 
heretic, and would be damned ; and this might in 
the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn 
him back again to his first idolatry. 

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this 
strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say 
that I wa3 willing to part with Friday on any ac- 
count whatever ; though a work that to him was of 
more value than his life, ought to me to be of much 
more value than the keeping or parting with a ser-

Friday would by no means cbilserit to part witih me;

one word of his. To remove this difficulty, T fold him' 
Friday's father had leafilt Spanish, which I found he 
also understood, and he should serve him for an intei^

could persuade him but he would stay to endeavour 
tO' (Convert them'; but Providence gave another and^

w5meni and lie- Wittr them as they' had doiie, eall' 



OF ROBINSON CR USOE, 1 5 J 

diem their wives^ and have so many children by them^ 
and not be married lawfully to them? 

They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz., 
that there was nobody to marry them ; that they* 
agreed before the governor to keep them a$ their 
wives; and to keep them and own them ae their 
wives ; and they thought,, as things stood with them^ 
they were as legally married as if they had been' 
married by a parson, and with all the formalities' in^ 
the world* 

I told them, that no doubt they were married ihi 
the sight of God, and were bound \rt conscience to 
keep them as their wives ; but thnt the laws of men^ 
being otherwise, they might pretend they were* not' 
married, and so desert the poor women and children^ 
hereafter ; and that their wives being poor, desolate 
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way 
to help themselves ; I therefore told them, that unless 
I was assured of their honest intent, I could do no- 
thing for them ; but would take care that what I did 
should be for the women and children without them ; 
and that unless they would give some assurances that 
they would marry the women, I could not think it 
was- convenient they should continue together as man^ 
and wife ;. for that it was both, scandalous to men and' 
offensive to God,, who they could not think: would* 
bless them^ if they went on thus. 

All this passed as I expected ; and they told me,< 
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for' 
the rest, that they loved their wives as> well as if they 
had been born in their own native country; and would - 
not leave them upon any account whatever; cLnd 
they did' verily believe their wives were: a^ virtAious' 



156 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and as modest, and did to the utmost of their skill as 
much for them and for their children as any women 
could possibly do, and they would not part with them 
on any account : and Will Atkins, for his own parti- 
cular, added, if any man would take him away, and 
offer to carry him home to England, and to make 
him captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he 
would not go with him if he might not carry his wife 
and children with him, and if there was a clergyman 
in the ship he would be married to her now with all 
his heart. 

This was just as I would have it. The priest was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off. So, 
to try him further, I told him I had a clergyman with 
me, and if he was sincere I would have him married 
the next morning, and bade him consider of it, and 
talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need 
not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to do 
it, and was glad I had a minister with me; and he 
believed they would be all willing also. I then told 
him that my friend the minister was a Frenchman, 
and could not speak English, but that I would act 
the clerk between them. He never so much as asked 
me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was 
indeed what I was afraid of. But I say they never 
inquired about it. So we parted ; I went back to 
my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with 
his companions. I desired the French gentleman 
not to say anything to them till the business was 
thorough ripe, and I told him what answer the men 
had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to 
me, and told me they had been considering what I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 57 

had said ; that they were very glad to hear I had a 
clergyman in my company ; and they were very 
willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to 
be formally married as soon as I pleased ; for they 
were far from desiring to part from their wives ; and 
that they meant nothing but what was very honest 
when they chose them. So I appointed them to 
meet me the next morning, and that in the mean- 
time they should let their wives know the meaning 
of the marriage law ; and that it was not only to 
prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that 
they should not forsake them whatever might 
happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the 
meaning of the thing and were very well satisfied 
with it, as indeed they had reason to be; so they 
failed not to attend all together at my apartment 
pext morning, where I brought out my clergyman : 
and though he had not on a minister's gown, after the 
manner of England, or the habit of a priest, after 
the manner of France; yet having a black vest, 
something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he 
did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his 
language I was interpreter. 

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and 
the scruple he made of marrying the women because 
they were not baptized and professed Christians, gave 
them an exceeding reverence for his person; and 
there was no need after tliat to inquire whether he 
was a clergyman or no. 

Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been 
carried so far as that he would not have married 
them at all : nay, notwithstanding all I was able to 



1 58 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

say to jikQi^lie resisted tne, though modestly/ yet very 
-steadily; and at last refused absolutdy to marry 
theoa, unless jbe had first talked with the men and 
the women too; and though at first I was a little 
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good 
will, perceiying the sincerity of his design. 

Whea he came to them, he let them know that 
I had acquainted him with their circumstances, and 
with the present design ; that he was very willing to 
4>erform that part of his function, and marry them as 
1 had desired; but that before he could do it be 
must take the liberty to talk with them. He toW 
them that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in 
the sense of the laws of society, they had lived all 
this while in an open adultery ; and that it was true 
that nothing but the consenting to marry, or eflfectu- 
ally separating them from one another now, could 
put an end to it ; but there was a difficulty in it too, 
with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, 
which he was not fully satisfied about, viz., that of 
piarrying one that is a professed Christian to a sav- 
age, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not bap- 
tized ; and yet that he did not see that there was 
time left for it to endeavour to persuade the women 
to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom 
they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without 
which they could not be baptized 

He told them he doubted they were but indifferent 
Christians themselves ; that they had but little know- 
ledge of God or His ways, and therefore he could not 
expect that they had said much to their wives on 
that head yet ; but that unless they would promise 
him to use their endeavours with their wives to per*

sua^^ «theip;i to tt^come Christians; .a^d would, ,a3 wejj 
as they could, instruct them in the )qi,pwledg^ iind 
(belief of God that piade them, and tp ^wofship 
Jesus Chjisft that redeemed them, he ^ould apt ^arry 
them ; ipr hp would have np hand in joining Chris- 
tians ^ith savages; nor was it consistent with the 
principle^ of the Christian religion, and w^s indeed 
expressly forbidden in God*s law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I de- 
livered it y^ry faithfully to them from Jiis mouth, a$ 
^ar his own words as I oo^ld, only sometime;;B add- 
ing ^mething of ray own, to convince them how 
just it was, and how I was of his mind : and I 
always very faithfully distinguished between what I 
said from myself, and what were the clergyman's 
words. They told me, it was very true what the 
gentleman had said, that they were but very indif- 
ferent Christian^ themselves, and that they hgd 
never talked to their wives about religion. — ** Lord; 
sir," says Will Atkins, *'how should we teach them 
religiop? Why, we know nothing ourselves; ^nd 
besides, sir," said he, " should we go to talk tp them 
pf God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it 
Wovi^ be ^o make them Ifiugh at us, and ask us 
W^^ \v:^ beli^ye oursfelves? ^n^ if we shpuld tell

a surfeit P^ religion, at first hearing: fplks must have 
fpgie religion themselves before they pretend to 



l6o THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

teach other people." — ^^ Will Atkins," said I to him, 
** though I am afraid what you say has too much 
truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife that she is 
in the wrong? that there is a God, and a religion 
better than her own ; that her gods are idols ; that 
they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a 
great Being that made all things, and that can de- 
stroy all that He has made ; that He rewards the 
good, and punishes the bad ; that we are to be 
judged by Him, at last, for all we do here? You arc 
not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you 
that all this is true ; and I am satisfied you know it 
all to be true, and believe it yourself." 

'* That's true, sir," said Atkins ; *' but with what 
face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when 
she will tell me immediately it cannot be true?" 
— '*Not true !" said I ; "what do you mean by that ?" 
— " Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me it cannot be 
true, that this God (I shall tell her of) can be just, 
or can punish or reward, since I am not punished 
and sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked 
creature as she knows I have been, even to her, and 
to everybody else ; and that I should be suffered td 
live, that have been always acting so contrary to 
what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to 
have done." 

"Why truly, Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou 
speakest too much truth ; " and with that I let the 
clergyman know what Atkins had said, for he was 
impatient to know. ** Oh I" said the priest^ " tell him 
there is one thing will make him the best minister 
in the world to his wife, and that is repentance; for 
none teach repentance like true penitents. He 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. i6i 

wants nothing but to repent and then he will be so 
much the better quah'fied to instruct his wife ; he 
will then be able to tell her, that there is not only a 
God, and that He is the just rewarder of good and 
evil ; but that He is a merciful Being, and with in- 
finite goodness and long-suffering, forbears to punish 
those that offend ; waiting to be gracious, and will- 
ing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he 
should return and live ; that he often suffers wicked 
men to go on a long time, and even reserves damna- 
tion to the general day of retribution : that it is a 
clear evidence of God, and of a future state, that 
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked 
men their punishment, till they come into another 
world ; and this will lead him to teach his wife the 
doctrine of the resurrection, and of the last judg- 
ment: let him but repent for himself, he will be an 
excellent preacher of repentance to his wife." 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very 
serious all the while, and who, we could easily per- 
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it : 
when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make 
an end — "I knew all this, master," says he, "and 
a great deal more; but I ha'n't the impudence to 
talk thus to my wife, when God and my own con- 
science knows, and my wife will be an undeniable 
evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had 
never heard of God, or a future state, or anything 
about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and 
with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see 
that tears stood in his eyes), 'tis past all that with 
me."—" Past it, Atkins ! " said I ; " what dost thou 
mean by that?" — *'I know well enough what I 

VOL. II. L 



i6a THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

mean, sir," says he; "I mean it is too late; and 
that is too true." 

I told my clergyman word for word what he said. 
The poor zealous priest (I must call him so; for, be 
his opinion what it will, he had certainly a most 
singular affection for the good of other men's souls ; 
and it would be hard to think he had not the like for 
his own) — I say, this zealous, affectionate man could 
not refrain tears also : but recovering himself, be 
said to me, " Ask him but one question : Is he easy 
that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it 
were not so ? " I put the question fairly to Atkins, 
and he answered with a great deal of passion, " How 
could any man be easy in a condition that certainly 
must end in eternal destruction ? That he was far 
from being easy ; but that, on the contrary, he be- 
lieved it would one time or the other ruin him." 

" What do you mean by that ? " said I. " Why," 
he said, "he believed he should one time or an- 
other cut his own throat, to put an end to the terror 
of it" 

The clergyman shook his head, with a great con- 
cern in his face, when 1 told him all this ; but turn- 
ing quick to me upon it, said, " If that be his case, 
you may assure him it is not too late ; Christ will 
give him repentance. But pray," says he, " explain 
this to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ, 
and the merit of His passion procuring divine mercy 
for him, how can it be too late for any man to re- 
ceive mercy } Does he think he is able to sin be- 
yond the power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray tell 
him, there may be a time when provoked mercy will 
no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

ut that 'tis never too late for men to ask mercy; 
ad we that are Christ's servants are commanded 
) preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus 
hristy to all those that sincerely repent; so that 
s never too late to repent.*' 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
irnestness; but it seemed as if he turned off the 
scourse to the rest; for he said to me he would 
> and have some talk with his wife: so he went 
it awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived 
ley were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of re- 
gion ; much as I was when I went rambling away 
om my father; and yet that there were none of 
lem backward to hear what had been said ; and 
1 of them seriously promised that they would talk 
ith their wives about it, and do their endeavour to 
srsuade them to turn Christians. 
The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported 
hat answer they gave, but said nothing a good 
hile; but at last shaking his head, **We that are 
hrist's servants," says he, '* can go no further than 
) exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, sub- 
lit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all 
e can do; we are bound to accept their good 
ords ; but believe me, sir," said he, " whatever you 
lay have known of the life of that man you call 
^ill Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere con- 
?rt among them; I take that man to be a true 
enitent I won t despair of the rest ; but that man 
1 perfectly struck with the sense of his past life; 
nd I doubt not but when he comes to talk of re- 
gion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually to 
; for attempting to teach others is sometimes the 



i64 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

best way of teaching ourselves. I knew a man" 
added he, "who, having nothing but a summary 
notion of religion himself, and being wicked and pro- 
fligate to the last degree in his life, made a thorough 
reformation in himself, by labouring to convert a 
Jew : and if that poor Atkins begins but once to talk 
seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, my life for it he 
talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself 
a penitent ; and who knows what may follow?" 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising 
as above to endeavour to persuade their wives to 
embrace Christianity, he married the other three 
couple ; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet 
come in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, 
was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and 
turning to me, says he, ** I entreat you, sir, let us 
walk out of your labyrinth here and look ; I dare 
say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other 
talking seriously with his wife, and teaching her 
already something of religion." I began to be of 
the same mind; so we went out together, and I 
carried him a way which none knew but myself, and 
where the trees were so thick set, as that it was not 
easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and far 
harder to see in than to see out; when, coming to 
the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins, and his tawny 
savage wife, sitting under the shade of a bush, very 
eager in discourse. I stopped short till my clergyman 
came up to me, and then having showed him where 
they were, we stood and looked very steadily at 
them a good while. 

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing 
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 165 

down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to 
elf, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
IV,*' says my clergyman, " you see ray words are 
* good; the man preaches to her; mark him; 
he is telling her that our God has made him, 
her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the 
Is, the trees, &c." — " I believe he is,'* said I. 
ediately we perceived Will Atkins start up 
his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up 
his hands ; we supposed he said something, but 
ould not hear him : it was too far off for that : 
id not continue kneeling half a minute, but 
s and sits down again by his wife, and talks to 
gain. We perceived then the woman very atten- 
but whether she said anything or no we could 
ell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees, 
id see the tears run plentifully down my clergy- 
5 cheeks; and I could hardly forbear myself; 
t was a great affliction to us both, that we were 
lear enough to hear anything that passed be- 
1 them. 

;11, however, we could come no nearer, for fear 

sturbing them; so we resolved to see an end 

is piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud 

jh to us without the help of voice. He sat 

again, as I have said, close by her, and talked 

earnestly to her, and two or three times we 

see him embrace her passionately; another 

ive saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe 

yes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of 

port very unusual; and after several of these 

s, we saw him on a sudden jump up again and 

her his hand to help her up, when immediately 



i66 - THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

leading her by the hand a step or two, they both 
kneeled down together, and continued so about two 
minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out 
aloud, " St. Paul, St. Paul, behold he prayeth ! " I 
was afraid Atkins would hear him; therefore I en- 
treated him to withhold himself a while, that we 
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must 
confess, was the most affecting, and yet the most 
agreeable, that ever I saw in my life. Well, he 
strove with himself, and contained himself for a 
while, but was in such raptures of joy to think that 
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, 
that he was not able to contain himself. He wept 
several times ; then throwing up his hands and cross- 
ing his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, 
and by way of giving God thanks for so miraculous 
a testimony of the success of our endeavours : some 
he spoke softly, and I could not well hear; others 
audibly ; some in Latin, some in French ; then two 
dr three times the tears of joy would interrupt him, 
that he could not speak at all. But I begged that 
he would compose himself, and let us more narrowly 
and fully observe what was before us, which he did 
for a time, and the scene was not ended there yet ; 
for after the poor man and his wife were risen again 
from their knees, we observed he stood talking still 
eagerly to her ; and we observed by her motion that 
she was greatly affected with what he said, by her 
frequent lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her 
breast, and such other postures as usually express 
the greatest seriousness and attention. This con- 
tinued about half a quarter of an hour, and then they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

walked away too ; so that we could see no more of 
them in that situation. 

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; 

and first I told him» t was glad to see the particulars 

we had both been witnesses to ; that though I was 

hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began 

to think it was all very sincere here, both in the 

man and his wife, however ignorant they both might 

be; and I hoped such a beginning would have yet 

a more happy end : "And who knows," said I, "but 

these two may in time> by instruction and example, 

work upon some of the others ?" — ** Some of them ! " 

said he, turning quick upon me, "ay, upon all of 

them : depend upon it, if those two savages (for he 

has been but little better as you relate it) should 

embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave till 

they work upon all the rest; for true religion is 

naturally communicative, and he that is once made 

a Christian will never leave a pagan behind him, if 

he can help it." I owned it was a most Christian 

principle to think so, and a testimony of a true zeal, 

as well as a generous heart in him. "But, my 

friend," said I, "will you give me liberty to start 

one difficulty here ? I cannot tell how to object the 

least thing against that affectionate concern which 

you show for the turning the poor people from their 

paganism to the Christian religion; but how does 

this comfort you, while these people are, in your 

account, out of the pale of the Catholic Church, 

without which, you believe, there is no salvation ; 

so that you esteem these but heretics still; and, 

for other reasons, as eflfectually lost as the pagans 

themselves ? '' 



i68 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

To this he answered, with abundance of candour 
and Christian charity, thus : '' Sir, I am a Catholic 
of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of St. 
Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the 
Roman faith. But yet, if you will believe me, and 
this I do not speak in compliment to you, or in re- 
spect to my circumstances and your civilities ; I say, 
nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call your- 
selves reformed, without some charity: I dare not 
say, though I know it is our opinion in general, yet I 
dare not say, that you cannot be saved ; I will by no 
means limit the mercy of Christ, so far as to think 
that He cannot receive you into the bosom of His 
Church, in a manner to us imperceivable, and which 
it is impossible for us to know ; and I hope you have 
the same charity for us. I pray daily for your being 
all restored to Christ's Church, by whatsoever methods 
He, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct In the mean- 
time, sure you will allow it to consist with me, as a 
Roman, to distinguish far between a Protestant and 
a pagan; between him that calls on Jesus Christ, 
though in a way which I do not think is according to 
the true faith ; and a savage, a barbarian, that knows 
no God, no Christ, no Redeemer at all ; and if you 
are not within the pale of the Catholic Church, we 
hope you are nearer being restored to it than those 
that know nothing at all of God or His Church. I 
rejoice, therefore, when I see this poor man, who, 
you say, has been a profligate, and almost a mur- 
derer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as wc 
suppose he did, though not fully enlightened ; believ- 
ing that God, from whom every such work proceeds, 
will sensibly touch his heart, and bring him to th^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

further knowledge of the truth in His own time ; and 
if God shall influence this poor man to convert and 
instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, I can never 
believe that he shall be cast away himself; and have I 
not reason then to rejoice, the nearer any are brought 
to the knowledge of Christ, though they may not be 
brought quite home into the bosom of the Catholic 
Church, just at the time when I may desire it; leaving 
it to the goodness of Christ to perfect His work in His 
own time, and His own way ? Certainly I would 
rejoice if all the savages in America were brought 
like this poor woman to pray to God, though they 
were to be all Protestants at first, rather than they 
should continue pagans and heathens ; firmly believ- 
ing, that He, who had bestowed that first light upon 
them, would further illuminate them with a beam of 
His heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of 
His Church, when He should see good."

CHAPTER VII. 

SINCERR AND WORTHY CHARACTER OP THE PRiRSt-^ 
DIALOGUE WITH WILL ATKINS AND MYSELF— CdM- 
VERSATION BETWIXT ATKINS AND HIS INDIAN WIFR 
ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION — HER BAPTISM- 
SETTLEMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH. 

I WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this 
truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by 
the power of his reasoning ; and it presently occurred 
to my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, 
we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever Church 
or particular profession we joined to, or joined in ; 
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into 
right principles ; and, in a word, as he thought that 
the like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told 
him, I believed, had all the members of his Church 
the like moderation, they would soon be all Protest- 
ants ; and there we left that part, for we never dis- 
puted at all. 

However, I talked to him another way; and, taking 
him by the hand, " My friend," said I, " I wish all the 
clergy of the Roman Church were blessed with such 
moderation, and an equal share of your charity. I am 
entirely of your opinion ; but I must tell you, that 
if you should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, 
they would put you into the Inquisition." 



OF ROBINSON CR USOE. 1 7 1 

" It may be so," said he ; " I know not what they 
might do in Spain and Italy ; but I will not say they 
would be the better Christians for that severity ; for 
I am sure there is no heresy in too much charity." 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our 
business there was over ; so we went back our own 
way ; and when we came back we found them wait* 
ing to be called in. Observing this, I asked my 
clergyman, if we should discover to him that we had 
seen him under the bush, or no ; and it was his 
opinion we should not ; but that we should talk to 
him first, and hear what he would say to us ; so we 
called him in alone, nobody being in the place but 
ourselves ; and I began with him thus : 

"Will Atkins," said I, '*pr'ythee what education 
had you } What was your father? " 

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be, sir; my 
father was a clergyman. 

R. C. What education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would have taught me well, sir; but I 
despised all education, instruction, or correction, like 
a beast as I was. 

R, C. It is true, Solomon says, '* He that despiseth 
reproof is brutish." 

W. A. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered 
my father : for God's sake, sir, talk no more about 
that, sir ; I murdered my poor father. 

Priest Ha! a murderer? 

[Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as he spoke 
it), and looked pale : it seems he believed that WiU bad really 
killed his own father.] 

R. C. No, 'no, sir, I do not understand him so. 



172 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Will Atkins, explain yourself; you did not kill your 
father, did you, with your own hands ? 

W. A. No, sir; I did not cut his throat; but I 
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened 
his days ; I broke his heart by the most ungrateful, 
unnatural return, for the most tender, affectionate 
treatment that ever father gai^e, or child could 
receive. 

R, C, Well, I did not ask you about your father 
to extort this confession; I pray God give you re- 
pentance for it, and forgive you that and all your 
other sins: but I asked you, because I see that, 
though you have not much learning, yet you are 
not so ignorant as some are in things that are good ; 
that you have known more of religion a great deal 
tiian you have practised. 

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the con- 
fession that I make about my father, conscience 
does; and whenever we come to look back upon 
our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are 
certainly the first that touch us; the wounds they 
make He deepest ; and the weight they leave will 
lie heaviest upon the mind of all the sins we can 
commit 

R. C, You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, 
Atkins; I cannot bear it 

W. A. You bear it, master ! I dare say you know 
nothing of it 

R, C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, 
I may say every tree in this island, is witness to the 
anguish of my soul for my ingratitude, and base 
usage of a good tender father; a father much like 
yours by your description; and I murdered my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

father as well as you, Will Atkins; but think, for 
all that my repentance is short of yours too, by a 
jjreat deal. 

[I would have said more, if I could have restrained my passions ; 
but I thought this poor man*s repentance was so much sincerer 
than mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse and retire ; 
for I was surprised with what he said, and thought that, instead 
of my going about to teach and instruct him, the man was made 
a teacher and instructer to me, in a most surprising and un< 
expected manner.] 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was 
greatly affected with it, and said to me, " Did I not 
say, sir, that when this man was converted, he would 
preach to us all ? I tell you, sir, if this one man be 
made a true penitent, here will be no need of me, 
he will make Christians of all in the island/' But 
having a little composed myself, I renewed my 
discourse with Will Atkins. 

" But, Will," said I, ** how comes the sense of this 
matter to touch you just now ?" 

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has 
struck a dart through my very soul; I have been 
talking about God and religion to my wife, in order, 
as you directed me, to make a Christian of her: and 
she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall 
never forget while I live. 

R. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached 
to you; but when you were moving religious argu- 
ments to her, conscience has flung them back upon 
you. 

W. A. Ay, sir, with such a force as is not to be 
resisted. 
R. C, Pray, Will, let us know what passed be- 



174 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

tween you and your wife ; for I know something o 
it already. 

W. A. Sir, it IS impossible to give you a ful 
account of it : I am too full to hold it, and yet hav 
no tongue to express it ; but let her have said wha 
she will, and though I cannot give you an accoun 
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amen 
and reform my life. 

i?. C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin 
Will } for this has been an extraordinary case, tha 
is certain ; she has preached a sermon indeed, if she 
has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws 
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men 
and women were obliged to enter into such compacts, 
as it was neither in the power of one or other to 
break ; that otherwise, order and justice could not be 
maintained, and men would run from their wives, 
and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one 
another, and neither families be kept entire, nor in- 
heritances be settled by a legal descent. 

R. C, You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you 
make her understand what you meant by inheritance 
and families ? They know no such thing among the 
savages, but marry anyhow, without any regard to 
relation, consanguinity, or family ; brother and sister, 
nay, as I have been told, even the father and daugh- 
ter, and the son and the mother. 

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed ; my 
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor 
it. Perhaps for any further relations they may not 
be so exact as we are ; but she tells me they never 
touch one another, in the near relations you speak of. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17S 

R. C Well, what did she s«q^ to whut you told 
her? 

W. A* She said she liked it very well ; and it was 
much better than in her country, 

R, C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I 
asked her, if she would be married to me our way ? 
She asked me, what way that was ? I told her 
marriage was appointed of God; and here we had a 
strange talk together indeed, as ever man and wife 
had, I believe. 

[AC B* This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife, as I toolc 
it down ip writing just lifter he told it me, was as follows :] 

Wife. Appointed by your God ! Why, have you a 
God in your country ? 

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 

Wife. No your God in my country; my country 
have the great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who 
God is ; God is in heaven, and made the heaven and 
the earth, the sea, and all that in them ia 

Wife. No makee de earth ; no you God makee de 
earth; no makee my country. 

[W. A. laogbed a little at her expression of God not making her 
country.] 

Wife. No laugh : why laugh me } This no ting to 
laugh. 

(He was justly reproTed by his wife, for she was more serious than 
he at first.] 

W. A. That's true, indeed ; I will not laugh any 
more, my dear. 



176 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Wife. Why you say, you God make all ? 

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, 
and you, and me, and all things ; for he is the only 
true God ; there is no God but he ; he lives for ever 
in heaven. 

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true, indeed ; but I have been a 
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac- 
quaint thee with anything before, but have lived 
without God in the world myself. 

Wife. What have you de great God in your 
country, you no know him ? No say O to him ? No 
do good ting for him ? That no possible ! 

W. A. It is too true, though, for all that : we live 
as if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no 
power on earth. 

Wife, But why God let you do so ? Why he no 
makee you good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault. 

Wife. But you say me he is great, much great, 
have much great power ; can make kill when he will : 
why he no makee kill when you no serve him ? no 
say O to him ? no be good mans ? 

W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead, and 
I ought to expect it ; for I have been a wicked wretch, 
that is true : but God is merciful, and does not deal 
with us as we deserve. 

Wife. But then do not you tell God tankee for 
that too. 

W. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God for his 
mercy, any more than I have feared God for his 
power. 

Wife. Then you God no God ; me no tink, believe 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

. • ■ • 

he be such one, great much power, strong; no makee 
kill you, though you makee him much angry I 

W, A. What J will my wicked life hinder you from 
believing in God ! What a dreadful creature am I ! 
And what a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of 
Christians hinder the conversion of heathens ! 

Wife. How me tink you have great much God up 
there {she points up to heaven), and yet no do well, no 
do good ting ? Can he tell ? Sure he no tell what 
you do. 

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he 
fiears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we 
think, though we do not speak. 

Wife, What ! he no hear you swear, curse, speak 
the great damn ? 

W, A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

Wife. Where be then the muchee great power 
strong } 

W.A. He is merciful; that is all we can say for 
it; and this proves him to be the true God: he is 
God, and not man; and therefore we are not con- 
sumed. 

[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think how 
he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears, and 
knows the secret thoughts of the heart and all that we do, and 
yet that he had dared to do all the vile things he had done.] 

Wife. Merciful 1 what you call dat ? 

W. A. He is our father and maker; and he pities 
^nd spares us. 

Wife, So then he never makee kill, never angry 
^hen you do wicked ; then he no good himself, or no 
great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear ; he is infinitely good 

VOL. IT. M 



178 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and infinitely great, and able to punish too ; and 
sometimes, to show his justice and vengeance, he lets 
fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make examples ; 
many are cut oflT in their sins. 

Wife. But no makee kill you yet ; then he tell you, 
may be, that he no makee you kill, so you make de 
bargain with him, you do bad ting, he no be angry at 
you, when he be angry at other mans ? 

W. A, No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions 
upon his goodness ; and he would be infinitely just if 
he destroyed me, as he has done other men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead I 
What you say to him for that? You no tell him 
tankee for all that too ! 

W, A, I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is 
true. 

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better? 
You say he makee you. 

W. A. He made me, as he made all the world ; 'tis 
I have deformed myself, and abused his goodness, 
and have made myself an abominable wretch. 

Wife, I wish you makee God know me; I no 
makee him angry ; I no do bad wjcked ting. 

[Here WiU Atkini said his heart sank within him, to hear a poor 
untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such 
a wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her aboot 
God, but what the reproach of bis own carriage would nake 
most irrational to her to believe ; nay, that already she cookl 
not believe in God, because he that was so wicked was not de- 
stroyed.] 

W. A. My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach 
you to know God, not God to know you, for he knows 
you already, and every thought in your heart. 



OF ROBINSO]^ CRUSOE. 179 

Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now ; 
he know me wish to know him ; how shall me know 
who makee me ? 

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot 
teach thee ; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know 
him ; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to teach 
thee. 

[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to 
make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that he said 
he fell down on his knees before her, and prayed to God to en- 
lighten her mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and 
to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the unworthy instru- 
ment of instructing her in the principles of religion ; alter which 
he sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on.] 

N. B, This was the time when we saw him kneel down and lift 
up his hands. 

Wife. What you put down the knee for? What 
you hold up the hand for ? What you say ? Who 
you speak to ? What is that ? 

W, A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my 
submission to him that made me : I said O to him; 
as you call it, and as you say your old men do to 
their idol Benamuckee ; that is, I prayed to him. 

Wife. What you say O to him for > 

W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and 
your understanding, that you may know him, and be 
accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too } 

W. A. Yes, he can ; he can do all things. 

Wife. But he no hear what you say ? 

W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him : and pro- 
mised to hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray ! When he bid you ? How 
he bid you } What you hear him speak } 



i8o THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

IV. A. No, we do not hear him speak ; but he has 
revealed himself many ways to us. 

[Here he was at a great lots to make her understand that God had 
revealed himself to us by his word ; and what his word was ; 
but at last he told it her thus}— 

W. A, God has spoken to some good men in 
former days, even from heaven, by plain words ; and 
God has inspired good men by his Spirit : and they 
have written all his laws down in a book. 

Wi/e, Me no understand that : where is book ? 

IV. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this 
book ; but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it 
for you to read it. 

[Here he embraced her with great affection ; but with inexpres- 
sible grief, that he had not a Bible.] 

Wife. But how you makee me know that God 
teachee them to write that book ? 

W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be 
God. 

IVi/e. What rule ? what way you know ? 

W. A, Because he teaches and commands nothing 
but what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to 
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy : 
and because he forbids and commands us to avoid 
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its- 
consequences. 

Wi/e. That me would understand, that me faiik. 
see ; if he reward all good thing, punish all wickeci^ 
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked 
thing, he makee all thing, he give all thing; he 
hear me when I say O to him, as you go to do jus^ 
now ; he makee me good if I wish be good ; he spare 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. i8r 

me, no makee kill me when I no be good ; all this 
you say he do : yes, he be great God ; me take, think, 
believe him be great God; me say O to him too 
with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man said he could forbear no 
longer ; but, raising her up, made her kneel by him ; 
and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the 
knowledge of Himself by His Spirit : and that, by 
some good providence, if possible, she might some 
time or other come to have a Bible, that she might 
read the Word of God, and be taught by Him to 
^now Him. 

[This was the time that we saw him lift her np by the hand, and 
saw him kneel down by her, as above.] 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after 

^*^ts, too long to set down here ; and particularly she 

'^^^de him promise that, since he confessed his own 

* *"« had been a wicked, abominable course of provoca- 

*^n against God, he would reform it, and not make 

^-^^od angry any more, lest He should make him dead, 

she called it, and then she should be left alone, 

^d never be taught to know this God better ; and 

"^^st he should be miserable, as he had told her 

"^^icked men should be after death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting to 
X:js both, but particularly to the young clergyman ; he 
Xjvas indeed wonderfully surprised with it ; but under 
^he greatest affliction imaginable that he could not 
^alk to her ; that he could not speak English to make 
lier understand him; and as she spoke but very 
broken English, he could not understand her. How- 
ever, he turned himself to me, and told me that he 



i82 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

believed there must be vaoxt to do with this womaa 
than to marry her. I did not understand him at first, 
but at length he explained himself, viz^ that she 
ought to be baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for 
going about it presently: "No, no; hold, sir," said 
he ; " though I would have her baptized by all meanst 
yet I must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, 
has indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to 
be willing to embrace a religious life ; and has given 
her just ideas of the being of a God, of His power, 
justice, and mercy; yet I desire to know of him if 
he has said anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of 
the salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith in 
Him, and the redemption by Him ; of the Holy Spirit, 
the resurrection, the last judgment, and a future 
state." 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but 
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told 
us he had said something to her of all those things, 
but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his 
own conscience so reproached him with his horrid, 
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions, 
that her knowledge of him should lessen the atten- 
tion she should giye to those things, and make her 
rather contemn religion than receive it : but he was 
assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to 
receive due impressions of all those things, that if I 
would but discourse with her, she would make it 
appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not 
be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself 
as interpreter between my religious priest and the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 185 

woman, I entreated him to begin with her. But sure 

such a sermon was never preached by a popish priest 

in these latter ages of the world ; and, as I told him* 

r thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all 

the sincerity of a Christian, without the errors of a 

Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be such a 

clergyman as the Roman bishops were before the 

Church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over 

^he consciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace 
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by Him, 
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did 
the first notions of a God, but with joy and faith, 
with an affection and a surprising degree of under- 
standing, scarce to be imagined, much less to be ex- 
pressed ; and at her own request she was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated 
him that he would perform that office with some 
caution, that the man might not perceive he was of 
the Roman Church, if possible ; because of other ill 
consequences which might attend a difference among 
us in that very religion which we were instructing 
the other in. He told me, that as he had no con- 
secrated chapel, nor proper things for the office, I 
should see he would do it in a manner that I should 
not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic him- 
self, if I had not known it before ; and so he did ; for 
saying only some words over to himself in Latin, 
which I could not understand, he poured a whole 
dishful of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing 
in French, very loud. Maty (which was the name her 
husband desired me to give her, for I was her god- 
father), / baptize thee in the name of the Father^ and 



A

jof the Sottj and of the Holy Ghost; so that none 
could know anything by it what religion he was of: 
he gave the benediction afterwards in Latin; but 
either Will Atkins did not know but it was in French, 
or else did not take notice of it at that time. 

As soon as this was over, he married them ; and 
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to 
Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner ex- 
horted him not only to persevere in that good disr 
position he was in, but to support the convictions 
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; 
told him it was in vain to say he repented, if he did 
not forsake his crimes ; represented to him, how God 
had honoured him with being the instrument of 
bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian 
religion ; and that he should be careful he did not 
dishonour the grace of God ; and that if he did, he 
would see the heathen a better Christian than him- 
self: the savage converted, and the instrument cast 
away! 

He said a great many good things to them both, 
and then recommended them, in a few words, to 
God's goodness ; gave them the benediction again, I 
repeating everything to them in English: and thus 
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most plea- 
sant agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts 
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty- 
seven savages, and fain he would have stayed upon 
the island to have undertaken it: but I convinced 
him, first, that his undertaking was impracticable in 
itself ; and secondly, that, perhaps, I could put it into

SL ytzy of being done in his absence, to his satisfaction ; 
of which by and by. 

Having thus brought the aflfair of the island to a 
r-B. arrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the 
sYiip, when the young man, whom I had taken out of 
^Ine famished ship's company, came to me, and told 
he understood I had a clergyman with me, and 
liat I had caused the Englishmen to be married to 
:Yit savages whom they called wives ; that he had a 
atch too, which he desired might be finished before 
t went, between two Christians, which he hoped would 
not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his 
nother's servant, for there was no other Christian 
woman on the island. So I began to persuade him 
not to do anything of that kind rashly, or because he 
found himself in this solitary circumstance. I repre- 
sented that he had some considerable substance in the 
World, and good friends, as I understood by himself, and 
by his maid also ; that the maid was not only poor, and 
A servant, but was unequal to him, she being twenty- 
six or twenty-seven years old, and he not above seven- 
teen or eighteen ; that he might very probably, with 
my assistance, make a remove from this wilderness, 
«uid come into his own country again, and that then it 
would be a thousand to one but he would repent his 
<^oice, and the dislike of that circumstance might be 
disadvantageous to both. I was going to say more, 
but he interrupted me, smiling; and told me, with a 
great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses ; 
that he had nothing of that kind, in his thoughts, his 
present circumstances being melancholy and discon- 
^Ute enough, and he was very glad to hear that I 



1 86 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

had some thoughts of putting them In a way to se^ 
their own country again; and that nothing should 
hav6 set him upon staying there, but that the vojrage 
I was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, 
and would carry him quite out of the reach of all his 
friends ; that he had nothing to desire of me^ but that 
I would settle him in some little property of the 
island where he was ; give him a servant or two^ and 
some few necessaries, and he would settle him* 
self here like a planter, waiting the good time when, 
if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him, 
and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I 
came to England; that he would give me some 
letters to his friends in London, to let them know 
how good I had been to him, and what part of the 
world, and what circumstances I had left him in; 
and he promised me, that whenever I redeemed him. 
the plantation, and all the improvements he had 
made upon it, let the value be what it would, should 
be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, con- 
sidering his youth, and was the more agreeable to 
me, because he told me positively the match was 
not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances, 
that if I lived to CQme safe to England, I would 
deliver his letters, and do his business eflfectually, 
and that he might depend I would never forget the 
circumstances I left him in. But still I was im- 
patient to know who was the person to be married ; 
upon which he told me it was my Jack-of-all-trades 
and his maid Susan. 

I was most agreeably surprised when he named 
the match ; for indeed I had thought it very suitable. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. htj 

The character of that man I have given already ; and 
as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober; 
and religious yoiing woman ; liad a veiy good share 
of sense ; was agreeable enough in her person ; spok6 
ycry handsomely, and to the purpose ; always with 
decency and good manners, and not backward to 
speak when anything required it, or impertinently 
forward to speak when it was not her business ; very 
handy and house-wifely in anything that was before 
hef; an excellent manager, and fit indeed to have 
been governess to the whole island ; she knew 
very well how to behave herself to all kind of folks 
she had about her, and to better, if she had found 
any there. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we 
married them the same day; and as I was father 
at the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I 
gave her a' portion ; for I appointed h^r and her 
husband a handsome large space of ground for their 
plantation : and indeed this match, and the proposal 
the young gentleman made to me, to give him a 
small property in the island, put me upon parcelling 
it out among them, that they might not quarrel 
afterwards about their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober, 
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceed- 
ing pious and religious, and, as far as I may be 
allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily 
believe was a true sincere penitent. 

He divided things so justly, and so much to 
every one's satisfaction, that they only desired one 
general writing imder ipy hand for the \irhole, which 



t88 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to 
them, setting out the bounds and situation of ever>' 
man's plantation, and testifying that I gave them 
thereby, severally, a right to the whole possession and 
inheritance of the respective plantations or farms, 
with their improvements, to them and their heirs; 
reserving all the rest of the island as my own pro- 
perty, and a certain rent for every particular planta* 
tion after eleven years, if I or any one from me, or in 
my name, came to demand it, producing an attested 
copy of the same writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I 
told them, I was not capable of giving them better 
rules than they were able to give themselves ; only 
made them promise me to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another: and so I prepared 
to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being 
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them- 
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but 
odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a noolc 
of the island, independent, and indeed unemployed ; 
for, excepting the providing themselves food, which 
they had difficulty enough in doing sometimes, they 
had no manner of business or property to manage : 
I proposed therefore to the governor Spaniard, that 
he should go to them with Friday's father, and 
propose to them to remove, and either plant for 
themselves, or take them into their several families 
as servants to be maintained for their labour, but 
without being absolute sliaves ; for I would not admit 
them to make them slaves by force by any means, 
because they had their liberty given by capitulation^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 1 89 

and as it were articles of surrender, which they ought 
not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and 
came all very cheerfully along with him; so we 
allotted them land and plantations, which three or 
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em- 
ployed as servants in the several families we had 
settled ; and thus my colony was in a manner settled 
as follows: the Spaniards possessed my original 
habitation, which was the capital city, and extended 
their plantation all along the side of the brook^ which 
made the creek that I have so often described, as far 
as my bower ; and as they increased their culture, it 
went always eastward. The English lived in the 
north-east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades 
began, and came on southward and south-west, to- 
wards the back part of the Spaniards ; and every 
plantation had a great addition of land to take in, 
if they found occasion, so that they need not jostle 
one another for want of room. 

All the west end of the island was left uninhabited, 
thaty if any of the savages should come on shore 
there, only for their usual customary barbarities, they 
might come and go ; if they disturbed nobody, no- 
body would disturb them ; and no doubt but they 
vrere often ashore, and went away again, for I never 
lieard that the planters were ever attacked and dis- 
turbed any more.

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to 
my friend the clergyman that the work of convert- 
ing the savages might perhaps be set on foot in his 
absence to his satisfaction ; and I told him that now 
I thought it was put in a fair way ; for the savages 
being thus divided among the Christians, if they 
would but every one of them do their part with those 
which came under their hands, I hoped it might have 
a very good effect. 

He agreed presently in that. " If," said he, " they 
will do their part ; but how," says he, •'shall we ob- 
tain that of them ? " I told him we would call them 
all together, and leave it in charge with them, or g6 
to them one by one, which he thought best ; so we 
divided it — he to speak to the Spaniards, who were 
all Papists, and I to the English who were all Pro- 
testants; and we recommended it earnestly to them, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 191 

and made them promise that they would never make 
any distinction of Papist or Protestant in their ex- 
horting the savages to turn Christians, but teach them 
the general knowledge of the true God, and of their 
Saviour Jesus Christ ; and they likewise promised us 
that they vfould never have any differences or dis- 
putes one with another about religion. 

When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call 
it so, for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, 
I believe was not standing in the world again !) — I 
say, when I came thither, I found the young woman 
I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were 
become intimates; and this prudent and religious 
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins 
had begun, and though it was not above four days 
after what I have related, yet the new- baptized 
savage woman was made such a Christian as I have 
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observation 
or conversation in the world. 

It came next into my mind in the morning, before 
I went to them, that among all the needful things I 
had to leave with them, I had not left a Bible, in 
which I showed myself less considering for them 
than my good friend the widow was for me, when 
she sent me the cargo of jf 100 from Lisbon, where 
she packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-book. 
However, the good woman's charity had a greater 
extent than ever she imagined, for they were reserved, 
fpr the comfort and instruction of those that made 
much better use of them than I had done. 
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket ; and when 



I9i THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

I came to Will Atkins's tent, or house, I found t J^^ 
young woman and Atkins's baptized wife had be^^^ 
discoursing of religion together (for Will Atki ^^ 
told it me with a great deal of joy). I asked if th^sy 
were together now? And he said yes; so I we:^*it 
into the house, and he with me, and we found the ^^^ 
together very earnest in discourse : " Oh, sir," sa^i-^s 
Will Atkins, " when God has sinners to reconcile ^^o 
Himself, and aliens to bring home, He never wan^ ^ 

a messenger: my wife has got a new instructor 1 

knew I was unworthy, as I was incapable of th. — =at 
work — that young woman has been sent hither fro: 
heaven — she is enough to convert a whole island 
savages." The young woman blushed, and rose 
to go away, but I desired her to sit still; I told hi 
she had a good work upon her hands, and I ho] 
God would bless her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive th< 
had any book among them, though I did not as! 
but I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out n» Jf 
Bible. " Here," said I to Atkins, " I have brought t 
you an assistant, that perhaps you had not before--^ 
The man was so confounded, that he was not abl^ 
to speak for some time ! but recovering himself, h^ 
takes it with both hands, and turning to his wifr, 
"Here, my dear," says he, "did not I tell you our 
God, though He lives above, could hear what we 
said ? Here is the book I prayed for, when you and 
I kneeled down under the bush ; now God has heard 
us, and sent it" When he had said thus, the man fell 
in such transports of a passionate joy, that between 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1931 

the joy of having it, and giving God tlianks for it,* 
the tears ran down his face like a child that was 
crying. 

The woman was surprised, and was like to have 
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of; 
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon 
her husband's petition : it is true that providentially 
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent 
sense ; but I believe it would have been no difficult 
niatter at that time to have persuaded the poor 
Woman to have believed that an express messenger 
came from heaven on purpose to bring that indi- 
vidual book ; but it was too serious a matter to suffer 
^ny delusion to take place : so I turned to the young 
W'oman, and told her we did not desire to impose 
Upon the new convert in her first and more ignorant 
Understanding of things, and begged her to explain 
to her that God may be very properly said to answer 
Our petitions, when in the course of His providence 
Such things are in a particular manner brought to- 
pass as we petitioned for; but we do not expect 
returns from heaven in a miraculous and particular 
manner ; and that it is our mercy it is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually ^ 

so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used 

here ; and I should have thought it one of the most 

unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so ; 

"but the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really 

not to be expressed ; and there we may be sure was 

xio delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful 

in the world for anything of its kind than he was for.

this Bible ; atid I believe never any man wis glad of 
a Bibie from a better principle ; and though he had 
been a most profligate creature, desperate, head- 
strong) outrageous, furious, and wicked to a great 
degree, yet this man is a standing rule to us all for 
the well instructing children, viz., that parents should 
never give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair 
of the success of their endeavours, let the children be 
ever so obstinate, refractory, or to appearance insen- 
sible of instruction ; for if ever God in His providence 
touches the consciences of such, the force of their 
education returns upon them, and the early instnic* 
tion of parents is not lost, though it may have been 
many years laid adeep, but some time or other they 
may find the benefit of it 

Thus it was with this poor man. However igno- 
rant he was, or divested of rettgioa and Chrisdaa 
knowledge, he found he had some to do with now^ 
more ignorant than himself; and that the least part, 
of the instruction of his good father, that could aovr 
oome to his mind, was of use to him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how 
his father used to insist much upon the inexpressible 
value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of it 
to nations, families, and persons ; bat he never eiH 
tertained the least notion of the worth of it till iiow, 
when, being to talk to heatihens, savages, and bar* 
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for 
his assistance. 

The young woman was very glad of it also for the 
present occasion, though she had one, and so had the 



OF ROBINSON CR USOE. 19 5 

youth, on board our ship, among the goods which 

ircrc not yet brought on shore. And now, having 

said so many things of this young woman, I cannot 

omit telling one story more of her and myself, which 

has something in it very informing and remarkable. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young 
^woman was reduced ; how her mistress was starved 
'^o death, and did die on board that unhap[>y ship we 
xifiet at sea ; and how the whole ship's company being 
reduced to the last extremity, the gentlewoman and 
^er son, and this maid, were first hardly used as to 
"provisions, and at last totally neglected and starved ; 
*^hat is to say, brought to the last extremity of 
hunger. 

One day, being discoursing with her upon the 

extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could 

<lescribe, by what she felt, what it was to starve, and 

liow it appeared ? She told me she believed she could, 

and 5he told her tale very distinctly thus : 

*• First, sir," said she, " we had for some days fared 
exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger, but 
now at last we were wholly without food of any kind 
except sugar and a little wine and a little water. 
The first day after I had received no food at all, I 
found myself, towards evening, first empty and sickish 
at my stomach, and nearer night mightily inclined to 
yawning^ and sleepy ; I lay down on a couch in the 
great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and 
awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass of 
wine when I lay down. After being about three 
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morn'» 



196 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ing/ 1 found myself empty, and my stomach sickish 
again, and lay down again, but could not sleep at 
all, being very faint and ill ; and thus I continued all 
the second day with a strange variety — first hungry, 
then sick again, with retchings to vomit The second 
night, being obliged to go to bed again without any 
food more than a draught of fair water, and being 
asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the 
market was mightily stocked with provisions, that I 
bought some for my mistress, and went and dined 
very heartily. 

'' I thought my stomach was full after this, as it 
would have been after or at a good dinner; but 
when I waked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits 
to find myself in the extremity of famine ; the last 
glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar into itt 
because of its having some spirit to supply nourish- 
ment ; but there being no substance in the stomach 
for the digesting office to work upon, I found the 
only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable 
fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay, 
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, 
for some time. 

"The third day, in the morning, after a night of 
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and rather 
dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious 
with hunger; and I question, had not my under- 
standing returned and conquered it, I say, I ques- 
tion whether, if I had been a mother, and had had 
a little child with me, its life would have been safe 
or no. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I9)r 

"This lasted about three hours, during which 
time I was twice raging mad as any creature in 
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can 
now inform you. 

" In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction^ 
whether by the motion of the ship or some sh*p of 
my foot I know not, I fell down, and struck my face 
against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my 
mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed 
out of my nose, and the cabin-boy bringing me a 
little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great 
deal, and as the blood ran from me I came to my- 
self and the violence of the flame or the fever I 
xvas in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the 
liunger. 

•*Then I grew sick, and retched to vomit, but 

could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring 

up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and they 

all believed I was dead ; but I came to myself soon 

after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my 

stomach not to be described ; not like the colic, 

but a gnawing eager pain for food ; and towards 

night it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or 

longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the 

longing of a woman with child. I took another 

draught of water with sugar in it, but my stomach 

loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again ; then 

I took a draught of water without sugar, and that 

stayed with mie, and I laid me down upon the bed, 

praying most heartily that it would please God to 

take me away; and composing my mind in hopes of 



i98 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

it, I slumbered awhile; and then waking, thought 
myself dying, being light with vapours from an 
empty stomach ; I recommended my soul to God, 
and earnestly wished that somebody would thron 
me into the sea. 

"All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as 1 
thought expiring, but bore it with much more patience 
than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had to hei 
child, my young master, who would not have taken 
it, but she obliged him to eat it, and I believe it 
saved his life. 

'* Towards the morning I slept again, and first 
when I awaked I fell into a violent passion of crying 
and after that had a second fit of violent hunger, sc 
that I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful con- 
dition. Had my mistress been dead, so much as I 
loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a piece 
of her fiesh with as much relish, and as unconcerned, 
as ever I did the fiesh of any creature appointed for 
food ; and once or twice I was going to bite my own 
arm. At last I saw the basin in which was the 
blood I had bled at my nose the day before ; I ran 
to it, and swallowed it with such haste, and such a 
greedy appetite, as if I had wondered nobody had 
taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from 
me now. 

" Though, after it was down, the thoughts of it filled 
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and 
I drank a draught of fair water, and was composed 
and refreshed for some hours after it. This was the 
fourth day; and thus I held it till towards night 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19^ 

when, within the compass of three hours, I had all 
these several circumstances over again, one after 
another, viz., sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the 
stomach, then ravenous again, then sick again, then 
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every 
quarter of an hour ; and my strength wasted exceed-*^ 
ingly. At night I laid me down having no comfort 
but in the hope that I should die before morning. 

"All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was 
now turned into a disease, and I had a terrible colic 
and griping, wind instead of food having found its 
way into my bowels; and in this condition I lay till 
morning, when I was surprised a little with the cries 
and lamentations of my young master, who called 
out to me that his mother was dead« I lifted myself 
up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found 
she was not dead, though she was able to give very 
little signs of life. 

** I had then such convulsions in my stomach for 
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them, 
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite that 
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and 
thb condition I was in when I heard the seamen 
above cry out, 'A sail t a sail I' and halloo and jump 
about as if they were distracted. 

" I was not able to get off from the bed, and my 
mistress much less, and my master was so sick that 
I thought he had been expiring; so we could not 
open the cabin-door, or get any account what it was 
that occasioned such a combustipn ; nor had we any 
conversation with the ship's company for two day$> 



.20O THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they having told us they had not a mouthful of any- 
thing to eat in the ship ; and they told us afterwards 
they thought we had been dead. 

" It was this dreadful condition we were in when 
you were sent to save our lives ; and how you found 
us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too." 

This was her own relation ; and is such a distinct 
account of starving to death, as I confess I never met 
with, and was exceedingly entertaining to me : I am 
the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, be- 
cause the youth gave me an account of a good part of 
it ; though I must own not so distinct and so feelingly 
as his maid, and the rather because it seems his 
mother fed him at the price of her own life : but the 
poor maid, though her constitution being stronger 
than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a 
weakly woman too, she might struggle harder with 
it ; I say the poor maid might be supposed to feel 
the extremity something sooner than her mistress, 
•who might be allowed to keep the last bits something 
longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid. 
No question, as the case is here related, if our ship, or 
some other, had not so providentially met them, a few 
days more would have ended all their lives, unless they 
had prevented it by eating one another; and even 
that, as their case stood, would have served them but 
a little while, they being five hundred leagues from 
any land, or any possibility of relief, other than in 
the miraculous manner it happened. But this is by 
the way ; I return to my disposition of things among 
the people. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 201 

And first, it is to be observed here, that for many 
reasons I did not think fit to let them know anything 
of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of set* 
ting up among them ; for I found, at least at my first 
coming, such seeds of division among them, that I 
saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it 
among them, they would, upon very light disgust, 
have separated, and gone away from one another; 
or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the 
island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of 
sober and religious people, as I intended it to be; 
nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I 
had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns, that my 
nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason: I 
thought they had enough to qualify them for a de- 
fensive war, against any that should invade them ; 
but I was not to set them up for an offensive war, or 
to encourage them to go abroad to attack others, 
which, in the end, would only bring ruin and destruc- 
tion upon themselves and all their undertakings ; I 
reserved the sloop therefore, and the guns, for their 
service another way, as I shall observe in its place. 

I have now done with the island : I left them all 
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition^ 
and went on board my ship again the fifth day of 
May^ having been five-and-twenty days among them ; 
and, as they were all resolved to stay upon the island 
till I came to remove them, I promised to send some 
further relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly find 
an opportunity ; and particularly I promised to send 
them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows; for 



202 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

as to the two cows and calves which I brought from 
England, we had been obliged, by the length of our 
voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed 
them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns 
at parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All 
Saints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two da3rs; 
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this, 
that about three days after we sailed, being becalmed, 
and the current setting strong to the N.N»£., run- 
ning, as it were, into a bay or gulf on the landside, 
we were driven something out of our course ; and once 
or twice our men cried, Land to the westward ; but 
whether it was the continent, or islands, we could not 
tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth 
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, 
covered towards the land with something very black ; 
not being able to discover what it was; but, after 
some time, our chief mate going up the main shrouds 
a little way, and looking at them with a perspective, 
cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what 
he meant by an army, and spoke a little hastily, call- 
ing the fellow a fool, or some such word : •* Nay, sir," 
says he, " don't be angry, for it is an army, and a fleet 
too ; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and 
you may see them paddle along, and they are coming 
towards us too apace, and full of men." 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was 
my nephew, the captain; for he had heard such 
terrible stories of them in the island, and having 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 203 

never been in those seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but said two or three times^ 
we should all be devoured. I must confess, con- 
sidering we were becalmed, and the current set strong^ 
towards the shore, I liked it the worse; however, I 
bade him not be afraid, but bring the ship to an 
anchor, as soon as we came so near as to know that 
we must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on 

apace towards us; so I gave orders to come to an 

anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages, I 

told them they had nothing to fear from them but 

fire ; and therefore they should get their boats out, 

and fasten them, one close by the head, and the other 

by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the 

issue in that posture : this I did, that the men in the 

boats might be ready, with sheet and buckets, to 

put out any fire these savages might endeavour to 

fix upon the outside of the ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little 
while they came up with us ; but never was such a 
horrid sight seen by Christians : my mate was much 
mistaken in his calculation of their number, I mean 
of a thousand canoes; the most we could make of 
them, when they came up, being about 126; and a 
great many of them too ! for some of them had six« 
teen or seventeen men in them, some more, and the 
least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be 
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight 
which they had, doubtless, never seen before; nor 



feo4 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

could they, at first, as we afterwards understood, 
know what to make of us. They came boldly up, 
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about 
to row round us : but we called to our men in the 
boats not to let them come too near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement 
with them, without our designing it ; for five or six 
of their large canoes came so near our long-boat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep 
back; which they understood very well, and went 
back; but at their retreat about 500 arrows came 
on board us from those boats ; and one of our men 
in the long-boat was very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any 
means ; but we handed down some deal boards into 
the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind 
of a fence, like waist boards, to cover them from 
the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot 
again. 

About half an hour aflerwards they came all up 
in a body astern of us, and pretty near ; so near 
that we could easily discern what they were, though 
we could not tell their design. I easily found they 
were some of my old friends, the same sort of savages 
that I had been used to engage with ; and in a little 
time more they rowed somewhat further out to sea, 
till they came directly broadside with us, and then 
rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near 
that they could hear us speak. Upon this I ordered 
all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any 
more arrows, and make all our guns ready ; but being 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. * 205 

so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go 
out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his 
language, to know what they meant ; which accord- 
ingly he did : whether they understood him or not, 
that I know not; but as soon as he had called to 
them, six of them, who were in the foremost, or 
nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us ; and, 
stooping down, showed us their naked backsides ; 
just as if, in English (saving your presence), they had 

bid us kiss . Whether this was a defiance 

or challenge, we knew not ; or whether it was done in 
mere contempt, or a signal to the rest ; but imme- 
diately Friday cried out, they were going to shoot ; 
and unhappily for him (poor fellow !) they let fly 
about three hundred of their arrows ; and» to my 
inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man 
being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with 
no less than three arrows, and about three more 
fell very nigh him; such unlucky marksmen they 
were I 

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, 
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that 
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with 
small shot, and four with great ; and gave them such 
a broadside as they had never had in their lives 
before, to be sure. 

They were not above half a cable's length off when 
we flred ; and our gunners took their aim so well, 
that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we 
had reason to believe, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides 



2o6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to us, gave us no great offence : neither did I know 
for certain whether that, which would pass for Ae 
greatest contempt among us, might be understood so 
by them or not; therefore, in return, I had only re- 
solved to have fired four or five guns with powder 
only, which I knew would fright them sufficiently: 
but when they shot at us directly with ail the fury 
they were capable of, and especially as they had 
killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and 
valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it; I not 
only had been justified before God and man, but 
would have been very glad, if I could, to have over- 
set every canoe there and drowned every one of 
them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many 
we wounded, at this broadside ; but sure such a fright 
and hurry never was seen among such a multitude : 
there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split, 
and overset in all ; and the men all set a-swimraing ; 
the rest, frighted out of their wits, scoured away as 
fast as they could, taking but little care to save those 
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot : so I 
suppose that they were many of them lost ; and our 
men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, 
above an hour after they were all gone. 

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and 
wound a great many ; but, in short, we never knew 
anything how it went with them ; for they fled so fast, 
that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see 
above three or four straggling canoes ; nor did we ever 
see the rest any more ; for a breeze of wind springing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 207 

up the same evening, we weighed and set sail for the 

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so 
sailen, that he would neither eat nor speak ; and we 
all fancied he would starve himself to death ; but I 
took a way to cure him ; for I made them take hint 
and turn him into the long-boat, and make him be- 
lieve they would toss him into the sea again, and so 
leave him where they found him, if he would not 
speak : nor would that do, but they really did throw 
him into the sea, and came away from him ; and then 
he followed them, for be swam like a cork, and called 
to them in his tongue, though they knew not one 
word of what he said. However, at last, they took 
him in again, and then he began to be more tract- 
able; nor did I ever design they should drown him. 

We were now under sail again; but I was the 
OKXt disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man 
Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone 
back to the island, to have taken one of the rest from 
thence for my occasion ; but it could not be, so we 
went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said ; and 
it was a ioog while before we could make him under- 
stand anythiog ; but in time, our men taught him 
some English, and he began to be a little tractable : 
afterwards we inquired what cotmtry he came from, 
but could make nothing of what he said; for his 
speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoken in the 
throat, in soch a hollow and odd manner, that we 
could never form a word from him ; and we were all 
of opinion that they might speak that language as 



2o8 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

well if they were gagged, as otherwise ; nor could we 
perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, 
tongue, lips, or palate ; but fofmed their words just 
as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an open throat : 
he told us, however, some time after, when we had 
taught him to speak a little English, that they were 
going, with their kings, to fight a great battle. When 
he said kings, we asked him how many kings ? He 
said there were five nation (we could not make him 
understand the plural s\ and that they all joined to 
go s^inst two nation. We asked him. What made 
them come up to us ? He said, " To makee te great 
wonder look." — Where it is to be observed, that all 
those natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn 
English, they always add two ^'s at the end of the 
words where we use one, and place the accent upon 
the last of them ; as mdkee^ takee^ and the like : and 
we could not break them off it ; nay, I could hardly 
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
must take my last leave of him ; poor honest Friday ! 
We buried him with all decency and solemnity pos- 
sible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him 
into the sea ; and I caused them to fire eleven guns 
for him : and so ended the life of the most grateful, 
faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that ever 
man had. 

We now went away with a fair wind for Brazilf 
and in about twelve days' time we made land in the 
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the 
north-easternmost land of all that part of America^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. '20() 

We kept on S, by E. in sight of the shore four days, 
when we made the Cape St. Augustine, and in three 
days came to an anchor off the Bay of All Saints, 
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came 
both my good and evil fate. 

Never did a sh^p come to this part that had less 
business than I had ; and yet it was with great diffi- 
culty that we were admitted to hold the least cor- 
respondence on shore. Not my partner himself, who 
was alive, and made a great figure among them, not 
my two merchant trustees, nor the fame of my won- 
derful preservation in the island, could obtain me 
that favour : but my partner, remembering that I 
had given five hundred moidores to the prior of the 
monastery of the Augustines, and three hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, and 
obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor, 
and beg leave for me presently, with the captain, and 
one more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, 
and no more ; and this upon condition absolutely 
capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any 
goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away 
without license. 

They were so strict with us, as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got 
on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine 
broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had 
brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, broad -hearted man, 
though (like me) he came from little at first; and 
though he knew not that I had the least design of 

VOL. II. O

giving him anything, he sent me on board a pres 
of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, wc 
above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, ; 
three or four fine medals in gold. But I was e 
with him in my present, which, as I have said, c 
sisted of fine broadcloth, English stufTs, lace, < 
fine Hollands. Also, I delivered him about 
value of £ioo sterling, in the same goods for ot 
uses; and I obliged him to set up the sloop wfa 
I had brought with me from England, as I have s; 
for the use of my colony, in order to send the refrc 
ments I intended to my plantation.

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop 
in a very few days, for she was already framed ; and 
I gave the master of her such instructions as he could 
not miss the place ; nor did he miss it, as I had an 
account from my partner afterwards. I got him soon 
loaded with the small cargo I had sent them; and 
one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me 
there, offered to go with the sloop, and settle there, 
upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to allot 
him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation ; 
and giving him some clothes, and tools for his plant- 
ing work, which he said he understood, having been 
an old planter in Maryland, and a bucanier into the 
bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired ; 
and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we 
had taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered 



aij THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the governor Spaniard to give him his share of every- 
thing he wanted, with the rest. 

When we came to (it this man out, my old partner 
told me, there was a certain very honest fellow, a 
Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the displeasure of the Church : " I know not 
what the matter is with him," says he, " but, on my 
conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart : and 
be has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of 
the Inquisition ; " that he would be very glad of such 
ao opportunity to make his escape, with his wife 
and two daughters; and if I would let them go to 
the island, and allot them a plantation, he would 
give them a small stock to begin with; for the 
officers of the Inquisition had seized all his effects 
and estate, and he had nothing left but a little 
household'StufT and two slaves; "and," adds he, 
" though I hate his principles, yet I would not have 
him fall into their hands, for he will assuredly be 
burnt alive if he does." 

I granted this presently, and joined my English- 
man with them, and we concealed the man and bis 
wife and daughters on board our ship, till the sloop 
put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their 
goods on board the sloop some time before) we put 
them on board the sloop, after she was got out of the 
bay. 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new 
partner; and their stock, indeed, was much alike, 
rich in tools, and in preparations, for a farm; but 
nothing to begin with but as above. However, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 2 1 3 

they carried over with them (which was worth all 
the rest) some materials for planting sugar-canes, 
ivith some plants of canes; which he (I mean the 
Portugal man) understood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants 
in the island, I sent them, by this sloop, three milch- 
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among 
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a 
stone-horse. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go; and recom- 
mended it to them to marry them, and use them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I 
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two 
daughters, and there were but five of the Spaniards 
that wanted ; the rest had wives of their own, though 
in another country. 

All this cat^o arrived safe, and, as you may easily 
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who 
were now (with this addition) between sixty and 
seventy people, besides little children ; of which there 
was a great many : I found letters at London from 
them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to 
England, being sent back to the Brazils by this 
sloop; of which I shall take some notice in its place. 
I have now done with my island, and all manner 
of discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest 
of my memorandums, would do well to turn his 
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read only 
of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own 
harms, much less by those of other men, to beware 



214 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of the like; not cooled by almost forty years misery 
and disappointments; not satisfied with prosperity 
beyond expectation ; not made cautious by affliction 
and distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indiesi 
than a man at full liberty, and having committed no 
crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and 
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there, 
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from 
England, and gone directly to the island; had I 
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the 
necessaries for the plantation, and for my i>eoplc; 
took a patent from the Government here to have 
secured my property, in subjection only to that of 
England, which to be sure I might have obtained ; 
had I carried over cannon and ammunition, servants 
and people to plant, and, taken possession of the 
place, fortified and strengthened it in the name of 
England, and increased it with people, as I might 
easily have done; had I then settled myself there, 
and sent the ship back loaded with good rice, as I 
might also have done in six mopths' time, and or- 
dered my friends to have fitted her out again for our 
supply; had I done this, and stayed there myself, 
I had, at least, acted like a man of common sense: 
but I was possessed with a wandering spirit, scorned 
all advantages, pleased myself with being the patron 
of these people I had placed there, and doing for 
them in a kind of haughty majestic way, like an old 
patriarchal monarch ; providing for them, as if I bad 
been father of the whole family, as well as of the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

plantation : but I never so much as pretended to 
plant in the name of any government or nation, or 
to acknowledge any prince, or to call my people sub- 
jects to any one nation more than another; nay, I 
never so much as gave the place a name; but left 
it as I found it, belonging to no man ; and the 
people under no discipline or government but my 
own; who, though I had an influence over them as 
father and benefactor, had no authority or power to 
act or command one way or other, further than 
voluntary consent moved them to comply : yet even 
this, had I stayed there, would have done well 
enough ; but as I rambled from them, and came 
thither no more, the last letters I had from any of 
them were by my partner's means, who afterwards 
sent another sloop to the place ; and who sent me 
word, though I had not the letter till five years after 
it was written, that they went on but poorly, were 
malcontent with their long stay there ; that Will 
Atkins was dead; that five of the Spaniards were 
come away; and that though they had not been 
much molested by the savages, yet they had had 
some skirmishes with them; that they begged of 
him to write to me to think of the promise I had 
made to fetch them away, that they might see their 
own country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and they 
who will have any more of me, must be content to 
follow me through a new variety of follies, hardships, 
and wild adventures; wherein the justice of Provi- 
dence may be duly observed, and we may see how 



ai6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make 
the strongest of our wishes to be our affliction, and 
punish us most severely with those very things which 
we think it would be our utmost happiness to be 
allowed in. 

Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength 
of his own judgment, as if he were able to choose any 
particular station of life for himself. Man is a short- 
sighted creature, sees but a very little way before 
him ; and as his passions are none of his best friends, 
so his particular affections are generally his worst 
counsellors. 

I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I 
had from a youth to wander into the world, and how 
evident it now was that this principle was preserved 
in me for my punishment How it came on, the 
manner, the circumstance, and the conclusion of it, 
it is easy to give you historically and with its utmost 
variety of particulars. But the secret ends of Divine 
Providence, in thus permitting us to be hurried 
down the stream of our own desires, are only to be 
understood by those who can listen to the voice of 
Providence, and draw religious consequences from 
God's justice, and their own mistakes. 

Be it I had business or no business, away I went. 
It is no time now to enlarge any further upon the 
reason or absurdity of my own conduct; but to come 
to the history — I was embarked for the voyage, and 
the voyage I went. 

I shall only add here, that my honest and truly 
pious clergyman left me here ; a ship being ready to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

g^o to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither; being 
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voy- 
age he began. How happy had it been for me if I 
had gone with him. 

But it was too late now; all things Heaven ai> 
points are best. Had I gone with him, I had never 
had so many things to be thankful for, and you had 
never heard of the Second Part of the Travels and 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must leave 
here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on 
with my voyage. 

From the Brazils we made directly away over the 
Atlantic Sea to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or as 
we call it, the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a toler* 
able good voyage, our course generally south-east; 
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. 
But my disasters at sea were at an end ; my future 
rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore; 
that it might appear the land was as well prepared 
to be our scourge as the sea, when Heaven, who 
directs the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint 
it to be so. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a 
supercargo on board, who was to direct all her 
motions after she arrived at the Cape; only being 
limited to a certain number of days for stay, by 
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. 
This was none of my business, neither did I meddle 
with it at all ; my nephew, the captain, and the super- 
cargo, adjusting all those things between them as 
they thought fit 



2i8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was 
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best 
of our way for the coast of Coromandel ; we were 
indeed informed that a French man-of-war of fifty 
guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone 
for the Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with 
France, I had some apprehensions of them ; but they 
went their own way, and we heard no more of them. 

I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with 
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, varia- 
tions of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances, 
trade-winds, situation of ports, and the like ; such as 
almost all the histories of long navigation are full of, 
and which make tlie reading tiresome enough, and 
are perfectly unprofitable to all that read, except 
only to those who are to go to those places them- 
selves. 

It is enough to name the ports and places which 
we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our 
passing from one to another. We touched first at 
the island of Madagascar, where, though the people 
are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very 
well armed with lances and bows, which they use 
with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well 
with them awhile ; they treated us very civilly ; and 
for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, 
scissors, &c, they brought us eleven good fat bul- 
locks, middling in size, but very good in flesh, which 
we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present 
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here for some time after 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

we had furniished ourselves with provisions; and I, 
that was always too curious to look into every nook 
of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore 
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the 
island that we went on shore one evening, and the 
people, who by the way are very numerous, came 
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 
distance; as we had traded freely with them, and 
bad been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no 
danger; but when we saw the people, we cut three 
boughs out of a tree and stuck them up at a distance 
from us, which, it seems, is a mark in the country 
not only of truce and friendship, but when it is ac- 
cepted, the other side set up three poles or boughs 
also, which is a signal that they accept the truce too ; 
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that 
you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards 
them, nor they come past your three poles or boughs 
towards you ; so that you are perfectly secure within 
the three poles, and all the space between your poles 
and theirs is allowed, like a market, for free converse, 
traffic, and commerce. When you go thither you 
must not carry your weapons with you ; and if they 
come into that space, they stick up their javelins and 
lances all at the first poles, and come on unarmed > 
but if any violence is offered them, and the truce 
thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay 
hold of their weapons, and then the truce is at an 
end. 

It happened one evening when we went on shore, 
that a greater number of their people came down 



220 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

than usual, but all was very friendly and civil. 
They brought with them several kinds of provisions! 
for which we satisfied them with such toys as we 
had ; their women also brought us milk and roots, 
and several things very acceptable to us, and all 
was quiet ; and we made us a little tent or hut, of 
some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all that night. 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not 
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the 
boat lying at an anchor about a stone's cast from 
the land, with two men in her to take care of her, 
I made one of them come on shore, and getting 
some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I 
spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay 
on board, under the cover of the branches of the 
trees, all night. 

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one 
of our men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling 
out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and come 
and help them, for they were all like to be murdered ; 
at the same time I heard the firing of five muskets, 
which was the number of the guns they had, and 
that three times over; for, it seems, the natives 
here were not so easily frighted with guns as the 
savages were in America, where I had to do with 
them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter; 
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I 
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with 
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist our 
men. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 221 

We got the boat soon to the shore ; but our men 
were in too much haste ; for, being come to the shore, 
they plunged into the water to get to the boat with 
all the expedition they could, being pursued by be- 
tween three and four hundred men. Our men were 
but nine in all, and only five of them had fusils with 
them : the rest, indeed, had pistols and swords, but 
they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty 
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded ; 
and th^t which was still worse was, that while we 
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on shore; for they 
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were 
fain to barricade the side of the boat up with the 
benches and two or three loose boards, which, to our 
great satisfaction, we had by mere accident, or provi- 
dence rather, in the boat. 

And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems, 
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen 
but the least part of any of us, they would have been 
sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a 
little sight of them as they stood pelting us from the 
shore with darts and arrows ; and having got ready 
our firearms, we gave them a volley, and we could 
hear by the cries of some of them that we had 
wounded several ; however, they stood thus in battle- 
array on the shore till break of day, which we sup- 
pose was that they might see the better to take their 
aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to 



222 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must 
needs stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to 
hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small 
shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, which 
though she rode a league off, yet my nephew, the 
captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving 
the posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the 
shore, pretty well understood us ; and weighing 
anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as 
he durst with the ship, and then sent another boat 
with ten hands in her to assist us ; but we called to 
them not to come too near, telling them what con- 
dition we were in. However, they stood in nearer to 
us ; and one of the men taking the end of a tow-line 
in his hand, and keeping our boat between him and 
the enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, 
swam on board us, and made the line fast to the boat, 
upon which we slipped our little cable, and leaving our 
anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of the 
arrows, we all the while lying close behind the barri- 
cade we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and 
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we 
ran along just by them, and we poured in a broadside 
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, 
small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot, 
which made a terrible havoc among them. 

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we 
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray; 
and indeed our supercargo, who had been often in 
those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he was sure the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 223 

inhabitants would not have touched us after we had 
made a truce, if we had not done something to pro- 
voke them to it. At length it came out, viz., that an 
old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had 
brought it within our poles, with a young woman with 
her, who also brought some roots or herbs; and while 
the old woman (whether she was mother to the young 
woman or no they could not t.ell) was selling us the 
milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to the 
wench that was with her, at which the old woman 
made a great noise. However, the seaman would not 
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's 
sight, among the trees, it being almost dark. The old 
woman went away without her, and, as we suppose, 
made an outcry among the people she came from ; 
who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in 
three or four hours ; and it was great odds but we 
had been all destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was 

thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack, 

as he sallied out of the tent we had made ; the rest 

came off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion 

of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his 

black mistress, for we could not hear what became 

of him a great while. We lay upon the shore two 

days after, though the wind presented, and made 

."^ignals for him; made our boat sail up shore and 

down shore several leagues, but in vain ; so we were 

oblicred to give him over; and if he alone had suf- 

fered for it, the loss had been the less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven- 



224 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

turing on shore once more, to try if I could learn 
anything of him or them. It was the third night 
after the action, that I had a great mind to learn, 
if I could by any means, what mischief we had done, 
and how the game stood on the Indian side. I was 
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be at- 
tacked again ; but I ought indeed to have been sure 
that the men I went with had been under my com- 
mand before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and 
mischievous, as I was brought into it without my 
knowledge or desire. 

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in 
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and 
we landed two hours before midnight, at the same 
place where the Indians stood drawn up the evening 
before. I landed here, because my design, as I 
have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the 
field, and if they had left any marks behind them, or 
of the mischief we had done them ; and I thought if 
we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we 
might get our man again by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our 
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain 
commanded one, and I the other. We neither could 
hear nor see anybody stir when we landed; so we 
marched up, one body at a distance from the other, 
to the field of battle. At first we could see nothing, 
it being very dark; but by and by our boatswain, 
that led the first party, stumbled and fell over a 
dead body. This made them halt there awhile; for 
knowing by the circumstances that they were at the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 225 

place where the Indians had stood, they waited for 
my coming up. Here we concluded to halt till the 
moon began to rise, which we knew would be in less 
than an hour, and then we could easily discern the 
havoc we had made among them. We told two-and- 
thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not 
quite dead. Some had an arm, and some a leg^, 
shot off, and one his head ; those that were wounded 
we supposed they had carried away. 

When wc had made^ as I thought, a full discovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for 
going on board again ; but the boatswain and his 
party often sent me word, that they were resolved 
to make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, 
as they called them, dwelt, and desired me to go 
along with them, and if they could find them, as 
they still fancied they should, they did not doubt, 
they said, getting a good booty, and it might be they 
might find Thomas JefTrys there, — that was the man's 
name we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew 
well enough what answer to have given them ; for 
I would have commanded them instantly on board, 
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who 
had a ship and a ship's loading in our charge, and a 
voyage to make which depended very much upon 
the lives of the men ; but as they sent me word they 
were resolved to go, and only asked . me and my 
company to go along with them, I positively refused 
it, and rose up (for I was sitting on the ground) in 
order to go to the boat One or two of the men 
VOL. II. P 






226 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

began to importune me to go, and when I still tc- 
fused positively, began to grumble, and say tl^cy 
were not under my command, and they would go. 
" Come, Jack," says one of the men, " will you go 
with me? I will go for one." Jack said he woi-«l(i; 
and another followed, and then another ; and, i sn a 
word, they all left me but one, whom, with m ^jch 
difficulty, too, I persuaded to stay ; so the supercai.:M'go 
and I, with one man, went back to the boat, wlm^cre, 
I told them, we would stay for them, and take cr^re 
to take in as many of them as should be left; for/ 
told them it was a mad thing they were going abouf, 
and supposed most of them would run the fate of 
Thomas J effrys. 

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant \i 
they would come off again, and they would take 
care, &c. So away they went. I entreated them to 
consider the ship and the voyage; that their lives 
were not their own ; and that they were entrusted 
with the voyage in some measure j that if they mis- 
carried, the ship might be lost for want of their help; 
and that they could not answer it to God and man. 
I said a great deal more to them on that head, but I 
might as well have talked to the mainmast of the 
ship ; they were mad upon their journey; only they 
gave me good words, and begged I would not be 
angry ; said they would be very cautious, and they 
did not doubt but they Would be back again in about 
an hour at furthest ; for the Indian town, they said, 
was not above half a mile off; though they found it 
^bove two miles before they got to it 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 227 

Well, they all went away as above ; and though 
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but 
madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them 
their due, they went about it warily as well as boldly. 
They were gallantly armed, that is true; for they 
had every man a fusil or musket, a bayonet, and 
every matt a pistol ; some of them had broad cut- 
lasses, some of them hangers, and the boatswain and 
two more had pole-axes ; besides all which, they had 
among them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder fel- 
lows, and better provided, never went about any 
wicked work in the world. 

When they went out, their chief design was plunder, 
and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ,' 
hut a circumstance, which none of them were aware 
of, set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of 
them all. 

When they came to the few Indian houses, which 
they thought had been the town, which were not 
above half a mile off, they were under a great dis- 
appointment; for there were not above twelve or 
thirteen houses; and where the town was, or how 
big, they knew not. They consulted therefore what 
to do, and were some time before they could resolve; 
for, if they fell upon these, they must cut all their 
throats, and it was ten to one but some of them 
might escape, it being in the night, though the moon 
was up ; and if one escaped, he would run away, and 
raise all the town, so they should have a whole army 
upon them. Again, on the other hand, if they went 
away, and left those untouched (for the people were 



228 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

all asleep), they could not tell which way to look for 
the town. 

However, the last was the best advice ; so they 
resolved to leave those houses, and look for the town 
as well as they could. They went on a little way, 
and found a cow tied to a tree : this they presently 
concluded would be a good guide to them ; for they 
said the cow certainly belonged to the town before 
them, or the town behind them, and if they untied 
her, they should see which way she went : if she went 
back, they had nothing to say to her, but if she went 
forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her; 
so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, 
and the cow went on before them. In a word, the 
cow led them directly to the town, which, as they 
reported, consisted of above two hundred houses or 
huts ; and in some of these they found several families 
living together. 

Here they found all silent ; as profoundly secure as 
sleep and a country that had never seen an enemy of 
that kind could make them. Upon this they called 
another council to consider what they had to do, and 
in a word they resolved to divide themselves into three 
bodies, and to set three houses on fire in three parts 
of the town ; and as the men came out, to seize them 
and bind them; if any resisted, they need not be 
asked what to do then, and so to search the rest of 
the houses for plunder; but resolved to march silently 
first through the town, and see what dimensions it 
was of, and consider if they might venture upon it 
or no. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 229 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they 
would venture upon them; but while they were ani- 
mating one another to the work, three of them that 
were a little before the rest called out aloud, and told 
them they had found Thomas JeffrJ^s; they all ran 
up to the place ; and so it was indeed, for there they 
found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one arm, 
and his throat cut. There was an Indian house just 
by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of 
the principal Indians, who had been concerned in the 
fray with us before, and two or three of them wounded 
with our shot; and our men found they were awake, 
and talking one to another in' that house, but knew 
not their number. ^ 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en- 
raged them, as before, thalt they swore to one another 
they would be revenged, and that not an Indian who 
came into their hands should have quarter; and to 
work they went immediately, and yet not so madly 
as by the rage and fury they were in might be ex- 
pected. Their first care was to get something that 
would soon take fire ; but after a little search they 
found that would be to no purpose, for most of the 
houses were low, aind thatched with flags or rushes, 
of which the country is full: so they presently made 
some wildfire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder 
in the palms of their hands ; and in a quarter of an 
hour they set the town on fire in four or five places, 
and particularly that house where the Indians were 
not gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze, 
the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save 



230 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt, and 
especially at the door, where they drove them back, 
the boatswain himself killing one or two with his pole- 
axe ; the house being large, and many in it, he did 
not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenado, and 
threw it among them, which at first frighted them; 
but when it burst, made such havoc among them, that 
they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open 
part of the house were killed or hurt with the grenado^ 
except two or three more, who pressed to the door^ 
which the boatswain and two more kept with the 
bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and de- 
spatched all who came that way. But there was 
another apartment in the house, where the prince 
or king, or whatsoever he was, and several others, 
were ; and they kept in till the house, which was by 
this time all of a light flame, fell i^ upon them, an4 
they were smothered or burned together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they 
would not waken the people faster than they could 
master them ; but the fire beg:an to waken them fast 
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all 
the houses being made of light combustible stuff, 
that they could hardly bear the street between them, 
and their business was to follow the fire for the surer 
execution. As fast as the fire either forced the people 
out of those houses which were burning, or frighted 
them out of others, our people were ready at their 
doors to knock them on the head, still calling an^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. x^\^ 

hallooing to one another to remember Thomas 
Jeffrys. 

While this was doing, I must confess I was very 
Uneasy, and especially when I saw the flames of the 
town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by 

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his 
nien too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not 
l<nowing what the matter was, or what danger I 
Was in ; especially hearing the guns too, for by this 
X\mt they began to use their iirearnis. A thousand 
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the 
supercargo, what should l^ecome of us ; and at last, 
though he could ill spare any more men, yet, not 
Icnowing what exigence we might be in, he takes. 
another boat, and with thirteen me;i and himself,, 
comes on shore to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo 
in the boat with no inor<^ than two men, for one had 
been left to keep the boat; and though he was glad, 
that we were well, yet he was in the same impatience 
with us to know what wa? dpingi for the noise con- 
tinued, and the flame increased. I confess it was 
next to an impossibility for any men in the world to 
restrain their curiosity of knowing what had happened, 
or their concern for the safety of the men. In a word, 
the captain told me he wou\d go and help his men, 
let what would come, I argued with him, as I did 
b^fpre; with the men, the safety of the ship, and the 
danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners and 
merchants, &c^.and told him I would go, and the twq 



\ 



232 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

men, and only see if we could, at a distance, learn 
what was like to be the event, and come back and 
tell him. ' 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to 
talk to the rest before ; he would go, he said, and he 
only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for 
he could not think of having his men lost for want of 
help ; he had rather, he said, lose the ship, the voyage, 
and his life/ and all: and so away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to stay behind now than 
I was to persuade them not to go before; so, in 
short, the captain ordered two men to row back the 
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the ship, 
leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that when 
they came back, six men shbuld keep the two boats, 
and six more come' after us, so that he left only 
sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship's com- 
pany consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were 
lost in the first quarrel which brought this mischief 
on.- 

Being now on the march, you - may be sure we felt 
little of the ground we trod on, and being guided by 
the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the 
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was 
surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people 
were now quite of another nature, and filled us with 
horror. I must confess I never was at the sacking of 
a city, or at the taking of a town by storm; I have 
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ire- 
land, and killing man, woman, and child, and I had 
read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdebourg, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

and cutting the throats of 22,000 of both sexes ; but 
I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is 
it possible to describe it, or the horror which was 
upon our minds at hearing it 

However, we went on, and at length came to the 
town, though there was no entering the streets of it 
for the fire. ' The first object we met with was the 
niins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for 
the house was consumed ; and just before it, plain 
now to be seen by the h'ght of the fire, lay four men 
and three women killed ; and, as we thought, one or 
two more lay in the heap among the fire. In short, 
these were such instances of a rage altogether bar- 
barous, and of a fury something beyond what was 
iiuman, that we thought it impossible our men could 
b>e guilty of it ; or, if they were the authors of it, we 
tihought that everyone of them ought to be put to 
X\i^ worst of deaths : but this was not all ; we saw 
the fire increased forward, and the cry went on just 
^s the fire went on, so that we were in the utmost 
confusion. We advanced a little way further, and 
beheld, to our astonishment, three women naked, 
crying in a most dreadful manner, and flying as if 
they had indeed had wings, and after them sixteen 
or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and 
consternation, with three of our English butchers 
(for I can call them no better) in the rear, who when 
they could not overtake them, fired in among them, 
and one that was killed by their shot fell down in 
our sight: when the rest saw us, believing us to be 
their enemies^ and that we would murder them as 



234 THE LIFE AND AD VENTURES 

well as those that pursued them, they set up a most 
dreadful shriek, especially the women, and two of 
them fell down as if already dead with the fright 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood 
ran chill in my veins, when I saw this; and I believe 
had the three English sailors that pursued them 
come on, I had made our men kill th^m all. How- 
ever, we took some ways to let the poor flying crea- 
tures know that we would not hurt them, and im- 
mediately they came up to us, and kneeling down, 
with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation^ 
to us to save them, which we let them know we would 
do; whereupon they kept altogether in a huddle 
close behind us for protection. I left my men drawn 
up together, and charged them to hurt nobody, but 
if possible to get at some of our people, and see what 
devil it was possessed them, and what they intended 
to do; and, in a word, to comniand them off, assur- 
ing them, that if they stayed till daylight, they 
would have a hundred thousand men about their 
ears : I say' I left them and went among those flying 
people, taking only two of our men with me; and 
there was indeed a piteous spectacle among them: 
some of them had their feet terribly burnt with 
trampling and running through the flre, others their 
hands burnt : one of the women had fallen down in 
the flre, and was almost burnt to death before she 
could get out again; two or three of the men had 
cuts in their backs and thighs, from our men pursu- 
ing, and another was shot through th^ body, lo&d 
died while I was there. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 23; 

. I would fain have learnt what the occasion of all 
this was, but I could not understand one word they 
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them 
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I wa^ 
so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous at- 
tempt, that I could not stay there, but went back 
to my own men: I told them my resolution, and 
commanded them to follow me, when in the very 
moment came four of our men, with the boatswain 
at their head, running over the heaps of bodies they 
had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if 
they wanted more people to massacre, when our 
men hallooed to them as loud as they could 
halloo, and with much ado one of them made them 
hear, so that they knew who we were, and came 
up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a 
halloO) like a shout of triumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come; and without bearing to 
hear me, ■* Captain," says he, " noble captain, I am 
glad you are come ; we have not half done yet : 
villains !' hell-hound dogs ! I will kill as many of 
them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We 
have sworn to spare none of them ; we will root out 
the very name of them from the earth.** And thus 
he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would 
not give us leave; to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence 
him a little, " Barbarous dog ! " said I, " what arc you 
doing? I won't have one creature touched more 
upon pain of death. I charge you upon your lif^ 



236 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are 
a dead man this minute." 

" Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, 
or what they have done ? If you want a reason for 
what we have done, come hither;" and with that he 
showed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree, with 
his throat cut

CRUELTIES PRACTISED AT MADAGASCAR — FJVE MEN 
LOST ON THE ARABIAN SHOREy OFF THE GULP OF

AND PURCHASE A VESSEL^ WHICH, IT TURNS OUT, THE 
CREW HAD MUTINIED AND RAN AWAY WITH, . 

I CONFESS I was urged then myself, and at another 
time should have been forward enough ; but I thought 
they had carried their rage too far, and thought of 
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, " Cursed 
be their anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, 
for it was cruel." But I had now a new task upon 
my hands; for when the men I carried with me 
saw the sight as I had done, I had as much to do to 
restrain them, as I should have had with the others; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^yj 

nay, my nephew himself fell in with then), and told 
me in their hearing, that he was only concerned for 
fear of the men being overpowered; for as to the 
people, he thought not one of them ought to live ; 
for they had all glutted themselves with the murder 
of the poor man, and that they ought to be used 
like murderers. Upon these words away ran eight 
of my men with the boatswain and his crew, to com- 
plete their bloody work; and I, seeing it quite out 
of my power to restrain them, came away pensive 
and sad, for I could not bear the sight, much less 
the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches 
that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the super- 
cargo and two men, and with these I walked back 
to the boats. It was a very great piece of folly in 
me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone ; for 
as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had 
run over the country, there stood about forty men, 
armed with lances and bows, at the little place where 
the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned be- 
fore ; but by accident, I missed the place, and came 
directly to the seaside; and by that time I got to 
the seaside ,it was broad day: immediately I took 
the pinnace and went aboard, and sent her back to 
assist the men in what might happen. 

I observed, that about the time I came to the 
boat-side, the fire was pretty well out, and the noise 
abated ; but in about half an hour after I got on 
board, I heard a volley of our men's firearms, and 
saw a great smoke ; this, as I understood afterwards, 



238 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

was our men falling upon the forty men, who, as I 
said, stood at .the few houses on the way ; of whom 
they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all those 
houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women 
or children. 

By the time the men got to the shore again with 
the pinnace, our men began to appear: they came 
dropping in some and some, not in two bodies, and 
in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, straggling 
liere and there in such a manner that a small force 
of resolute men might have cut them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole country. 
The people were amazed and surprised,and sofrighted, 
that I believe a hundred of them would have fled 
at the sight of but five of our men. Nor in all this 
terrible action was there a man who made any con- 
siderable defence ; they were so surprised between 
the terror of the fire, and the sudden attack of our 
men in the dark, that they knew not which way to 
turn themselves; for if they fled one way, they were 
met by one party, if back again, by another ; so that 
they were everywhere knocked down. Nor did any 
of our men receive the least hurt, except one who 
strained his foot, and another had one of his hands 
Very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, 
and indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with 
him in particular, as well for his acting so out of 
his duty, as commander of the ship, and having the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting 
rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 239 

and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me 
very respectfully, but told me that when he saw the 
body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered 
in such a cruel and barbarous manner, he was not 
master of himself, neither could he govern his pas- 
sion; he owned he should not have done so, as he 
was commander of the ship, but as he was a man, 
and nature moved him, he could not bear it. As for 
the rest of the men, they were not subject to me at 
all, and they knew it well enough, so th^y took no 
notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed ; some said one thing, some 
another; but, according to the best of their accounts, 
put all together, they killed or destroyed about a 
hundred and fifty people, men, women, and children, 
and left not a house standing in the town. 

As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffrys, as he was 
quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head 
was half off, it would do him no service to bring him 
away; so they left him where they found him, only 
took him down from the tree where he was hanged 
bv one hand. 

However just our men thought this action to be, 
I was against them in it, and I always after that 
time told them God would blast the voyage; for I 
looked upon the blood they shed that night to be 
murder in them ; for though it is true that they 
killed Thomas Jeffrys, yet it was as true that Jeffrys 
was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had 



340 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

violated or debauched a young woman of theirs, who 
came to our camp innocently, and on the faith of 
their capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board. He said, it was true that 
we seemed to break the truce, but really had not, 
and that the war was begun the night before by the 
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed 
one of our men without any just provocation; so 
that as we were in a capacity to fight them, we might 
also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them 
in an extraordinary manner; that, though the poor 
man had taken liberty with a wench, he ought not to 
have been murdered, and that in such a villanous man- 
ner ; and that they did nothing but what was just, and 
what the laws of God allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough 
to have warned us against going on shore among 
heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to 
make mankind wise but at their own experience; 
and their experience seems to be always of most 
use to them when it is dearest bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulf, of Persia, and 
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to 
touch at Surat ; but the chief of the supercargo's 
design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where, if he missed 
of the business outward-bound, he was to go up to 
China, and return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf 
of Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore 
on the Arabian side of the Gulf, were surrounded by 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 241 

the Arabs, and either all killed or carried away into 
slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to 
rescue them, and had but just time to get off their 
boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retri^ 
bution of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain 
very warmly told me, he thought I went farther in 
my censures than I could show any warrant for in 
Scripture, and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke, 
ver. 4, where our Saviour intimates that those men 
on whom the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners 
above all the Galileans ; but that which indeed put 
me to silence in this cas6 was, that none of these 
five men who were now lost, were of the number of 
those who went on shore to the massacre of Mada- 
gascar (so I always called it, though our men could 
not bear the word massacre with any patience) ; and 
indeed this last circumstance, as I have said, put me 
to silence for the present. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this sub- 
ject had worse consequences than I expected; and 
the boatswain, who had been the head of the at- 
tempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me 
he found that I continually brought that affair upon 
the stage, that I made unjust reflections upon it, and 
had used the men very ill on that account, and him- 
self in particular; that I was but a passenger, and 
had no command in the ship, or concern in the 
Voyage, they were not obliged to bear it ; that they 
did not know but I might have some ill design in 
my head, and perhaps call them to an account for it 
when they came to England ; and that, therefore, un- 

VOL. II. Q 



243 THE UFE AAD ADVENTURES 

less I would resolve to have done with it^ and also 
not to concern myself farther with hinii or any of his 
afiairsi he would leave the ship, for he did not think 
it was safe to sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, 
and then tpld him that I did confess I had all along 
opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would 
always call it; and that I had on all occasions spoken 
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him 
than any of the rest ; that as to my having no com* 
mand in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise 
any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my 
mind in things which publicly concerned us all ; as to 
what concern I had in the voyage, that was none of 
his business ; I was a considerable owner of the ship, 
and in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak 
even further than I had yet done, and would not be 
accountable to him or any one else; and b^^n to be 
a little warm with him ; he made but little reply to 
me at that time, and I thought that affair had been 
over. We were at this time in the road to Bengal ; 
and being willing to see the place, I went on shore 
with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert 
myself; and towards evening was preparing to go 
on board, when one of the men came to me, and toM 
me he would not have me trouble myself to come 
down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry 
me on board. Any one may guess what a surprise 1 
was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the 
man who bade him deliver that errand to me? He 
told me, the coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 343 

bot tud htm let th«in know he had delivered his mes- 
sage, and that I had giv«n him no answer to it 

I immediately went and found out the supercai^o, 
and told him the story, adding, what I presently fore- 
sav, viz., that there would certainly be a mutiny in 
the ship ; and entreated him to go immediately on 
board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the 
captain of it; but I might have spared this intel- 
ligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore, 
the matter was effected on board; the boatswain, 
the gunner, the carpenter, and, in a word, all the 
inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, 
came up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak 
with the captain ; and there the boatswain making 
a long harangue (for the fellow talked very well), 
and repeating all be had said to me, told the captain 
in a few words, that as I was now gone peaceably on 
shore, they were loath to use any violence with me ; 
which, if I had not gone on shore, they would other- 
wise have done, to oblige me to have gone. They 
therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped 
themselves to serve in the ship under his command, 
they wonld perform it faithfully : but if I would not 
quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they 
would all leave the ship, and sail no further with 
him ; and at that word ALL, he turned his face about 
towards the mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal 
agreed on between them, at which all the seamen 
being got together, ttiey cried out, " One and ALL, 
One and all 1 " 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and 



244 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of great presence of mind ; and though he was sur- 
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly he would consider of the matter, but 
that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to 
me about it : he used some arguments with them, to 
show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the 
thing, but it was all in vain ; they swore, and shook 
hands round, before his face, that they would go all 
on shore unless he would engage to them not to 
suffer me to come on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his 
obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; so he began to talk cavalierly to them ; told 
them that I was a very considerable owner of the 
ship, and that in justice he could not put me out of 
my own house ; that this was next door to serving 
me as the famous pirate Kid had done, who made 
the mutiny in the ship, set the captain on shore on 
an uninhabited island, and ran away with the ship ; 
that let them go into what ship they would, if ever 
they came to England again it would cost them 
dear; that the ship was mine, and that he would 
not put me out of it ; and that he would rather lose 
the ship, and the voyage too, than disoblige me so 
much; so they might do as they pleased. How- 
ever, he would go on shore, and talk with me there, 
and invited the boatswain to go with him, and per- 
haps they might accommodate the matter with me. 

But they all rejected the proposal ; and said, they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, 
neither on board nor on shore; and if I came on 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

board, they would go on shore. '* Well," said the 
captain, *' if you are all of this mind, let me go on 
shore, and talk with him : " so away he came to me 
with this account, a little after the message had been 
brought to me from the coxswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess ; 
for I was not without apprehensions that they would 
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with 
the ship ; and then I had been stripped naked, in a 
remote country, and nothing to help myself: in 
short, I had been in a worse case than when I was 
all alone in the island. 

But they had not come to that length, it seems, 
to my great satisfaction ; and when my nephew told 
me what they had said to him, and how they had 
sworn, and shook hands, that they would one and 
all leave the ship if I was suffered to come on board, 
I told him he should not be concerned at it at all, 
for I would stay on shore ; I only desired he would 
take care and send me all my necessary things on 
shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and 
I would find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew ; 
but there was no way to help it but to comply with 
it. So, in short, he went on board the ship again, 
and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to 
their importunity, and had sent for his goods from 
on board the ship. So the matter was over in a 
very few hours ; the men returned to their duty, and 
I began to consider what course I should steer. 
. I was now alone, in the remotest part of the 



246 THE UFB AND ADVENTURES 

world, as I think I may call it, for I was near three 
thousand leagues, by sea, farther off from England 
than I was at my island ; only, it is true, I might 
travel here by land, over the Great Mogul's country 
to Surat ; might go from thence to Bassora by sea, 
up the Gulf of Persia, and from thence might take 
the way of the caravans, over the deserts of Arabia, 
to Aleppo and Scanderoon, and from thence by sea 
again to Italy, and so overland into France; and 
this, put together, might be, at least, a full diameter 
of the globe ; but if it were to be measured, I sup- 
pose it would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me» which was to wait 
for some English ships, which were coming to Bengal 
from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get: 
passage on board them for England : but as I cam^ 
hither without any concern with the English Eas^ 
India Company, so it would be difficult to go frooK. 
hence without their license, unless with great favour 
of the captains of the ships, or of the Company's 
factors ; and to both I was an otter stranger. 

Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by 
contrarieties, to see the ship set sail without me ; a 
treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances scarce 
ever met with, except from pirates running away 
with a ship, and setting those that would not agree 
with their villany on shore ; indeed, this was the next 
door to it both ways. However, my nephew left me 
two servants, or rather, one companion and one 
servant : the first was clerk to the purser, whom he 
engaged to go with me ; and the other was his own 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 247 

servant. I took me also a good lodging in the house 
of an English woman, where several merchants 
lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, 
and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough 
entertained; and that I might not be said to run 
rashly upon anjrthing, I stayed here above nine 
months, considering what course to take, and how to 
manage myself. I had some English goods with me 
of value, and a considerable sum of money; my 
nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of 
eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occa- 
sion, that I might not be straitened, whatever might 
happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage 
too ; and, as I originally intended, I bought here 
some very good diamonds, which of all other things, 
was the most proper for me in my circumstances, 
because I might always carry my whole estate about 
me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made 
for my return to England, but none falling to my 
mind, the English merchant who lodged with me, 
and with whom I had contracted an intimate ac- 
quaintance, came to me one morning: "Country- 
man," says he, ^ I have a project to communicate to 
you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for 
aught I know, suit with yours also, when you shall 
have thoroughly considered it 

" Here we are posted," says he, " you by accident, 
and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very 
remote from our own country ; but it is in a country 



248 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

where, by us who understand trade and business, a 
great deal of money is to be got ; if you will put a 
thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will 
hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds ; 
you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we will 
go a trading voyage to China ; for what should we 
stand still for ? The whole world is in motion, 
rolling round and round ; all the creatures of God, 
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent : 
why should we be idle? There are no drones," 
says he, '' living in the world but men : why should 
we be of that number ? " 

I liked this proposal very well; and the more 
because it seemed to be expressed with so much 
good-will and in so friendly a manner. I will not 
say, but that I might, by my loose and unhinged 
circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a proposal 
for trade, and indeed for anything else; or other- 
wise trade was none of my element; however, I 
might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade 
was not my element, rambling was ; and no proposal 
for seeing any part of the world, which I had never 
seen before, could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a 
ship to our mind ; and when we got a vessel, it was 
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so 
many as were necessary to govern the voyage, and 
manage the sailors which we should pick up there. 
After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and 
a gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and three 
Portuguese foremast-men ; with these we found we 



OJ^ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 249 

could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as 
they are, to make up. 

There are so many travellers who have written the 
history of their voyages and travels this way, that 
it would be but very little diversion to anybody to 
give a long account of the places we went to, and 
the people who inhabit there: those things I leave 
to others, and refer the reader to those journals and 
travels of Englishmen, many of which, I find, are 
published, and more promised every day. It is 
enough for me to tell you, that we made the voyage 
to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, first ; and from 
thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our 
wares for opium, and some for arrack; the first a 
commodity which bears a great price among the 
Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much 
wanted there : in a word, we went up to Susham ; 
made a very great voyage ; were eight months out ; 
and returned to Bengal ; and I was very well satisfied 
with my adventure. 

I observe that our people in England often admire 
how the officers, which the Company send into India, 
and the merchants which generally stay there, get 
such very good estates as they do, and sometimes 
come home worth sixty, seventy, and a hundred 
thousand pounds at a time. But it is no wonder, 
or, at least we shall see so much farther into it, 
when we consider the innumerable ports and places 
where they have a free commerce, that it will then be 
00 wonder ; and much less will it be so, when we 
consider, that at all those places and ports where the 



250 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

English ships come, there is so much, and such con- 
stant demand for the growth of all other countries, 
that there is a certain vent for the return, as well as a 
market abroad for the goods carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got 
so much money by the first adventure, and such an 
tnsight into the method of getting more, that, had 
I been twenty years younger, I should have been 
tempted to have stayed here, and sought no further 
for making my fortune : but what was all this to a 
man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich 
enough^ and came abroad more in obedience to a 
restless desire of seeing the world, than a covetous 
desire of getting in it ? And indeed I think it is 
with great justice that I now call it a restless desire, 
for it was so : when I was at home, I was restless to 
go abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was restless to 
be at home. I say, what was this gain to me ? I 
was rich enough already; nor had I any uneasy 
desires about getting more money; and therefore, 
the profits of the voyage to me were things of no 
great force to me, for the prompting me forward to 
further undertakings ; hence I thought, that by this 
voyage I had made no progress at all; because I 
was come back, as I might call it, to the place from 
whence I came, as to a home; whereas my eye, 
which, like that which Solomon speaks of, was never 
satisfied with seeing, was still more desirous of 
wandering and seeing. I was come into a part 
of the world which I never was in before ; and that 
part in particular, which I had heard much of; and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 251 

Was resolved to see as much of it as I could; and 
then I thought I might say I had seen all the world 
that was worth seeii^. 

But my {ellow-traveller and I had different no- 
tions; I do not name this to insist upon my own, 
for I acknowledge bis was most just, and the most 
suited to the end of a merchant's life ; who, when he 
is abroad upon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick 
to that, as the best thing for him, which he is like to 
get the most money by. My new friend kept him- 
self to the nature of the thing, and would have been 
content to have gone, like a carrier's horse, always to 
the same inn, backward and forward, provided he 
could, as he called it, find his account in it ; on the 
other hand, mine, as old as I was» was the notion of 
a mad rambling boy that never cares to see a thing 
twice over. 

But this was not all ; I had a kind of impatience 
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un- 
settled resolution imaginable, which way to go. In 
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who 
was always upon the search for business, proposed 
another voyage to me, viz., among the Spice islands ; 
and to bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas, 
or thereabouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch do 
trade, but the islands belong partly to the Spaniards; 
though we went not so far, but to some other, where 
they have not the whole power, as they have at 
Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in prepar- 
ing for this voyage ; the chief difficulty was in bring- 
ing me to come into it ; however, at last, nothing else 



252 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

offering, and finding that really stirring about and 
trading, the profit being so great, and as I may say 
certain, had more pleasure in it, and more satisfac- 
tion to the mind, than sitting still; which, to me 
especially, was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved 
on this voyage too, which we made very successfuliyi 
touching at Borneo, and several islands, whose names 
I do not remember, and came home in about five 
months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves 
and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who 
carried them away for the Gulf, and, making near five 
of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled 
at me : " Well, now," said he, with a sort of an agree- 
able insult upon my indolent temper, "is not this 
better than walking about here, like a man of nothing 
to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense 
and ignorance of the Pagans ? " 

" Why, truly," said I, " my friend, I think it is ; and 
I begin to be a convert to the principles of merchan- 
dising. But I must tell you," said I, " by the way, 
you do not know what I am doing ; for if once I 
conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, as 
old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the 
world till I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, 
I shall never let you lie still." 

But to be short with my speculations : a little 
while after this there came in a Dutch ship from 
Batavia; she was a coaster, not a European trader, 
and of about two hundred tons burden : the men, as 
they pretended, having been so sickly, that the captaia 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 253 

had not men enough to go to sea with, he lay by at 
Bengal ; and, as if having got money enough, or being 
willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave 
public notice, that he would sell his ship : this came 
to my ears before my new partner heard of it ; and I 
had a great mind to buy it. So I went home to him, 
and told him of it ; he considered awhile, for he was 
no rash man neither; but musing some time, he 
replied, "She is a little too big; but, however, we 
will have her." Accordingly we bought the ship; 
and, agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and 
took possession ; when we had done so, we resolved 
to entertain the men, if we could, to join them with 
those we had, for the pursuing our business ; but on 
a sudden, they not having received their wages, but 
their .share of the money, as we afterwards learnt, not 
one of them was to be found. We inquired much 
about them, and at length were told, that they were 
all gone together, by land, to Agra, the great city of 
the Mogul's residence ; and from thence were to travel 
to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, 
as that I missed the opportunity of going with them : 
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company 
as would both have guarded me and diverted me, 
would have suited mightily with my great design ; 
and I should both have seen the world, and gone 
homewards too; but I was much better satisfied a 
few days after, when I came to know what sort of 
fellows they were; for, in short, their history was, 
that this man they called captain was the gunner

only, not the commander; that they had been a trad- 
ing voyage, in which they were attacked on shore by 
some of the Malaccans, who had killed the captain 
and three of his men ; and that after the captain was 
killed, these men, eleven in number, had resolved to 
run away with the ship, which they did; and had 
brought her in at the Bay of Bengal, leaving the mate 
and five men more on shore ; of whom we shall hear 
further. 

Well ; let them come by the ship how they would, 
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we 
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as 
we ought ; for we never inquired anything of the sea- 
men, who, if we had examined, would certainly have 
faltered in their accounts, contradicted one another, 
and perhaps have contradicted themselves; or, ooe 
how or other, we should have seen reason to have 
suspected them ; but the man showed us a bill of sale 
for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some 
such name (for I suppose it was all a forgery), and 
called himself by that name : and we could not con« 
tradict him ; and being withal a little too unwary, or 
at least having no suspicion of the thing, we went 
through with our bargain.

CHAPTER XI. 

MAKE A TRADING VOYAGE IN THIS SHIP — PUT INTO THE 
RIVER OF CAMBODIA — AM WARNED OF MY DANGER BY 
A COUNTRYMANy IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WE SET 
SAILy AND ARE PURSUED — GREAT DIFFICULTY IN 
MAKING OUR ESCAPE. 

However, we picked up some English seamen here 
after this, and some Dutch ; and we now resolved 
for a second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &c., 
that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca 
isles; and, in short, not to fill this part of my story 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remark- 
able, I spent, from first to last, six years in this coun- 
try, trading from port to port, backward and forward, 
and with very good success; and was now the last 
year with my partner, going in the ship above-men- 
tioned, on a voyage to China ; but designing first to 
go to Siam to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of 
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner 
got clear of those difRcult seas, but we found our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by 
all our industry, to find out where it was. This 



256 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

forced us to make for some port ; and my partner, 
who knew the country better than I did, directed 
the captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for 
I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, 
captain, not being willing to take the charge of the 
ship upon myself. This river lies on the north side 
of the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on shore for 
refreshment, there comes to me one day an English- 
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board 
an English East India ship, which rode in the same 
river, up at, or near, the city of Cambodia: what 
brought him hither we knew not ; but he comes up 
to me, and, speaking English — 

"Sir," says he, "you are a stranger to me, and I 
to you ; but I have something to tell you that very 
nearly concerns you." 

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and he 
thought at first I had known him, but I did not 

" If it very nearly concerns me," said I, " and not 
yourself, what moves you to tell it me .^*' 

" I am moved," says he, " by the imminent danger 
you are in ; and, for aught I see, you have no know- 
ledge of it." 

" I know no danger I am in," said I, " but that my 
ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out ; but I propose 
to lay her aground to-morrow to see if I can find 
it." 

" But, sir," says he, " leaky or not leaky, find it or 
not find it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on 
shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

to you. Do you know, sir," said he, "the town of 
Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? 
And there are two large English ships about five 
leagues on this side, and three Dutch." 

" Well," said I, " and what is that to me ? " 

" Why, sir," says he, " is it for a man that is upon 
such adventures as you are to come into a port, and 
not examine first what ships there are there, and 
whether he is able to deal with them ? I suppose 
you do not think you are a match for them ?" 

I was amused very much at his discourse, but not 
amazed at it; for I could not conceive what he 
meant ; and I turned short upon him and said — 

"Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot 
imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of 
the Company's ships, or Dutch ships ; I am no in- 
terloper ; what can they have to say to me ? " 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleased ; and 
pausing awhile, but smiling — 

** Well, sir," says he, " if you think yourself secure, 
you must take your chance; I am sorry your fate 
should blind you against good advice; but assure 
yourself if you do not put to sea immediately, you 
will the very next tide be attacked by five long- 
boats full of men ; and, perhaps, if you are taken, 
you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars 
be examined into afterwards. I thought, sir," added 
he, " I should have met with a better reception than 
this, for doing you a piece of service of such import- 
ance." 

"I can never be ungrateful," said I, "for any

" Nay, siif," says he, " dp not talk pjf bcvpg upon

your gusird \ the best defence is * to be out of the 
danger; if you have any regard .to your life, and the 
lives of all your men, put out to sea without fail at 
high*water; and as you have a whole tide before 
you, you will be gone too far out before they can 
come down; for they will come away at high- 
water ; and as they have twenty miles to come, 
you'll get near two hours of them by the difference 
of the tide, not reckoning the length of the way : 
besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they 
will not venture to follow you far out to sea, espe*^ 
cially if it blpws." 

" Well," said I, " you have been very kind in this : 
what shall I do for you to make you amends ? " 

"Sir," says he, "you naay not be so willing to 
make me amends, because you may not be con- 
vinced of the truth of it : I will make an offer to 
you ; I have nineteen months' pay due to me on 
board the ship ^ which \ came out of Eng- 

land in: and the Dutchman, that is with me, has 
sqveo moQths' pay due to him ; if you will make 
good our pay to us, we will go along with you : if 
you find nothing more in it, ve will desire no more ; 
but if we do convince you that we have saved your 
life and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, 
we will leave the rest to you," 

I consented to this readily ; and went immediately 
on board» and the two men with me. As soon as I 
came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on 
hoard, came on the quarter-deck, and called to me 
with a great deal of joy — 



26o THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

" O ho ! O ho ! we have stopped the leak ! ** 

^* Say you so ? " said I ; •* thank God ; but weigh 
the anchor then immediately." 

" Weigh ! " says he ; " what do you mean by that? 
What is the matter ? " says he. 

" Ask no questions/' said I, " but all hands to work, 
and weigh without losing a minute." 

He was surprised : but, however, he called the 
captain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to 
be got up; and though the tide was not quite done, 
yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea ; 
then I called him into the cabin and told him the 
story at large; and we called in the men, and they 
told us the rest of it : but as it took us up a great deal 
of time, so before we had done, a seaman comes to 
the cabin-door, and calls out to us, that the captain 
bade him tell us we were chased. 

" Chased ! " said I ; " by whom, and by what ? " 

" By five sloops, or boats," said the fellow, ** full of 
men." 

" Very well," said I ; " then it is apparent there is 
something in it." 

In the next place, I ordered all our men to be 
called up, and told them, that there was a design to 
seize the ship, and to take us for pirates ; and asked 
them, if they would stand by us and by one another? 
The men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they 
would live and die with us. Then I asked the cap- 
tain what way he thought best for us to manage a 
fight with them ; for resist them I resolved we would, 
and that to the last drop. He said, readily, that the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 261 

way was to keep them off with our great shot, as 
long as we could, and then to fire at them with our 
small arms, to keep them from boarding us ; but 
when neither of these would do any longer, we should 
retire to our close quarters, perhaps they had not 
materials to break open our bulk-heads, or get in 
upon us. 

The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to briog 
two guns, to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage to 
clear the deck, and load them with musket-bullets 
and small pieces of old iron, and what next came to 
hand; and thus we made ready for fight; but all 
this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and 
could see the boats at a distance, being five large 
long-boats following us, with all the sail they could 
make. 

Two of these boats, which by our glasses we could 
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near 
two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon us 
considerably ; so that we found they would come 
up with us : upon which we fired a gun without shot, 
to intimate that they should bring to ; and we put 
out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but they 
kept crowding after us, till they came within shot : 
upon this we took in our white flag, they having 
made no answer to it; hung out the red flag, and 
fired at them with shot : notwithstanding this, they 
came on till they were near enough to call to them 
with a speaking-trumpet, which he had on board ; so 
we called to them, and bade them keep off at their 
peril 



262 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

It was all one; they crowded after Us, and en- 
deavoured to come under our stern, so to board us 
on our quarter : upon which, seeing they were resolute 
for mischief, and depended upon the strength that 
followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that 
they lay upon our broadsidci when immediately we 
fired five guns at them ; one of them had been levelled 
sp true, as to carry away the stern of the hindermost 
boat, and bring them to the necessity of taking down 
their sail, and running all to the head of the boat to 
keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and had 
enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat still 
crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in 
particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, 
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re- 
lieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out 
the men : we called again to the foremost boat, and 
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what 
was her business with us ; but had no answer \ only 
she crowded close under our stem. Upon this our 
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run out 
his two chase^guns, and fired at her ; but the shot 
missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their 
caps, and came on ; but the gunner, getting quickly 
ready again^ fired among them a Second time ; one 
shot of which, though it missed the boat itself^ yet 
fell in among the men, and we coiuld easily see had 
done a great deal of mischief among them ; but we, 
taking no notice of that, weared the ship again, and

We could recbVet him. As soOrt as they Were on

^ THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

When we were now at sea, we began to consult 
with the two seamen, and inquire, first, what the 
meaning of all this should be ? The Dutchman let 
us into the secret of it at once ; telling us, that the 
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more 
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he 
told us how the captain, whose name too he men- 
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was 
treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast 
of Malacca, with three of his men ; and that he, this 
Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where 
they wandered about a great while ; till at length he, 
in particular, in a miraculous manner, made his escape, 
and swam off to a Dutch ship, which sailing near the 
shore, in its way from China, had sent their boat on 
shore for fresh water ; that he durst not come to that 
part of the shore where the boat was» but made shift 
in the night to take in the water further off, and 
swimming a great while, at last the ship's boat took 
him up. 

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where 
two of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived, 
having deserted the rest in their travels ; and gave an 
account, that the fellow who had run away with the 
ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which 
were gone a-cruising in her; and that they had 
already taken an English ship, and two Dutch ships, 
very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us directly ; 
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my partner 
said very well, if we had fallen into their hands, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 265 

they had such a prepossession against us beforehand^ 
it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves, 
or to hope for any good quarters at their hands ; 
especially considering that our accusers had been our 
judges, and that we could have expected nothing 
from them but what rage would have dictated, and 
ungoverned passion have executed ; and therefore it 
was his opinion, we should go directly back to Ben-, 
gal, from whence we came, without putting in at any 
port whatever; because there we could give an ac- 
count of ourselves, and could prove where we were 
when the ship put in, whom we bought her of, and 
the like ; and which was more than all the rest, if we 
were put to the necessity of bringing it before the 
proper judges, we should be sure to have some justice ; 
and not be hanged first, and judged afterwards. 

I was sometime of my partner's opinion ; but after 
a little more serious thinking, I told him, I thought 
it was a very great hazard for us to attempt returning 
to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the 
Straits of Malacca ; and that if the alarm was given, 
we should be sure to be waylaid on every side, as 
well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the English else- 
where ; that if we should be taken, as it were, running 
away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there 
would want no more evidence to destroy us. I also 
asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he was 
of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken. 

This danger a little startled my partner, aod all 
the ship's company ; and we immediately resolved to 
go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to China ;

away N.N.E., keeping above fifty leases Off frbm 
the usual course to the eastward. 

This, however, put us tb Some iriconveilience§ ; fbi- 
first the winds, When we came td that distance from 
the Shore, seemed tb be mbre steadily Against us, 
blowing almost tfade, aS we call it, from the E. sliid 
E*N.B.; so that we were a Ibng while Uport oUir 
voyage, and we Were but ill provided with victuals for 
so long a run ; and, whidh Was still Worse, there was 
some danger that those English and Dutch ships, 
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound 
that Wavi hiight be got in before us ; and if not, 
some other ship bound tb China might have infor- 
mation of us from them, and pursue us With the same 
vigour. 

I must cbhfeds I waS hbW Very uneasy, and thought 
myself, irtcluding the late escape from the long-boats, 
to have beeU iti the most dangerous condition that 
evei- I Wad in through all tny past life ; for Whatever 
ill circumstances I had been in, I Was hevei- pursued 
for a thief before ; rtor had I ever dbhe anything that 
merited the hame of diShohedt or fraud uleht, muth 
ledd thievish, I had chiefly beert mine Own enemy ; 
or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy 
but my own. But UbW I wiis embarrassed iii the 
worst conditioh imagiUable; fbr though I Wa^ per- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 267 

fectly ihtiocent, I wad iii no condttion to tnkke that 
innocence appear : and if I h^d been taken, it had 
been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind ; at 
least, a crime esteemed s<l among the people I had to 
do with. 

This made me very ttilxious to make an escape, 
though which way to do It I kneW not ; or what port 
or place we should go to. My partner, seeing me 
thus dejected, though he was the most concerned at 
first, began to encourage me ; and describing to me 
the several ports of that coast, told me, he would put 
in on the coast df Cochin China, 6r the Bay of Toti- 
quin ; intending to go afterwards to Macao, a town 
once in the possession of the Portuguese, and where 
still a great many European families resided, and 
particularly the missionary priests usually went 
thither, in order to their going forward to China. 

Hither we then resolved to go; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very 
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight 
of the coast very early in the morning ; and upon re- 
flection upon the past circumstances we were in, and 
the danger if we had not escaped, we resolved to put 
into a small river, which, however, had depth enough 
of water for us, and to see if we could, either overland 
or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships 
were in any port thereabouts. This happy step was, 
indeed, our deliverance; for though we did not im- 
mediately see any European ships in the Bay of Ton- 
quin, yet the next morning there came into the bay 
two Dutch ships; and a third without any colours

spread out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman^ 
passed by at about two leagues' distance, steering for 
the coast of China ; and in the afternoon went by 
two English ships, steering the same course ; and thus 
we thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both 
one way and the other. The place we were in was 
wild and barbarous, the people thieves, even by oc- 
cupation or profession ; and though, it is true, we had 
not much to seek of them, and except getting a few 
provisions, cared not how little we had to do with 
them ; yet it was with much difficulty that we kept 
ourselves from being insulted by them several ways.

^£ were in a small river of this country, within a 
''^w leagues of its utmost limits northward, and by 
^Ur boat we coasted north-east to the point of land 
^hich opens to the great Bay of Tonquin ; and it 
^as in this beating up along the shore that we dis- 
covered as above, that in a word, we were surrounded 
^ith enemies. The people we were among were the 
^ost barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast ; 
Having no correspondence with any other nation, and 
dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross com- 
ttiodities ; and it may be particularly seen that they 
^re, as I said, the most barbarous of any of the in- 
liabitants, viz., that among other customs they have 
'tilts one, that if any vessel had the misfortune to be 
shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently make 
'Uie men all prisoners — that is to say, slaves ; and it 
x^as not long before we found a spice of their kind- 
ness this way, on the occasion following : 

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a 



ayo THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

leak at sea, and that we could not find it out ; aod 
however it happened, that, as I have said, it was 
stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our 
beings to be seized by the Dutch and English ships, 
near the Bay of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the 
ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we 
resolved, while we were in this place, to lay her on 
shore, take out what heavy things we had on board, 
which were not many, and to wash and clean her 
bottom, and if possible to fiad oqt where the leaks 
were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought 
all our guns and other movable things to one side, 
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at 
her bottom ; for, on second thoughts, we did not care 
to lay her dry aground, neither could we find out a 
proper place for it 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with such a sight, came wonderii^ down to the shore 
to look at us ; and seeing the ship lie down on one 
side in such a manner, and heeling towards the shore, 
and not seeing our men, who were at work on her 
bottom with stages, and with their boats, on the off 
side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast 
away, and lay so very fast on the ground. 

On this supposition, they came all about us in two 
or three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats, 
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plunder the ship ; and if they had found us there, to 
have carried us away for slaves to their kii^, or

the outsider of the ahjp's bottoin and sjde, washing 
and graying, an4 stopping, as eve^ry ^^faring man 
knows how. 

Jhey stood for a while gazin|F at us, and yro^ who 
were a tittle surprised, could not imagine what their

for in le3s than a quarter of an hour's consultation, 
they agreed> it se^ms, that the abip was really a 
wreck ; that we were all at wprk endeavouring to 
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our 
boats ; and when we handed our arms into the boats, 
they cpncluded by that motion that we w<ere endea- 
voi^rmg to save sojnei 0/ our- goodsi Upon this, they 
took it (ox grantied they all belonged to them, and 
away they ^n^^ directly upon our men, as if it had

f^hted, for w^ lay but in an ill pos^ture to f^ht, 
and cried out to us to know what they should do ? 
I inimedia^ely called to the men who worked upon 
the stagey to slip theni down, and get up the side 
intq the shjp^ and bade thoae in the boat to row 
round and co^^e on bP^r^ and those few of us who 



272 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

were on board, worked with all the strength and 
hands we had, to bring the ship to rights ; but, how- 
ever, neither the men upon the stage, nor those in 
the boats, could do as they were ordered, before the 
Cochin Chinese were upon them, and with two of 
their boats, boarded our long-boat, and b^an to lay 
hold of the men as their prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold of was an Englbh 
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who, having a musket 
in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down 
in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he under- 
stood his business better than I could teach him ; 
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by 
main force out of their own boat into ours ; where, 
taking him by the two ears, he beat his head so 
against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died in- 
stantly in his hands ; and in the meantime, a Dutch- 
man, who stood next, took up the musket, and with 
the butt-end of it, so laid about him, that he knocked 
down five of them who attempted to enter the boat. 
But this was little towards resisting thirty or forty 
men, who, fearless, because ignorant of their danger, 
began to throw themselves into the long-boat, where 
we had but five men to defend it. But one accident 
gave our men a complete Victory, which deserved 
our laughter rather than anything else, and that was 
this : — 

Our carpenter, being prepared to grave the outside 
of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had 
caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles 
just let down into the boat ; one filled with boiling 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 273 

pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and 

such stuff as the shipwrights used for that work; 

and the man that tended the carpenter had a great 

iron ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the 

men that were at work with that hot stuff: two of the 

enemy's men entered the boat just where this fellow 

stood, being in the fore-sheets; he immediately 

saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, 

which so burned and scalded them, being half naked, 

that they roared out like two bulls, and, enraged with 

the fire, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter saw 

it, and cried out, " Well done, Jack, give them some 

more of it ;" when, stepping forward himself, he takes 

one of their mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he 

and his man threw it among them so plentifully that, 

in short, of all the men in three boats, there was not 

one that was not scalded and burnt with it in a most 

frightful, pitiful manner, and made such a howling 

and crying, that I never heard a worse noise, and, 

indeed, nothing like it ; for it was worth observing, 

that though pain naturally makes all people cry out, 

yet every nation have a particular way of exclamation, 

and make noises as different from one another as 

their speech. I cannot give the noise these creatures 

made a better name than howling, nor a name more 

proper to the tone of it ; for I never heard anything 

more like the noise of the wolves, which, as I have 

said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of 

Languedoc. 

I was never pleased with a victory better in my 

life ; not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and 
VOL. II. S 



174 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that our danger was {mmineflt before; but as we 
got this victory without any bloodshed, except of 
that man the fellow killed with h}s naked hands^ and 
which I was very much concerned at ; for I was sick 
of killing such poor savage wretches, even though 
it was in my own defence, knowing they came oa 
errands which they thought just, and knew no better; 
and that though it may be a just thing, because 
necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in 
nature), yet I thought it was a sad life, when we 
must be always obliged to be killing our fellow- 
creatures to preserve ourselves; and, indeed, I think 
so still ; and I would, even now, suffer a great deal, 
rather than I would take ^way the life even of tiie 
worst person injuring me. I believe also, all con- 
sidering people who know the value of life would be 
of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the con- 
sideration of it. 

But to return to my story. All the while this was 
doing, my partner and I, ^o managed the rest of 
the men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought 
the ship almost to rights ; and, having gotten the 
guns into their places again, the gunner called to me 
to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let 
fly among them. I called back again to him, and bid 
him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the 
work without him ; but bade him heat another pitch- 
kettle, which our cook, who was on board, took care 
of. But the enemy was so terrified with what they 
met with in their first attack, that they would not 
come on again ; and s6me of them that were furthest 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275 

off, seeing the ship swim» as it were, upright, began, 
as we supposed, to see their mistake, and gave over 
the enterprise, finding it was not as they expected, 
Thu3 we got clear of this merry fight; and having 
gotten some rice, and some roots and bread, with 
about sixteen good big hogs on board, two days 
before, we resolved to 3tay here no longer, but go 
forw?ird, whatever came gf it ; for we piade nq doubt 
but we should be surrounded the next day with 
rogues enough, perhaps more than pur pitch- kettle 
would dispose of for us. 

We therefore got all our things on board the same 
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. 
In the meantime, lying at an anchor some distance 
from the shore, we were not so much concerned, bein^f 
now in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing pos- 
ture, if any enemy had presented. The next day, 
having finished oyr work within board, and finding 
our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set 
sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, 
for we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be 
known concerning the Dutch ships that had been 
there ; but we durst not stand in there, because we 
had seen several ^hips go in^ ^s we supposed, but a 
little before ; so we kept on N.E. towards the isle of 
Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or 
English merchant-ship, as a Dutch or English mer- 
chant-ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algeri^e 
man-of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E. 
a$ if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine 



276 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

islands, and thus we did, that we might not fall into 
the way of any of the European ships ; and then 
we steered north again, till we came to the latitude 
of 22 degrees 20 minutes, by which means we made 
the island of Formosa directly, where we came to an 
anchor, in order to get water and fresh provisions, 
which the people there, who are very courteous and 
civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly, and 
dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their 
agreements and bargains, which is what we did not 
find among other people, and may be owing to the 
remains of Christianity, which was once planted here 
by a Dutch mission of Protestants, and is a testimony 
of what I have often observed, viz., that the Christian 
religion always civilises the people, and reforms their 
manners, where it is received, whether it works saving 
effects upon them or not 

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast 
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were 
beyond all the ports of China where our European 
ships usually come; but being resolved, if possible, 
not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this 
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could 
not fail of being entirely ruined : nay, so great was 
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them, 
that I believe firmly I would much rather have chosen 
to fall into the hands of the Spanish Inquisition. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 
resolved to put into the first trading port we should 
come at; and standing in for the shore, a boat came 
off two leagues to us, with an old Portugfuese pilot 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 277 

on board, who, knowing us to be a European ship, 
came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were very 
glad of, and took him on board ; upon which, with- 
out asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the 
boat he came in, and sent it back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to 
make the old man carry us whither we would, that I 
began to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulf 
of Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the 
coast of China. The old man said he knew the Gulf 
of Nanquin very well ; but smiling, asked us what we 
would do there ? 

I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase 
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, 
&c, and so would return by the same course we 
came. He told us our best port had been to have 
put in at Macao, where we could not fail of a market 
for our opium to our satisfaction, and might, for our 
money, have purchased all sorts of China goods as 
cheap as we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I 
told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, 
and that we had a mind to go and see the great city 
of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. 

** Why then," says the old man, " you should go to 
Ningpo, where, by the river that runs into the sea 
there, you may go up within five leagues of the great 
canal. This canal is a navigable made stream, which 
goes through the heart of all that vast empire of 



278 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

China, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable 
hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to 
the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred 
and seventy leagues." 

" Well," said I, " Seignior Portuguese, but that is 
not our business now ; the great question is, if you 
can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence 
we can travel to Pekin afterwards ? " 

Yes, he isaid, he could do so very well, and there 
was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. 
This gave me a little shock; a Dutch ship was now 
our terror, and we had much rather haVe met the 
devil, at least, if he had not come in too frightful a 
figure ; we depended upon it that a Dutch ship would 
be our destruction, for we were in no condition to 
fight them ; all the ships they trade with in those 
parts being of great burden, and of much greater 
force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under 
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and 
said to me — 

" Sir, you need be under no apprehension of the 
Dutch ; I suppose they are not How at war with your 
nation." 

"No," said I, ''that^s true; but I know not what 
liberties men may take when they are out of the reach 
of the laws of their country." 

"Why," said he, "you are no pirates, what need 
you fear.^ They will not meddle with peaceable 
merchants sure." 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 279 

into my face at that word» it was hindered by some 
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate 
it ; for it put me into the greatest disorder and 
confusion imaginable ; nor was it possible for me 
to conceal it so, but that the old man easily per- 
ceived it* 

" Sir," said he, " I find you are in some disorder 
in your thoughts at my talk ; pray be pleased to go 
which way you think fit, and depend upon it Til do 
you all the service I can/' 

" Why, Seignior," said I, " it is true I am a little 
unsettled in my resolution, at this time> whither to 
go in particular; and I am something more so for 
what you said about pirates. I hope there are no 
pirates in these seas; we are but in ill condition to 
meet with them; for you see we have but a small 
force, and but very weakly manned." 

" Oh, sir>" said he, " do not be concerned ; I do not 
know that there have been any pirates in these seas 
these fifteen years, except one which was seen, as I 
hear, in the Bay of Siam^ about a month since ; but 
you may be assured she is gone to the southward ; 
nor was she a ship of any great force^ or fit for the 
work : she was not built for a privateer, but was run 
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board, 
after the captain and some of his men had been 
murdered by the Malaccans, at or near the island of 
Sumatra/' 

" What ! " said I, seeming to know nothing pf the 
matter, "did they murder the captain?" 

" No," said he, " I do not understand that they 



28o THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

murdered him; but as they afterwards ran away 
with the ship, it is generally believed they be- 
trayed him into the hands of the Malaccans, who did 
murder him; and perhaps they procured them to 
do it." 

"Why, then," said I, "they deserved death as 
much as if they had done it themselves." 

" Nay," said the old man, " they do deserve it, and 
they will certainly have it if they light upon any 
English or Dutch ship; for they have ail agreed 
together, that if they meet that rogue, they will give 
him no quarter." 

" But," said I to him, ** you say the pirate is gone 
out of these seas ; how can they meet with him 
then?" 

"Why, that is true," said he, "they do say so; 
but he was, as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the 
river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some 
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were 
left on shore when they ran away with her; and 
some English and Dutch traders being in the river, 
they were within a little of taking him. Nay," said 
he, " if the foremost boats had been well seconded by 
the rest, they had certainly taken him ; but he find- 
ing only two boats within reach of him, tacked about, 
and fired at these two, and disabled them before the 
others came up ; and then standing ofT to sea, the 
others were not able to follow him, and so he got 
away. But they have all so exact a description of 
the ship, that they will be sure to know him ; and 
wherever they find him, they have vowed to give no 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 281 

quarter to either the captain or the seamen, but to 
hang them all up at the yard-arm." 

" What ! " said I, " will they execute them, right or 
wrong? hang them first, and judge them after- 
wards ? " 

" Oh, sir ! " said the old pilot, ** there is no need to 
make a formal business of it with such rogues as 
those ; let them tie them back to back, and set them 
a-diving; it is no more than they rightly deserve." 

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that 
he could do me no harm; so I turned short upon 
him. 

** Well, Seignior," said I, " and this is the very reason 
why I would have you carry us to Nanquin, and not 
to put back to Macao, or to any other part of the 
country where the English or Dutch ships come ; for 
be it known to you. Seignior, those captains of the 
English and Dutch ships arc a parcel of rash, proud, 
insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to 
justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of 
God and nature direct; but being proud of their 
offices, and not understanding their power, they 
would act the murderers to punish robbers; would 
take upon them to insult men falsely accused, and 
determine them guilty without due inquiry; and 
perhaps I may live to call some of them to an account 
of it, where they may be taught how justice is to be 
executed ; and that no man ought to be treated as a 
criminal till some evidence may be had of the crime, 
and that he is the man." 

With this I told him that this was the very ship 



( 



282 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

they had attacked ; ^nd gave him a full account of 
the skirmish we had with their boats^ and how 
foolishly and coward-like they had behaved). I told 
him all the story of our buying the ship, and how 
the Dutchman served us. I told him the reasons I 
had to believe that this story of killing the master 
by the Malaccans was not true ; as also the running 
away with the ship ; but that it was all a fiction of 
their own, to suggest that the men were turned 
pirates ; and they ought to have been sure it was so, 
before they had ventured to attack us by surprise, 
and oblige us to resist them ; adding, that they would 
have the blood of those men who were killed there, 
in our just defence, to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation; and 
told us, we were very much in the right to go away 
to the north; and that if 1^ might advise us, it 
should be to sell the ship in China, which we might 
very well do, and buy or build another in the 
country. " And," said he, " though you will not get 
so good a ship, yet you may get one able enough to 
carry you and all your goods back again to Bengal, 
or anywhere else." 

I told him I would take his advice when I came 
to any port where I could find a ship for my turn, 
or get any customer to buy this. He replied, I 
should meet with customers enough for the ship at 
Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me 
very well to go back again; and that he would 
procure me people both to buy otie and sell the 
othen 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 283 

" Well, but, Seignior," says I, " as you say they 
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow 
your measures, be instrumental to bring some honest, 
innocent men into a terrible broil, and pertiaps be 
murdered in cold blood ; for wherever they find the 
ship, they will prove the guilt upon the men, by 
proving this was the ship, and so innocent men may 
probably be overpowered and murdered." 

" Why," said the old man, " I'll find out a way to 
prevent that also ; for as I know all those commanders 
you speak of very well, and shall see them all as 
they pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in 
the thing, and let them know that they had been so 
much in the wrong; that though the people who 
were on board at first might run away with the ship, 
yet it was not true that they had turned pirates ; and 
that in particular those were not the men that first 
went off with the ship, but innocently bought her for 
their trade ; and I am persuaded they will so far be- 
lieve me, as, at least, to act more cautiously for the 
time to come." 

"Well," said I, **and will you deliver one message 
to them from me ? " 

"Yes, I will," says he, "if you will give it under 
you hand in writing, that I may be able to prove it 
came from you, and not out of my own head." 

I answered that I would readily give it him under 
my hand. So I took a pen and ink and paper, and 
wrote at lai^e the story of assaulting me with the 
long-boats, &c., the pretended reason of it, and the 
unjust) cruel design of it; and concluded to the com*- 



284 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

manders that they had done what they not only 
should have been ashamed of, but also, that if ever 
they came to England, and I lived to see them there, 
they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my 
country were not grown out of use before I arrived 
there. 

My old pilot read this over and over s^ain, and 
asked me several times if I would stand to it I 
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had any- 
thing left in the world ; being sensible that I should, 
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it home 
to them. But we had no occasion ever to let the 
pilot carry this letter, for he never went back again. 
While those things were passing between us, by way 
of discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin, 
and, in about thirteen daysi* sail, came to anchor at 
the south-west point of the great Gulf of Nanquin; 
where, by the way, I came by accident to understand 
that the two Dutch ships were gone that length 
before me, and that I should certainly fall into 
their hands. I consulted my partner again in this 
exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and 
would very gladly have been safe on shore almost 
anywhere. However, I was not in such perplexity 
neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no 
creek or harbour, which I might put into, and pursue 
my business with the Chinese privately, and be in 
no danger of the enemy. He told me, if I would sail 
to the southward about two-and-forty leagues, there 
was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers 
of the mission usually landed from Macao, on their 



OF ROBIWSON CRTJSOE. 28s 

progress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, 
and where no European ships ever put in : and, if I 
thought proper to put in there, I might consider 
what further course to take when I was on shore. 
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for mer- 
chants, except that at some certain times they had a 
kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan 
came over thither to buy the Chinese merchandises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place : the name 
of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell 
wrong, for I do not particularly remember it, having 
lost this, together with the names of many other 
places set down in a little pocket-book, which was 
spoiled by the water, on an accident which I shall 
relate in its order; but this I remember, that the 
Chinese or Japanese merchants we correspond witli, 
call it by a different name from that which our 
Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above, 
Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to 
this place, we weighed the next day, having only 
gone twice on shore, where we were to get fresh 
water; on both which occasions the people of the 
country were very civil to us, and brought us abund- 
ance of things to sell to us ; I mean of provisions, 
plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls ; but nothing 
without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being con- 
trary) not till five days ; but it was very much to our 
satisfaction, and I was joyful, and I may say, thank- 
ful, when I set my foot safe on shore, resolving, and 



86 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

my partner too^ that if it was possible to dispose of 
ourselves and effects any other way, though not 
every way to our satisfaction, we would never set 
one foot on board that unhappy vessel ^^in: and 
indeed I must acknowledge, that of all the circum- 
stances of life that ever I had any experience of, 
nothing makes mankind so completely miserable 
as that of being in constant fear. Well does the 
Scripture say, ''The fear of man brings a snare;'' 
it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely 
suppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief; 
the animal spirits sink, and all the vigour of nature, 
which usually supports men under other afflictions, 
and is present to them in the g^reatest exigencies, 
fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the 
fancy, by heightening every danger; representing the 
English and Dutch captains to be men incapable 
of hearing reason, or distinguishing between honest 
men and rogues ; or between a story calculated for 
our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to 
deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole 
voyage, prepress, and design; for we might many 
ways have convinced any reasonable creature that 
we were not pirates; the goods we had on board, 
the course we steered, our frankly showing our- 
selves, and entering into such and such ports; even 
our very manner, the force we had, the number of 
men, the few arms, little ammunition, and short pro- 
visions ; all these would have served to convince any 
man that we were no pirates. The opium, and other 



OF ROBJNSQK CRUSOE. 287 

goods we bad on board, would make it appear the 
ship had been at Bengal ; the Dutchmen, who, it was 
said, had the names of all the men that were in the 
ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of 
English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two 
Dutchmen on board. These, and many other parti- 
cular circumstances, might have made it evident to 
the understanding of any commander, whose hands 
we might fall into, that we were no pirates. 

But fear, that blind useless passion, worked another 
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our 
understandings, and set the imagination at work, to 
form a thousand terrible things that perhaps might 
never happen. We first supposed, as indeed every- 
body had related to us, that the seamen on board 
the English and Dutch ships, but especially the 
Dutch, were so enraged at the name of a pirate, 
and especially at our beating off their boats and 
escaping, that they would not give themselves leave 
to inquire whether we were pirates or no ; but would 
execute us off-hand, as we call it, without giving us 
any room for a defence. We reflected that there was 
really so much apparent evidence before them that 
they would scarce inquire after any more : as, first, that 
the ship was certainly the same, and that some of the 
seamen among them knew her, and had been on board 
her; and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at 
the river Cambodia that they were coming down to 
examine us, we fought their boats and fled; so that 
we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of 
our being pirates, as we were satisfied of the con- 



288 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

trary; and I often said, I knew not but I should 
have been apt to have taken the like circumstances 
for evidence, if the tables were turned, and my case 
was theirs; and have made no scruple of cutting 
all the crew to pieces, without believing, or perhaps 
considering what they might have to offer in their 
defence. 

But let that be how it will, those were our appre- 
hensions ; and both my partner and I, too, scarce 
slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard- 
arms — that is to say, gibbets ; of fighting, and being 
taken ; of killing and being killed ; and one night 
I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying the 
Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking one 
of their seamen down, that I struck my double fist 
against the side of the cabin I lay in, with such a 
force as wounded my hand most grievously, broke 
my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so 
that it not only waked me out of my sleep, but 
I was once afraid I should have lost two of my 
fingers. 

Another apprehension I had was, of the cruel usage 
we should meet with from them if we fell into their 
hands ; then the story of Amboyna came into my 
head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, 
as they did our countrymen there ; and make some 
of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those 
crimes they never were guilty of; own themselves, 
and all of us, to be pirates ; and so they would put 
us to death, with a formal appearance of justice ; and 
that they might be tempted to do this for the gain 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 289 

of our ship and cai^o, which was worth four or five 
thousand pounds, put all together. 

These things tormented me, and my partner too, 
night and day ; nor did we consider that the captains 
of ships have no authority to act thus ; and if we had 
surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer 
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be 
accountable for it when they came into their own 
country. This, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for 
if they will act thus with us, what advantage would 
it be to us, that they would be called to an account 
for it ? or, if we were first to be murdered, what satis- 
faction would it be to us to have them punished when 
they came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections 
I now had upon the past variety of my particular 
circumstances ; how hard I thought it was, that I, 
who had spent forty years in a life of continued 
difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, at the 
port or haven which all men drive at, viz., to have 
rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows 
by my own unhappy choice ; and that I, who had 
escaped so many dangers in my youth, should now 
come to be hanged in my old age, and in so remote 
a place, for a crime I was not in the least inclined to, 
much less guilty of; and in a place and circumstance, 
where innocence was not like to be any protection at 
all to me. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would 

come in ; and I would be considering that this seemed 

to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence ; 
VOL. II. T 



290 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and I ought to look upon it, and submit to it as 
such : that although I was innocent as to men, I was 
far from being innocent as to my Maker ; and I ought 
to look in, and examine what other crimes in my life 
were most obvious to me, and for which Providence 
might justly inflict this puni^ment as a retribution; 
and that I ought to submit to this, just as I would to 
a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to have brought 
such a disaster upon' me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take 
its place ; and then I would be talking myself up to 
vigorous resolution, that I would not be taken to be 
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches, 
in cold blood ; that it was much better to have fallen 
into the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters, 
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me, when they 
had taken me, than by those who would perhaps glut 
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and bar- 
barities : that in the case of the savages^ I always 
resolved to die fighting to the last gasp ; and why 
should I not do so now, seeing it was much more 
dreadful, to me at least, to think of falling into these 
men's hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten 
by men ; for the savages, give them their due, would 
not eat a man till he was dead ; and killed him first, 
as we do a bullock ; but that these men had many 
arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever these 
thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a 
kind of fever, with the agitations of a supposed fight; 
my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I 
was engaged ; and I always resolved that I would 



OF ROB lA SON CRUSOE. 291 

take no quarter at their hands ; but even at last, if 
I could resist no longer, I would blow up the sliip, 
and all that was in her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

But by how much the greater weight the anxieties 
and perplexities of those things were to our thoughts 
while we were at sea, by so much the greater was our 
satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore ; and my 
partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy 
load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, 
and found that he was not able to stand long under 
it ; but the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off his 
back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before 
him showing all smooth and plain ; and truly it was 
so ; we were all like men who had a load taken off 
their backs. 



292 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



CHAPTER XIII. 

WR ARRIVE IN CHINA IN SAFETY — DISPOSE OF THE SHIP 
— DESCRIPTION OF THE INHABITANTS — ARRIVR AT 
PEKIN^ AND FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF RETURNIKG 
TO EUROPE. 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my 
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear ; and, 
as I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in 
that ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot, 
who was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a 
warehouse for our goods, which by the way, was 
much the same : it was a little house or hut, with 
a large house adjoining to it, all built with canes, 
and palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out 
pilfering thieves, of which it seems there were not 
a few in the country. However, the magistrates 
allowed us all a little guard, and we had a soldier 
with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, who stood sen- 
tinel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice, 
and a little piece of money, about the value of three- 
pence, per day: so that our goods were kept very 
safe. 

The fair or mart usually kept in this place had 
been over some time ; however, we found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two Ja- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 293 

panners, I mean ships from Japan, with goods whicli 
they had bought in China, and were not gone away, 
having Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for 
us was to bring us acquainted with three missionary 
Romish priests, who were in the town, and who had 
been there some time converting the people to 
Christianity; but we thought they made but poor 
work of it, and made th^m but sorry Christians when 
they had done. However, that was not our business. 
One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called 
Father Simon; he was a jolly, well-conditioned man, 
very free in his conversation, not seeming so serious 
and grave as the other two did, one of whom was a 
Portuguese, and the other a Genoese ; but Father 
Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very 
agreeable company ; the other two were more re- 
served, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seri- 
ously to the work they came about, viz., to talk with, 
and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants 
wherever they had opportunity. We often ate and 
drank with those men; and though I must confess^ 
the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to 
Christianity, is so far from the true conversion re- 
quired to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, 
that it seems to amount to little more than letting 
them know the name of Christ, say some prayers to 
the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they 
understand not, and to cross themselves, and the like; 
yet it must be confessed that these religious, whom 
we call missionaries, have a firm belief that these 



294 THE LIFE AHD ADVENTURES 

people should be saved, and that they are the instru- 
meat of it ; and, oti this account they undergo not 
only the fatigue of the voyage and hazards of living 
in such places, but oftentimes death itself, with the 
mo^^t violent tortures, for the sake of this work : and 
it would be a great want of charity in us, whatever 
opinion we have of the work itself, and the manner 
of their doing it, if we should not have a good opinion 
of their zeal, who undertake it with so many hazards, 
and who have no prospect of the least temporal ad- 
vantage to themselves. 

But to return to my story: this French priest, 
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of 
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal 
seat of the Chinese emperor; and waited only for 
another priest, who was ordered to come to him from 
Macao, to go along with him; and we scarce ever 
met together but he was inviting me to go that 
journey with him, telling me how he would show me 
all the glorious things of that mighty empire ; and 
among the rest, the greatest city in the world. **A 
city," said he, " that your London and our Paris put 
together cannot be equal to." This was the city of 
Pekin, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely 
full of people; but as I looked on those things with 
different ty^s from other men, so I shall give my 
opinion of them in few words, when I come, in the 
course of my travels, to speak more particularly of 
them. 

But first I come to my friar or missionary ; dining 
with him one day, and being very merry together, I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29s 

showed some little inclination to go with him ; and 
he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a 
great many persuasions, to consent. 

"Why, Father Simon," says my partner, "why 
should you desire our company so much? You 
know we are heretics, and you do not love us, nor 
can keep us company with any pleasure." 

"Ohl" says he, "you may, perhaps, be good 
Catholics in time ; my business here is to convert 
heathens, and who knows but I may convert you 
too?" 

" Very well. Father," said I, " so you will preach to 
us all the way," 

"I won't be troublesome to you," said he; "our 
religion does not divest us of crood manners ; besides," 
said he, "we are all here like countrymen; and so 
we are, compared to the place we are in ; and if you 
are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may be all 
Christians at last : at least," said he, " we are all 
gentlemen, and we may converse so without being 
uneasy to one another." 

I liked that part of his discourse very well, and it 
began to put me in mind of my priest that I had 
left in the Brazils ; but this Father Simon did not 
come up to his character by a great deal ; for though 
Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal levity 
in him neither, yet he had not that fund of Christian 
zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection to religion, that 
my other good ecclesiastic had, of whom I have said 
so much. 

But to leave him a little, though be never left us. 



296 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had some- 
thing else before us at that time; for we had all 
this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose 
of; and we began to be very doubtful what we 
should do, for we were now in a place of very little 
business; and once I was about to venture to sail 
for the river of Kilam and the city of Nanquin : but 
Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought, 
than ever, to concern itself in our affairs ; and I was 
encouraged from this very time to think I should, 
one way or other, get out of this entangled 'circum- 
stance, and be brought home to my own country 
again, though I had not the least view of the manner; 
and when I began sometimes to think of it, could 
not imagine by what method it was to be done. 
Providence, I say, began here to clear up our way 
a little ; and the first thing that offered was, that 
our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant 
to us, who began to inquire what goods we had; 
and, in the first place, he bought all our opium, and 
gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold by 
weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and 
some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces 
each. While we were dealing with him for our opium, 
it came into my head that he might, perhaps, deal with 
us for the ship too ; and I ordered the interpreter to 
propose it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it 
when it was first proposed to him ; but in a few days 
after he came to me, with one of the missionary 
priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a 
proposal to make to me, and that was this ; he had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 297 

bought a great quantity of goods of us when he had 
no thoughts (or proposals made to him) of buying 
the ship, and that, therefore, he had not money 
enough to pay for the ship ; but if I would let the 
same men who were in the ship navigate her, he 
would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would send 
them from thence to the Philippine islands with 
another loading, which he would pay the freight of 
before they went from Japan ; and that, at their 
return, he would buy the ship. I began to listen to 
his proposal; and so eager did my head still run 
upon rambling, that I could not but begin to enter- 
tain a notion myself of going with him, and so to 
sail from the Philippine islands away to the South 
Seas; and accordingly I asked the Japanese mer- 
chant if he would not hire us to the Philippine islands, 
and discharge us there. He said, no, he could not 
do that ; for then he could not have the return of his 
cargo ; but he would discharge us in Japan, he said, 
at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him 
at that proposal, and going myself : but my partner, 
wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing 
the dangers, as well of the seas, as of the Japanese, 
who are a false, cruel, treacherous people : and then 
of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, more 
cruel, more treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a 
conclusion, the first thing we had to do was to con- 
sult with the captain of the ship and with the men, 
and know if they were willing to go to Japan ; and 
while I was doing this, the young man whom, as I 



298 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

said, my nephew had left with me as my companion 
for my travels, came to me and told me that he 
thought that voyage promised very fair, and that 
there was a great prospect of advantage, and he 
would be very glad if I undertook it ; but that if I 
would not, and would give him leave, he would go 
as a merchant, or how I pleased to order him ; and 
if ever he came to England, and I was there, and 
alive, he would render me a faithful account of his 
success, and it should be as much mine as I pleased. 

I was really loath to part with him ; but considering 
the prospect of advantage, which was really consider- 
able, and that he was a young fellow, as likely to do 
well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; 
but first I told him, I would consult my partner, and 
give him an answer the next day. My partner and 
I discoursed about it, and my partner made a most 
generous offer : he told me, *' You know it has been 
an unlucky ship, and we both resolved not to go to 
sea in it again ; if your steward (so he called my 
man) will venture the voyage, I'll leave my share of 
the vessel to him, and let him make the best of it ; 
and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with 
success abroad, he shall account for one half of the 
profits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be 
his own." 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with 
my young man, made him such an offer, I could do 
no less than offer him the same ; and all the ship's 
company being willing to go with him, we made over 
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 299 

from him, obliging him to account for the other; and 
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved 
a very punctual honest man to him, protected him at 
Japan, and got him a license to come on shore, which 
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained, 
paid him his freight very punctually, sent him to the 
Philippines, loaded him with Japan and China wares, 
and a supercargo of their own, who, trafficking with 
the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, 
and a great quantity of cloves and other spice ; and 
there he was not only paid his freight very well, and 
at a very good price, but being not willing to sell the 
ship then, the merchant furnished him with goods on 
his own account ; that for some money and some 
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he 
went back to the Manillas, to the Spaniards, where 
he sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a 
good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made 
a free ship ; and the governor of Manilla hired him 
to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast of 
Mexico ; and gave him a license to land there, and 
travel to Mexico ; and to pass in any Spanish ship 
to Europe, with all his men. 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, 
and there he sold his ship ; and having there also 
obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, 
he found means, some how or other, to go to Jamaica 
with all his treasure; and about eight years after 
came to England, exceeding rich ; of which I shall 
take notice in its place; in the meantime, I return 
to our particular affairs. 



300 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's com- 
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what 
recompense we should give to the two men that gave 
us such timely notice of the design against us in the 
river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us 
a considerable service, and deserved well at our 
hands ; though, by the way, they were a couple of 
rogues too: for, as they believed the story of our 
being pirates, and that we had really run away with 
the ship, they came down to us, not only to betray 
the design that was formed against us, but to go to 
sea with us as pirates; and one of them confessed 
afterwards, that nothing else but the hopes of going 
a-roguing brought him to do it. However, the 
service they did us was not the less ; and therefore, 
as I had promised to be grateful to them, I first 
ordered the money to be paid to them which they 
said was due to them on board their respective ships, 
that is to say, the Englishman nineteen months' pay 
and to the Dutchman seven ; and, over and above 
that, I gave each of them a small sum of money in 
gold, which contented them very well : then I made 
the Englishman gunner of the ship, the gunner being 
now made second mate and purser ; the Dutchman I 
made boatswain : so they were both very well pleased, 
and proved very serviceable, being both able seamen, 
and very stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China. If I thought 
myself banished, and remote from my own country 
at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for 
my money, what could I think of myself now, when 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 301 

I was gotten about a thousand leagues farther ofT 
from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of 
prospect of return I 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
months* time there was to be another fair at that 
place where we were, and then we might be able to 
purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the country, 
and withal might possibly find some Chinese junks 
or vessels from Nanquin, that would be to be sold, 
and would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. 
This I liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, 
as our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if 
any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we 
might have an opportunity to load our goods, and get 
passage to some other place in India nearer home. 

Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; 
but to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys 
into the country; first we went ten days' journey to 
see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing in- 
deed : they say it has a million of people in it ; which, 
however, I do not believe: it is regularly built, the 
streets all exactly straight, and cross one another in 
direct lines, which gives the figure of it great ad- 
vantage. 

But when I came to compare the miserable people 
of these countries with ours; their fabrics, their 
manner of living, their government, their religion, 
their wealth, and their glory (as some call it), I must 
confess I do not so much as think it worth naming, 
or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come 
after me to read. 



302 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

It is very observable that we wonder at the 
grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the 
g^overnment, the manufactures, the commerce, and 
the conduct of these people ; not that they are to be 
wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded ; 
but because, having first a notion of the barbarity of 
those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that 
prevail there, we do not expect to find any such 
things so far oflT. 

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces 
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade 
to the universal commerce of England, Holland, 
France, and Spain? What their cities to ours, for 
wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, 
and an infinite variety? What are their ports, sup- 
plied with a few junks and barks, to our navigation, 
our merchants' fleets, our large and powerful navies ? 
Our city of London has more trade than all their 
mighty empire. One English, or Dutch, or French 
man-of-war of eighty guns would fight with and 
destroy all the shipping of China. But the great- 
ness of their wealth, their trade, the power of their 
government, and strength of their armies, are surpris- 
ing to us, because, as I have said, considering them 
as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better than 
savages, we did not expect such things among them ; 
and this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their 
greatness and power is represented to us : otherwise, 
it is in itself nothing at all ; for as I have said of their 
ships, so it may be said of their armies and troops; 
all the forces of their empire, though they were to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

brings two millions of men intb the field together, would 

be able to do nodiing but ruin the country and starve 

themselves. If they were to besiege a strong town 

in Flanders, or to fight a disciplined army, one line 

of German cuirassiers^ or of French cavalry, would 

overthrow all the horse of China; a million of their 

foot could not stand before one embattled body of 

our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, 

though they were not to be one to twenty in 

number : nay, I do not boast, if I say that 30,000 

German or English foot, and io,coo French horse, 

would fairly beat all the forces of China. And so of 

our fortified towns, and of the art of our engineers, 

in assaulting and defending towns; there is not a 

fortified town in China could hold out one month 

against the batteries and attacks of an European 

army ; and at the same time, all the armies of China 

could never take such a town as Dunkirk, provided 

it was not starved ; no, not in ten years' siege. They 

have firearms, it is true, but they are awkward, 

clomsy, and uncertain in going off: they have 

powder, but it is of no strength : they have neither 

discipline in the field, exercise in their arms, skill to 

attack, nor temper to retreat And therefore I must 

confess it seemed strange to me when I came home, 

and heard our people say such fine thii^s of the 

power, riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of the 

Chinese, becatise I saw and knew that they were a 

contemptible herd or crowd of ig^norant, sordid slaves, 

subjected to a government qualified oiriy to rule such 

a people ; Mid, in a word, for I am now l^unohed 



304 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

quite beside my design, I say, in a word, were not its 
distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and were 
not the Muscovite empire almost as rude, impotent, 
and ill-governed a crowd of slaves as they, the Czar 
of Muscovy might, with much ease, drive them all 
out of their country, and conquer them in one cam- 
paign ; and had the Czar, who I since hear is a grow- 
ing prince, and begins to appear formidable in the 
world, fallen this way, instead of attacking the war- 
like Swedes, in which attempt none of the powers of 
Europe would have envied or interrupted him ; he 
might, by this time, have been emperor of China, 
instead of being beaten by the king of Sweden at 
Narva, when the latter was not one to six in number. 
As their strength and their grandeur, so their naviga- 
tion, commerce, and husbandry, are imperfect and 
impotent, compared to the same things in Europe. 
Also, in their knowledge, their learning, their skill in 
the sciences ; they have globes and spheres, and a 
smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics ; but when 
you come to inquire into their knowledge, how short- 
sighted are the wisest of their students ! They know 
nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies ; and 
so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when the sun is 
eclipsed, they think it is a great dragon has assaulted 
and run away with it ; and they fall a-clattering with 
all the drums and kettles in the country to fright the 
monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees. 
As this is the only excursion of this kind which I 
have made in all the account I have given of my 
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

countries and people : it is none of my business, or 
any part of my design ; but giving an account of my 
own adventures, through a life of infinite wander- 
ings, and a long variety of changes, which perhaps 
few have heard the like of, I shall say nothing of 
the mighty places, desert countries, and numerous 
people I have yet to pass through, more than relates 
to my own story, and which my concern among 
them will make necessary. I was now, as near as I 
can compute, in the heart of China, about the latitude 
of thirty degrees north of the line, for we were re- 
turned from Nanquin ; I had indeed a mind to see 
the city of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, 
and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it. 
At length his time of going away being set, and 
the other missionary who was to go with him being 
arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we should 
resolve either to go, or not to go ; so I referred him 
to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice ; who 
at length resolved it in the affirmative, and we pre- 
pared for our journey. We set out with very good 
advantage, as to finding the way ; for we got leave 
to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, a 
kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate, in the pro- 
vince where they reside, and who take great state 
upon them, travelling with great attendance, and 
with great homage from the people, who are some- 
times greatly impoverished by them, because all the 
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish 
provisions for them, and all their attendants. That 

which I particularly observed, as to our travelling 
VOL. II. "U 



3o6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

with his baggage, was this ; that though we received 
sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses, 
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet 
we were obliged to pay for everything we had after 
the market-price of the country, and the mandarin's 
steward, or commissary of the provisions, collected it 
duly from us; so that our travelling in the retinue of 
the mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to 
us, was not such a mighty favour in him, but was, 
indeed, a great advantage to him, considering there 
were about thirty other people travelling in the same 
manner besides us, under the protection of his re- 
tinue, or as we may call it, under his convoy. This, 
I say, was a great advantage to him ; for the country 
furnished all the provisions for nothing, and he took 
all our money for them. 

We were five-and-twenty days travelling to Pekin, 
through a country infinitely populous, but miserably 
cultivated ; the husbandry, economy, and the way 
of living, all very miserable, though they boast so 
much of the industry of the people : I say miserable— 
and so it is — if we, who understand how to live, were 
to endure it, or to compare it with our own ; but not 
so to these poor wretches, who know no other. The 
pride of these people is infinitely great, and exceeded 
by nothing but their poverty, which adds to that 
which I call their misery. I must needs think the 
naked savages of America live much more happy, 
because, as they have nothing, so they desire nothing ; 
whereas these are proud and insolent, and in the 
main are mere beggars and drudges; their osten* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 307 

tation is inexpressible, and is chiefly showed in their 
clothes and buildings, and in the keeping multitudes 
of servants or slaves, and which is to the last degree 
ridiculous, their contempt of all the world but them- 
selves. 

I must confess I travelled more pleasantly after- 
wards, in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand 
Tartary, than here : and yet the roads here are well 
paved and well kept, and very convenient for tra- 
vellers ; but nothing was more awkward to me than 
to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, 
in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance ; 
for all their famed ingenuity is no more. My friend 
Father Simon, and I, used to be very merry upon 
these occasions, to see the beggarly pride of those 
people. For example, coming by the house of a 
country-gentleman, as Father Simon called him, 
about ten leagues off from the city of Nanquin, we 
had, first of all, the honour to ride with the master 
of the house about two miles ; the state he rode in 
was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of 
pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper 
for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew ; being a dirty 
calico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's 
coat, such as hanging sleeves, taffeta, and cuts and 
slashes almost on every side; it covered a rich 
taffeta vest, as greasy as a butcher, and which tes- 
tified that his honour must needs be a most exquisite 
sloven. 

His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling 



3o8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

creature, such as in England might sell for about 
thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves fol- 
lowed him on foot, to drive the poor creature along ; 
he had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the 
beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about 
the tail ; and thus he rode by us with about ten or 
twelve servants: and we were told he was going 
from the city to his country-seat, about half a league 
before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure 
of a gentleman rode away before us; and as we 
stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us, 
when we came by the country-seat of this great 
man, we saw him in a little place before his door, 
eating his repast ; it was a kind of a garden, but he 
was easy to be seen ; and we were given to under- 
stand that the more we looked on him the better he 
would be pleased. 

He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto- 
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head, and 
on the south side; but under the tree also was placed 
a large umbrella, which made that part look well 
enough : he sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, 
being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being 
brought him by two women-slaves : he had two more 
whose office, I think, few gentlemen in Europe would 
accept of their service in, viz., one fed the squire with 
a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand, 
and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's 
beard and taffeta vest, with the other ; while the 
great fat brute thought it below him to employ his 
own hands in any of these familiar offices^ which 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 309 

kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled 
with the clumsy fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pain men's pride 
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty tem- 
per, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of common 
sense; and leaving the poor wretch to please him- 
self with our looking at him, as if we admired his 
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him, 
we pursued our journey : only Father Simon had the 
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the 
country justice had to feed on, in all his state ; which 
he said he had the honour to taste of, and which was, 
I think, a dose that an English hound would scarce 
have eaten, if it had been offered him, viz., a mess of 
boiled rice, with a great piece of garlick in it, and a 
little bag filled with green pepper, and another plant 
which they have there, something like our ginger, 
but smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard : 
all this is put together, and a small lump or piece of 
lean mutton boiled in it ; and this was his worship's 
repast, four or five servants more attending at a dis- 
tance. If he fed them meaner than he was fed 
himself, the spice excepted, they must fare very 
coarsely indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was respected like a king; surrounded always with 
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a 
distance ; but this I observed, that there was not a 
horse in his retinue, but that our carriers' pack* 
horses in England seem to me to look much better ; 



3IO THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

but they were so covered with equipage, mantles, 
trappings, and such-like trumpery, that you cannot 
see whether they are fat or lean. In a word, we 
could scarce see anything but their feet and their 
heads. 

I was now h'ght-hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I had given an account of being over, 
I had no anxious thoughts about me; which made 
this journey much the pleasanter to me: nor had I 
any ill accident attended me, only in the passing or 
fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me free 
of the country, as they call it : that is to say, threw 
me in : the place was not deep, but it wetted me all 
over : I mention it, because it spoiled my pocket- 
book, wherein I had set down the names of several 
people and places which I had occasion to remember, 
and which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, 
and the words were never after to be read, to my 
great loss as to the names of some places which I 
touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Pekin: I had nobody 
with me but the youth, whom my nephew the captain 
had given me to attend me as a servant, and who 
proved very trusty and diligent ; and my partner had 
nobody with him but one servant, who was a kins- 
man. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous 
to see the court, we gave him his passage, that is to 
say, bore his charges for his company ; and to use 
him as an interpreter, for he understood the language 
of the country, and spoke good French and a little 
English; and indeed this old man was a most useful 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 1 

implement to us everywhere ; for we had not been 
above a week at Pekin, when he came laughing : 

"Ah, Seignior Inglese," said he, "I have some- 
thing to tell you, will make your heart glad." 

"My heart glad!" said I; "what can that be? 
I don't know anything in this country can either 
give me joy or grief, to any great degree." 

**Yes, y^s^* said the old man in broken English, 
" make you glad, me sorrow ; " sorry, he would have 
said. This made me more inquisitive. 

" Why," said I, " will it make you sorry ? " 

"Because," said he, "you have brought me here 

twenty-five days* journey, and will leave me to go 

back alone ; and which way shall I get to my port 

afterwards, without a ship, without a horse, without 

pecune ? " , so he called money ; being his broken 

Latin of which he had abundance to make us merry 

with. 
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of 

Muscovy and Polish merchants in the city, and that 

they were preparing to set out on their journey by 

land, to Muscovy, within four or five weeks, and he 

was sure we would take the opportunity to go with 

them, and leave him behind to go back alone. I 

confess I was surprised with this news: a secret joy 

spread itself over my whole soul, which I cannot 

describe, and never felt before or since ; and I had 

no power, for a good while, to speak a word to the 

old man ; but at last I turned to him : 

•* How do you know this?" said I : "are you sure 

itistrue.?" 



312 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

"Yes," he said, " I met this morning in the street 
an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one 
you call a Grecian, who is among them; he came 
last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Ton« 
quin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his 
mind, and is now resolved to go back with the cara- 
van to Moscow, and so down the river of Wolga to 
Astracan." 

" Well, Seignior," said I, " do not be uneasy about 
being left to go back alone ; if this be a method for 
my return to England, it shall be your fault if I go 
back to Macao at all." 

We then went to consult together what was to be 
done, and I asked my partner wliat he thought of the 
pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his af- 
fairs : he told me he would do just as I would ; for 
he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and 
left his effects in such good hands, that as we made 
a good voyage here, if we could vest it in China silks 
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the car- 
riage, he would be content to go to England, and 
then make his voyage back to Bengal by the Com- 
pany's ships.

— ATTACKED BY TARTARS^ WHO ARE DISPERSED BY 
THE RESOLUTION OF A SCOTS MERCHANT — THE OLD 
PILOT SAVES MY LIFE — WE ARE AGAIN ATTACKED, 
AND DEFEAT THE TARTARS. 

Having resolved upon this we agreed that, if our 
Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear 
his charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased ; 
nor indeed were we to be esteemed over-generous in 
that part neither, if we had not rewarded him further ; 
for the service he had done us was really worth all 
that, and more ; for he had not only been a pilot to 
us at sea, but he had been also like a broker for us 
on shore ; and his procuring for us the Japan mer- 
chant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. 
So we consulted together about it; and being willing 
to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him 
justice, and very willing also to have him with us 
besides, for he was a most necessary man on all 
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined 



314 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

gold, which as I compute it, came to about one 
hundred and seventy-five pounds sterling between 
us, and to bear his charges, both for himself and 
horse, except only a horse to carry his goods. 

Having settled this among ourselves, we called 
him to let him know what we had resolved : I told 
him he had complained of our being like to let him 
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were 
resolved he should not go back at all : that as we 
had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we 
resolved also he should go with us, and that we 
called him to know his mind. He shook his head, 
and said it was a long journey, and he had no pecune 
to carry him thither, nor to subsist himself when he 
came thither. We told him we believed it was so, 
and therefore we had resolved to do something for 
him that should let him see how sensible we were 
of the service he had done us, and also how agree* 
able he was to us ; and then I told him what we 
had resolved to give him here, which he might lay 
out as we would do our own ; and that as for his 
charges, if he would go with us, we would set him 
safe ashore (life and casualties excepted), either in 
Muscovy or in England, which he would, at our own 
charge, except only the carriage of his goods. 

He received the proposal like a man trans- 
ported, and told us he would go with us over the 
whole world ; and so, in short, we all prepared our- 
selves for the journey. However, as it was with us, 
so it was with the other merchants, they had many 
things to do; and instead of being ready in five 



OF ROBINSON CR USOE, 3 1 5 

weeks, it was four months and some odd days before 
all things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when 
we set out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot 
had gone express back to the port where we had first 
put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left 
there ; and I, with a Chinese merchant, whom I had 
some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to 
Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I 
bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two 
hundred pieces of other very fine silks, of several 
sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these 
brought to Pekin against my partner's return ; be- 
sides this, we bought a very large quantity of raw 
silk, and some other goods ; our cargo amounting, 
in these goods only, to about three thousand five 
hundred pounds sterling, which, together with tea, 
and some fine calicoes, and three camel-loads of 
nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels 
for our share, besides those we rode upon; which 
with two or three spare horses, and two horses 
loaded with provisions, made us, in short, twenty- 
six camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great, and as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hun- 
dred horses and camels, and upward of a hundred 
and twenty men, very well armed, and provided 
for all events. For as the Eastern caravans are sub- 
ject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the 
Tartars ; but they are not altogether so dangerous 
as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail. 



3i6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The company consisted of people of several na- 
tions, such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were 
about sixty of them who were merchants or in- 
habitants of Moscow, though of them some were 
Livonians: and to our particular satisfaction, five 
of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men 
of great experience in business, and very good sub- 
stance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the 
gentlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the 
passengers, except the servants, to a great council, 
as they termed it. At this great council every one 
deposited a certain quantity of money to a common 
stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on 
the way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and 
for satisfying the guides, getting horses, and the like. 
And here they constituted the journey, as they called 
it, viz., they named captains and officers to draw us 
all up, and give the command in case of an attack ; 
and gave every one their turn of command. Nor 
was this forming us into order any more than what 
we found needful upon the way, as shall be observed 
in its place. 

The road all on this side of the country is very 
populous, and is full of potters and earth-makers; 
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for the 
China ware ; and as I was going along, our Portu- 
guese pilot, who had always something or other to say 
to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me 
he would show the greatest rarity in all the country ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 317 

and tfaat I should have this to say of China, after all 
the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that I had 
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the 
world beside. I was very importunate to know what 
it was ; at last he told me, it was a gentleman's house 
built all with China ware. 

" Well," said I, " are not the materials of their 
building the product of their own country ; and so it 
is all China ware, is it not ? " 

" No, no," says he, " I mean, it is a house all made 
of China ware, such as you call so in England ; or, 
as it is called in our country, porcelain." 

"Well," said I, "such a thing may be: how big is 
it? can we carry it in a box upon a camel ? If we 
can, we will buy it" 

" Upon a camel 1 " said the old pilot, holding up 
both his hands ; " why there is a family of thirty 
people lives in it" 

I was then curious indeed to see it ; and when I 
came to see it, it was nothing but this : it was a 
timber house, or a house built, as we call it in Eng' 
land, with lath and plaster, but all the plastering was 
really China ware, that is to say, it was plastered 
with the earth that makes China war& 

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and 
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware 
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been 
burnt As to the inside, all the walls, instead of 
wainscot were lined with hardened and painted tiles, 
like the little square tiles we call galley tiles in Eng- 



3i8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

land, all made of the finest china, and the figures 
exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of 
colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one 
figure, but joined so artificially with mortar, being 
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see 
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were 
of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen 
floors we have in use in several parts of England, 
especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicester- 
shire, &c., as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt 
and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, 
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile : 
the ceilings, and, in a word, all the plastering work in 
the whole house, were of the same earth ; and, after 
all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of 
a deep shining black. 

This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and 
literally to be called so ; and had I not been upon 
the journey, I could have stayed some days to see 
and examine the particulars of it They told me 
there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all 
paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and 
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely 
formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they 
may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very sure 
they excel in their accounts of it ; for they told me 
such incredible things of their performance in crockery- 
ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as know- 
ing it could not be true. One told me, in particular, 
of a workman that made a ship, with all its tackle, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

and masts, and sails, in earthenware, big enough to 
carry fifty men. If he had told me he launched it, 
and made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said 
something to it indeed ; but as it was, I knew the 
whole story, which was, in short, asking pardon for 
the word, that the fellow lied ; so I smiled, and said 
nothing to it 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the 
caravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined 
me about the value of three shillings ; and told me, 
if it had been three days' journey without the wall, 
as it was three days' within, he must have fined me 
four times as much, and made me ask pardon the 
next council-day: so I promised to be more orderly; 
for indeed I found afterwards the orders made for 
keeping all together were absolutely necessary for 
our common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, 
made for a fortification against the Tartars: and a 
very great work it is, going over hills and mountains 
in an endless track, where the rocks are impassable, 
and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly 
enter, or indeed climb up, or where if they did, no 
wall could hinder them. They tell us, its length is 
near a thousand English miles, but that the country 
is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the 
wall bounds, without measuring the windings and 
turnings it takes : it is about four fathom high, and 
as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without tres- 
passing on our orders, for so long the caravan was 



320 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in passing the gate; I say, I stood still an hour to 
look at it, on every side, near and far off; I mean, 
what was within my view; and the guide of our 
caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder 
of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion 
of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to 
keep off the Tartars, which he happened not to un- 
derstand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli- 
ment : but the old pilot laughed. 

" O Seignior Inglese," said he, ** you speak in 
colours." 

*' In colours ! " said I ; " what do you mean by 
that ? " 

" Why, you speak what looks white this way, and 
black that way; gay one way, and dull another way: 
you tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars : 
you tell me, by that, it is good for nothing but to 
keep out Tartars ; or, will keep out none but Tartars. 
I understand you, Seignior Inglese, I understand 
you," said he, joking; "but Seignior Chinese under- 
stand you his own way." 

"Well," said I, "Seignior, do you think it would 
stand out an army of our country-people, with a good 
train of artillery; or our engineers, with two com- 
panies of miners ?. Would they not batter it down in 
ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or 
blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there 
should be no sign of it left ? " 

" Ay, ay," said he, " I know that." 

The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, 
and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, for 



OF ROBINSOiy CRUSOE. 321 

we were then almost out of their country, and he was 
to leave us in a little time afterwards \ but when he 
knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest of 
the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of 
the Chinese power and greatness while he stayed. 

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called 
a wall, something like the Ficts' wall so famous in 
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we began 
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people 
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities, as 
being subject to the inroads and depredations of the 
Tartars, who rob in great armies, and therefore are 
not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an 
open country. 

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping 
together in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw 
several troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I 
came to see them distinctly, I wondered how that the 
Chinese empire could be conquered by such contemp- 
tible fellows ; for they are a mere herd or crowd of 
wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no 
discipline or manner of fight. 

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, 
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing ; and this 
we found the first day we saw them, which was 
after we entered the wilder part of the country. 
Our leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen 
of us to go a-hunting, as they call it ; and what was 
this but hunting of sheep! However, it may be 
called hunting too ; for the creatures arc the wildest 
and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind ; 

VOL. n. X 



322 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

only they will not run a great way, and you are sure 
of sport when you begin the chase ; for they appear 
generally by thirty or forty in a flock, and like true 
sheep always keep together when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap 
to meet with about forty Tartars : whether they were 
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked 
for another kind of prey, I know not, but as soon as 
they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very 
loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never heard 
before, and, by the way, never care to hear again. 
We all supposed this was to call their friends about 
them ; and so it was ; for in less than half a quarter 
of an hour, a troop of forty or fifty more appeared at 
about a mile distance ; but our work was over first, 
as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened 
to be amongst us ; and as soon as he heard the horn, 
he told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but to 
charge them immediately, without loss of time ; and 
drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved? 
We told him we were ready to follow him; so he rode 
directly up to them. They stood gazing at us like a 
mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor showing the 
face of any order at all ; but as soon as they saw us 
advance, they let fly their arrows, which, however, 
missed us very happily ; it seems they mistook not 
their aim, but their distance ; for their arrows all fell 
a little short of us, but with so true an aim, that had 
we been about twenty yards nearer, we must have 
had several men wounded, if not killed. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 323 

Immediately we halted;- and though it was at a 
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets 
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop, re- 
solving to fall in among them sword in hand ; for so 
our bold Scot that led us directed. He was indeed 
but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and 
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool 
courage too, that I never saw any man in action 
fitter for command. As soon as we came up to 
them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and then 
drew ; but they fled in the greatest confusion ima- 
ginable ; the only stand any of them made was on 
our right, where three of them stood, and by signs 
called the rest to come back to them, having a kind 
of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hansrinof at 
their backs. Our brave commander, without asking 
anybody to follow him, galloped up close to them, 
and with his fusil knocked one of them off his horse, 
killed the second with his pistol, and the third ran 
away; and thus ended our fight; but we had this 
misfortune attending it, viz., that all our mutton that 
we had in chase got away. We had not a man killed 
or hurt; but as for the Tartars, there were about five 
of them killed ; how many were wounded, we knew 
not ; but this we knew, that the other party was so 
frighted with the noise of our guns, that they fled, 
and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, 
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after- 
wards; but in about five days we entered a vast great 
wild desert, which held us three days' and nights' 



< 



324 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

march ; and we were obliged to carry our water with 
us in great leather bottles, and to encamp all night, 
just as I have heard they do in the deserts of Arabia. 

I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in ? 
and they told me this was a kind of border that might 
be called No Man's Land ; being part of the Great 
Karakathy, or Grand Tartary ; but that, however, it 
was reckoned to China ; that there was no care taken 
Jiere to preserve it from the inroads of thieves ; and 
therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the 
whole march, though we were to go over some much 
larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at 
the first view very frightful to me, we saw two or three 
times little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to 
be upon their own affairs, and to have no design upon 
us ; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they 
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to 
them ; we let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to 
stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider 
what they should do, viz., to attack us, or not attack 
us, we knew not ; but when we were passed at some 
distance by them, we made a rear guard of forty men, 
and stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass 
half a mile, or thereabouts, before us. After a while 
they marched off, only we found they assaulted us 
with five arrows at their parting; one of which 
wounded a horse so that it disabled him, and we left 
him thenext day, poor creature, in great need of a good 
farrier. We suppose they might shoot more arrows, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

which might fall short of us ; but we saw no more 
arrows or Tartars at that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
being not so good as at first, though still in the domi- 
nions of the Emperor of China ; but lay, for the most 
part, in villages, some of which were fortified, because 
of the incursions of the Tartars. When we came to 
one of these towns (it was about two days and a half s 
journey before we were to come to the city of Naum), 
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to 
be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses also, 
such as they are, because so many caravans coming 
that way, they are very often wanted. The person 
that I spoke to, to get me a camel, would have gone 
and fetched it for me ; but I, like a fool, must be 
officious, and go myself along with him. The place 
was about two miles out of the village, where it seems 
they kept the camels and horses feeding under a 
guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company, 
and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of a little 
variety. When we came to this place, it was a low 
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled 
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a 
park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the 
doors. Having bought a camel, and agreed for the 
price, I came away ; and the Chinese man, that went 
with me, led the camel, when on a sudden came up 
five Tartars on horseback ; two of them seized the 
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the other 
three stepped up to me and my old pilot ; seeing us, 



326 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me 
but my sword, which could but ill defend me against 
three horsemen. The first that came up stopped 
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are ar- 
rant cowards), but a second coming upon my left, 
gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till 
afterwards, and wondered, when I came to myself, 
what was the matter with me, and where I was, for 
he laid me flat on the ground ; but my never-failing 
old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlooked for, 
directs deliverances from dangers, which to us are un- 
foreseen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew 
nothing of nor the Tartars neither ; if they had I sup- 
pose they would not have attacked us ; but cowards 
are always boldest when there is no danger. 

The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart 
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and lay- 
ing hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him 
down by main force a little towards him with the other, 
he shot him into the head, and laid him dead on the 
spot ; he then immediately stepped up to him who had 
stopped us, as I said, and before he could come forward 
again (for it was all done as it were in a moment), 
made a blow at him with a scimitar which he always 
wore, but missing the man, cut his horse into the side of 
his head, cut one of his ears off by the root, and a great 
slice down the side of his face. The poor beast, en- 
raged with the wounds, was no more to be governed 
by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too; 
but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the 
pilot's reach ; and, at some distance, rising upon his 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, yrj 

hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon 
him. 

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had 
lost the camel, but he had no weapon ; however, see- 
ing^ the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him, 
he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured 
weapon he had by his side, something like a pole- 
axe, but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from 
him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains 
out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar 
to deal with still; and seeing he did not fly as he 
expected, nor came on to fight him, as he apprehended, 
but stood stock still, the old man stood still too, and 
falls to work with his tackle to chaise his pistol again : 
but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he 
supposed it to be the same or another, I know not ; 
but away he scoured, and left my pilot, my cham- 
pion I called him afterwards, a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for I thought, 
when I first began to awake, that I had been in a 
sweet sleep; but as I said above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was 
the matter ; in a word, a few minutes after, as sense 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where ; 
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody ; then I felt my head ache, and then, in 
another moment, memory returned, and everything 
was present to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold 
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a 
Tartar lying dead, and his horse standing very quietly 



328 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

by him ; and looking further I saw my champion and 
deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had 
done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. 
The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to 
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being 
afraid before that I had been killed ; and seeing me 
bloody, would see how I was hurt; but it was not 
much, only what we call a broken head ; neither did 
I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the 
blow, other than the place which was hurt, and which 
was well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory ; 
for we lost a camel and gained a horse : but that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
vills^e, the man demanded to be paid for the camel ; 
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before 
the Chinese judge of the place ; that is to say, in 
English, we went before a justice of the peace. Give 
him his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence 
and impartiality; and having heard both sides he 
gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me to 
buy the camel whose servant he was ? 

" I am no servant," said he, ** but went with the 
stranger." 

" At whose request ? " said the justice. 

** At the stranger's request," said he. 

"Why, then," said the justice, "you were the 
stranger's servant for the time ; and the camel being 
delivered to his servant, it was delivered to him, and 
he must pay for it." 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 329 

word to say ; but admiring to see such just reasoning 
upon the consequence, and so accurate stating the 
case, I paid willingly for the camel, and sent for 
another; but you may observe, I sent for it; I did 
not go to fetch it myself any more; I had had 
enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese 
empire : they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifi- 
cations go there; for this I will venture to affirm, 
that all the Tartars in Karakathy, which, I believe, 
are some millions, could not batter down the walls 
with their bows and arrows ; but to call it strong, if 
it were attacked with cannon, would be to make 
those who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, about two days' journey 
of this city, when messengers were sent express to 
every part of the road, to tell all travellers and 
caravans to halt till they had a guard sent to them ; 
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten 
thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about 
thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, it 
was carefully done of the governor, and we were very 
glad to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly, 
two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us 
from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three 
hundred more from the city of Naum, and with those 
we advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from 
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our 
rear, and our men on each side of our camels with 
our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre. 



330 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In this order, and well prepared for battle, we 
thought ourselves a match for the whole ten thou- 
sand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the 
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another 
thing. 

It was early in the morning, when marching from 
a little well-situated town, called Changu, we had a 
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry; and 
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been 
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan 
being over, the rear guard was behind : but they did 
not appear there. 

About three hours after, when we were entered 
upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an 
enemy was at hand ; and they were at hand indeed, 
for they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had 
talked so big the day before, began to stagger, and 
the soldiers frequently looked behind them ; which 
is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to 
run away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and being 
near me, he called out : 

" Seignior Inglese," said he, " those fellows must be 
encouraged, or they will ruin us all ; for if the Tartars 
come on, they will never stand it" 

" I am of your mind," said I : " but what course 
must be done ? " 

" Done ? " said he ; ** let fifty of our men advance, 
and flank them on each wing, and encourage them, 
and they will fight like brave fellows in brave com- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 331 

pany ; but without it, they will every man turn his 
back." 

Immediately I rode up to our leader, and told him, 
who was exactly of our mind ; and accordingly fifty 
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left, 
and the rest made a line of reserve ; for so we marched, 
leaving the last two hundred men to make another 
body to themselves, and to guard the camels; only 
that, if need were, they should send a hundred men 
to assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumer- 
able company they were; how many we could not 
tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. A 
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, 
traversing the ground in the front of our line ; and 
as we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered 
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a 
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done ; 
but they went off, and I suppose went back to give 
an account of the reception they were like to meet 
-with, and indeed that salute clogged their stomachs; 
for they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider 
of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over the 
design, and said no more to us for that time, which 
was very agreeable to our circumstances, which were 
but very indifferent for a battle with such a number.

CHAPTER XV. 

FURTHER ACCOUNT OF OUR JOURNBY DESCRIPTION 

OF AN IDOLy WHICH WE DESTROY — GREAT DANGER 
WE INCUR THEREBY — ACCOUNT OF OUR TRAVELS 
THROUGH MUSCOVY. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naum, or 
Naunm. We thanked the governor for his care for 
us, and collected to the value of one hundred crowns, 
or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent 
to guard us ; and here we rested one day. This is a 
garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers 
kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the 
Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they do 
now, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of 
the country (which lies from the city west, for about 
two hundred miles) as desolate and unfit for use, and 
more especially, being so very remote, and so difficult 
to send troops hither for its defence; for we had yet 
above two thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so 
called. 

After this we passed several great rivers, and two 
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days 
passing over, and which, as I said, was to be called 
No Man's Land ; and on the 13th of April we came 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 333 

to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think 
the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it might 
be called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was 
called Argun, being on the west side of the river 
Argun. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction 
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian 
country, or, at least, in a country governed by Chris- 
tians ; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, 
but just deserve the name of Christians (yet such 
they pretend to be, and are very devout in their 
way), it would certainly occur to any man who 
travels the world as I have done, and who had any 
power of reflection, I say, it would occur to him, to 
reflect what a blessing it is to be brought into the 
world where the name of God and of a Redeemer is 
known, worshipped, and adored — and not where the 
people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions, 
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks 
and stones ; worship monsters, elements, horrible- 
shaped animals, and statues, or images of monsters. 
Not a town or city we passed through but had their 
pagods, their idols, and their temples ; and ignorant 
people worshipping even the works of their own 
bands ! 

Now we came where, at least, a face of the 
Christian worship appeared, where the knee was 
bowed to Jesus ; and whether ignorantly or not, yet 
the Christian religion was owned, and the name of 
the true God was called upon and adored ; and it 
made the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it. 



334 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I saluted the brave Scotch merchant I mentioned 
above, with my first acknowledgment of this; and 
taking him by the hand, I said to him : 

'' Blessed be God, we are once again come among 
Christians ! " 

He smiled, and answered : 

"Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these 
Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians; and 
but for the name of it, you may see very little of 
the substance for some months further of our 
journey." 

"Well," said I, "but still it is better than pagan- 
ism, and worshipping of devils." 

" Why ril tell you," said he ; "except the Russian 
soldiers in garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of 
the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, 
for above a thousand miles further, is inhabited by 
the worst and most ignorant of pagans." And so 
indeed we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of 
solid earth, if I understand anything of the surface 
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
world : we had at least twelve hundred miles to the 
sea, eastward ; we had at least two thousand to the 
bottom of the Baltic sea, westward ; and almost 
three thousand miles, if we left that sea and went 
on west to the British and French Channels; we 
had full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian 
sea, south; and about eight hundred miles to the 
Frozen sea, north; nay, if some people may be 
believed, there might be no sea north-east till we 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 335 

came round the pole, and consequently into the 
north-west, and so had a continent of land into 
America, no mortal knows where ; though I could 
give some reasons why I believe that to be a mis- 
take too. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a 
good while before we came to any considerable 
town, we had nothing to observe there but this: 
first, that all the rivers run to the east. As I under- 
stood by the charts which some of our caravans had 
with them, it was plain that all those rivers ran into 
the great river Yamour, or Gammour. This river, 
by the natural course of it, must run into the east 
sea, or Chinese ocean. The story they tell us, that 
the mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes 
of a monstrous growth, viz., three feet about, and 
twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say 
I believe nothing of ; but as Its navigation is of no 
use, because there is no trade that way, the Tartars, 
to whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but 
cattle; so nobody that ever I heard of, has been 
curious enough either to go down to the mouth of it 
in boats, or to come up from the mouth of it in ships ; 
but this is certain, that this river running due east, in 
the latitude of sixty degrees, carries a vast con- 
course of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean 
to empty itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea 
there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are 
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as due 
north as the Yamour runs east; and these are all 



336 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

found to join their waters with the great river Tar- 
tarus, named so from the northernmost nations of the 
Mogul Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the first 
Tartars in the world ; and who, as our geographers 
allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred 
story. 

These rivers running all northward, as well as all 
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that 
side ; so that it does not seem rational in the least 
to think that the land can extend itself to join with 
America on that side, or that there is not a com- 
munication between the northern and the eastern 
ocean ; but of this I shall say no more ; it was my 
observation at that time, and therefore I take notice 
of it in this place. We now advanced from the river 
Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, and were 
very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Muscovy 
has taken to have cities and towns built in as many 
places as are possible to place them, where his soldiers 
keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers 
placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of 
their empire, some of which I had read were parti- 
cularly placed in Britain for the security of commerce, 
and for the lodging of travellers; and thus it was 
here ; though wherever we came at these towns and 
stations, the garrisons and governor were Russians 
and professed mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and 
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host 
of heaven ; and not only so, but were, of all the 
heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 337 

barbarous, except only that they did not eat man's 
flesh, as our savages of America did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country 
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite 
dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians to- 
gether, called Nertzinskay ; in which space is a con* 
tinued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days 
to travel over it. In a village near the last of those 
places, I had the curiosity to go and see their way 
of living ; which is most brutish and unsufferable. 
They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day ; for 
there stood out upon an old stump of a tree, an idol 
made of wood, frightful as the devil, at least as any- 
thing we can think of to represent the devil that can 
be made. It had a head, certainly, not so much as 
resembling any creature that the world ever saw; 
ears as big as goats' horns, and as high ; eyes as big 
as a crown-piece ; and a nose like a crooked ram's 
horn, and a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of 
a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under 
bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner that 
you can suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep- 
skin, with the wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet 
on the head, with two horns growing through it ; it 
was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, 
or any other proportion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the 
village ; and when I came near to it, there were six- 
teen or seventeen creatures, whether men or women 
I could not tell, for they make no distinction by their 

habits, either of body or head ; these lay all flat on 
VOL. II. Y 



338 THE, LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the ground, round this formidable block of shape* 
less wood. I saw no motion among them any more 
than if they had been logs of wood, like their idol; 
at first I really thought they had been so ; but when 
I came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet, 
and raised a howling cry, as if it had been so many 
deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as if they 
were displeased at our disturbing theoL A little way 
off from this monster, and at the door of a tent or hut, 
made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins, dried, stood 
three butchers ; I thought they were such ; for when 
I came nearer to them, I found they had long knives 
in their hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared 
three sheep killed, and one young bullock or steer. 
These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log 
of an idol ; and these three men priests belonging to 
it ; and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the 
people who brought the offering, and were making 
their prayers to that stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and 
this brutish worship of a hol^oblin, than ever I was 
at anything in my life ; to see God's most glorious 
and best creature, to whom He had granted so many 
advantages, even by creation, above the rest of the 
works of His hands, vested with a reasonable soul, 
and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities 
adapted both to honour his Maker and be honoured 
by Him ; I say, to see it sunk and degenerated to a 
degree so more than stupid, as to prostrate itself to a 
frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed up 
by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 339 

their own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and 
rags; and that this should be the effect of mere 
ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by the 
devil himself; who, envying his Maker the homage 
and adoration of His creatures, had deluded them into 
such gross, surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things as 
one would think should shock nature itself. 

But what signified all the astonishment and reflec- 
tion of thoughts ? Thus it was, and I saw it before 
my eyes ; and there was no room to wonder at it, 
or think it impossible. All my admiration turned to 
rage ; and I rode up to the image or monster, call it 
what you will, and with my sword cut the bonnet 
that was on its head in two in the middle, so that it 
hung down by one of the horns ; and one of our men 
that was with me, took hold of the sheep-skin that 
covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a most 
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, 
and two or three hundred people came about my ears, 
so that I was glad to scour for it : for we saw some 
had bows and arrows; but I resolved from that 
moment to visit them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which 
was about four miles off, in order to provide some 
horses which they wanted, several of the horses having 
been lamed and jaded with the badness of the way, 
and our long march over the last desert ; so we had 
some leisure here to put my design in execution. I 
communicated my project to the Scots merchant, of 
Moscow, of whose courage I had had a sufficient 
testimony, as above. I told him what I had seen, 



340 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

and with what indignation I had since thoij^ht that 
human nature could be so degenerate. I told him I 
was resolved, if I could get but four or five men well 
armed to go with me, to go and destroy that vile, 
abominable idol; to let them see that it had no 
power to help itself, and consequently could not be 
an object of worship, or to be prayed to, much less 
help them that offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me : said he — 

" Your zeal may be good ; but what do you pro- 
pose to yourself by it ? " 

" Propose I " said I : '^ to vindicate the honour of 
God, which is insulted by this devil-worship.'' 

''But how will it vindicate the honour of God," 
said he, '^ while the people will not be able to know 
what you mean by it, unless you could speak to them 
too, and tell them so ? and then they will fight you 
too, I will assure you, for they are desperate fellows^ 
and that especially in defence of their idolatry." 

" Can we not," said I, " do it in the night, and then 
leave them the reasons in writing in their own lan- 
guage ? " 

" Writing 1" said he; "why, there is not in five 
nations of them one man that knows anything of a 
letter, or how to read a word in any language, or in 
their own." 

" Wretched ignorance ! " said I to him : " however, 
I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature may 
draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how 
brutish they are to worship such horrid things." 

"Look you, sir," said he, **if your zeal prompts 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 541 

you to it so warmly, you must do it ; but in the next 
place, I would have you consider these wild nations 
of people are subjected by force to the Czar of 
Muscovy's dominion; and if you do this, it is ten 
to one but they will come by thousands to the 
governor of Nertzinskay, and complain, and demand 
satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, 
it is ten to one but they revolt ; and it will occasion 
a new war with all the Tartars in the country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for 
a while ; but I harped upon the same string still ; 
and all that day I was uneasy to put my project in 
execution. Towards the evening the Scots merchant 
met me by accident in our walk about the town, and 
desired to speak with me : 

" I believe," said he, " I have put you off your good 
design; I have been a little concerned about it since; 
for I abhor the idol and idolatry as much as you can 
do." 

•* Truly," said I, " you have put it off a little, as to 
the execution of it, but you have not put it all out of 
my thoughts ; and I believe I shall do it still before 
I quit this place, though I were to be delivered up to 
them for satisfaction." 

" No, no," said he, " God forbid they should deliver 
you up to such a crew of monsters ! they shall not do 
that neither; that would be murdering you indeed." 

" Why," said I, " how would they use me ? " 

" Use you ! " said he : " I'll tell you how they served 
a poor Russian, who affronted them in their worship 
just as you did, and whom they took prisoner, after 



342 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they had lamed him with an arrow, that he could not 
run away: they took him and stripped him stark 
naked, and set him upon the top of the idol monster, 
and stood all round him, and shot as many arrows 
into him as would stick over his whole body; and 
then they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in 
him, as a sacrifice to the idol." 

*' And was this the same idol ? " said I. 

" Yes," said he, " the very same." 

" Well," said I, " I will tell you a story." 

So I related the story of our men at Madagascar, 
and how they burnt and sacked the village there, and 
killed man, woman, and child, for their murdering one 
of our men, just as it is related before ; and when I 
had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do so 
to this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story; but 
when I talked of doing so to that village, said he : 

" You mistake very much ; it was not this village, 
it was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but 
it was the same idol, for they carry him about in pro- 
cession all over the country." 

"Well," said I, " then that idol ought to be punished 
for it ; and it shall," said I, " if I live this night out" 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the de- 
sign, and told me I should not go alone, but he 
would go with me ; but he would go first, and bring 
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also witii 
us; "and one," said he, "as famous for his zeal as 
you can desire any one to be against such devilish 
things as these." In a word, he brought me his 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 343 

comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain 
Richardson ; and I gave him a full account of what 
I had seen, and also what I intended ; and he told 
me readily he would go with me, if it cost him his 
life. So we agreed to go, only we three. I had 
indeed proposed it to my partner, but he declined 
it He saidi he was ready to assist me to the ut- 
most, and upon all occasions, for my defence; but 
that this was an adventure quite out of his way ; so, 
I say, we resolved upon our work, only we three, 
and my man-servant, and to put it in execution 
that night about midnight, with all the secrecy 
imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing 
to delay it to the next night, because the caravan 
being to set forward in the morning, we supposed 
the governor could not pretend to give them any 
satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power. 
The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution to 
enterprise it as bold in executing^ brought me a 
Tartar's robe, or gown, of sheep-*skin, and a bonnet, 
with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same 
for himself and his countryman, that the people, if 
they saw us, should not be able to determine who 
we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some 
combustible matter with aquavits, gunpowder^ and 
such other materials as we could get ; and having a 
good quantity of tar in a little pot^ about an hour 
after night we set out upon our expedition* 

We came to the p^ace about eleven o'clock at 



344 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

night, and found that the people had not the least 
jealousy of danger attending their idoL The night 
was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough to 
see that the idol stood just in the same posture and 
place that it did before. The people seemed to be 
all at their rest ; only that in the great hut or tent 
as we called it, where we saw the three priests whom 
we mistook for butchers, we saw a light, and going 
up close to the door, we heard people talking, as if 
there were five or six of them ; we concluded, there- 
fore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, these men 
would come out immediately and run up to the 
place to rescue it from the destruction that we in- 
tended for it ; and what to do with them we knew 
not. Once we thought of carrying it away, and 
setting fire to it at a distance, but when we came to 
handle it we found it too bulky for our carriage ; so 
we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman was 
for setting fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the 
creatures that were there on the head, when they 
came out; but I could not join with that; I was 
against killing them, if it was possible to be avoided. 

" Well then," said the Scots merchant, ** I will tell 
you what we will do; we will try to make them 
prisoners, tie their hands, and make them stand and 
see their idol destroyed." 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread 
enough about us, which we used to tie our fireworks 
together with ; so we resolved to attack these people 
first, and with as little noise as we could. The first 
thing we did, we knocked at the door, when one of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 345 

the priests coming to it, we immediately seized upon 
him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind 
him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged him, 
that he might not make a noise, tied his feet also 
together, and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that 
another would come out to see what the matter was ; 
but we waited so long till the third man came back 
to us ; and then nobody coming out, we knocked 
again gently, and immediately out came two more, 
and we served them just in the same manner, but 
were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down 
by the idol some distance from one another ; when 
going back we found two more were come out to 
the door, and a third stood behind them within the 
door. We seized the two, and immediately tied 
them, when the third stepping back, and crying out, 
my Scots merchant went in after him, and taking 
out a composition we had made, that would only 
smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it among 
them : by that time the other Scotsman and my man 
taking charge of the two men already bound, and 
tied tc^ether also by the arm, led them away to the 
idol, and left them there, to see if their idol would 
relieve them, making haste back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the 
hut with so much smoke that they were almQ3t suf- 
focated, we then threw in a small leather bag of 
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and follow- 
ing it in, we found there were but four people left, 
who, it seems, were two men and two women, and, as 



346 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we supposed, had been about some of their diabolic 
sacrifices. They appeared, ia short, frighted to 
death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and 
not able to speak neither, for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had 
the other, and all without any noise. I should have 
said, we brought them out of the house, or hut, first ; 
for indeed we were not able to bear the smoke any 
more than they were. When we had done this, we 
carried them all together to the idol : when we came 
there we fell to work with him ; and first we daubed 
him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and such 
other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed with 
brimstone ; then we stopped his ^yts^ and ears, and 
mouth full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a 
great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then, 
sticking all the combustibles we had brought with 
us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find 
an)rthing else to help to burn him ; when my Scots- 
man remembered that by the tent, or hut, where the 
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether 
straw or rushes I do not remember, away he and the 
other Scotsman ran, and fetched their arms full of 
that. When we had done this, we took all our 
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet 
and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand 
up, and set them just before their monstrous idol, and 
then set fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or there- 
abouts, till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and 
ears of the idol blew up, and as we could perceive, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 347 

had split and deformed the shape of it: and, in a 
word, till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log 
of wood ; and then setting the dry forage to it, we 
found it would be soon quite consumed ; so we began 
to think of going away ; but the Scotsman said, " No, 
we must not go, for these poor deluded wretches will 
all throw themselves into the fire, and burn them- 
selves with the idol." So we resolved to stay till the 
forage was burnt down too, and then we came away 
and left them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow- 
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our 
journey; nor could any man suggest that we had 
been anywhere but in our beds, as travellers might 
be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigues 
of that day's journey. 

But it did not end so ; for the next day came a 
great multitude of the country people, not only of 
this village, but of a hundred more, for aught I know, 
to the town-gates ; and in a most outrageous manner 
demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor, for 
the insulting their priests, and burning their great 
Cham-Chi-Thaungu ; such a hard name they gave 
the monstrous creature they worshipped. The 
people of Nertzinskay were at first in a great con- 
sternation ; for they said the Tartars were no less 
than thirty thousand, and that in a few days more 
they would be one hundred thousand stronger. 

The Russian governor sent out messengers to 
appease them, and gave them all the good words 
imaginable. He assured them he knew nothing of 



348 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

it, and that there had not a soul of his garrison been 
abroad ; that it could not be from anybody there ; 
and if they would let him know who it was, be should 
be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily. 
That all the country reverenced the great Cham-Chi- 
Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would 
have dared to offer violence to his image, but some 
Christian miscreant ; so they called them, it seems ; 
and they therefore denounced war against him, and 
all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and 
Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make 
a breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be 
given by him, the Czar having straitly charged him 
to treat the conquered country with gentleness and 
civility, gave them still all the good words he could ; 
at last he told them there was a caravan gone towards 
Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of 
them who had done them this injury; and that, if 
they would be satisfied with that, he would send after 
them, to inquire into it This seemed to appease 
them a little ; and accordingly the governor sent after 
us, and gave us a particular account how the thing 
was, intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had 
done it, they should make their escape; but that 
whether they had done it, or no, we should make all 
the haste forward that was possible ; and that in the 
meantime he would keep them in play as long as he 
could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. However, 
when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 349 

anything of the matter; and as for us that were 
guilty, we were the least of all suspected : none so 
much as asked us the question ; however the captain 
of the caravan, for the time, took the hint that the 
governor gave us, and we marched or travelled two 
days and two nights without any considerable stop, 
and then we lay at a village called Plothus ; nor did 
we make any long stop here, but hastened on towards 
Jarawena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, 
and where we expected we should be safe ; but it is 
to be observed that here we began, for two or three 
days' march, to enter upon a vast nameless desert, of 
which I shall say more in its place ; and which if we 
had now been upon it, it is more than probable we had 
been all destroyed. It was the second day's march 
from Plothus, that by the clouds of dust behind us 
at a great distance, some of our people began to be 
sensible we were pursued ; we had entered the desert, 
and had passed by a great lake, called Schanks 
Osier, when we perceived a very great body of horse 
appear on the other side of the lake to the north, we 
travelling west We observed they went away west, 
as we did ; but had supposed we should have taken 
that side of the lake, whereas we very happily took 
the south side : and in two days more we saw them not, 
for they believing we were still before them, pushed 
on, till they came to the river Udda : this is a very 
great river when it passes further north, but when we 
came to it, we found it narrow and fordable. 

The third day they either found their mistake, or 
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us 



350 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to our 
great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our 
camp, which was very convenient for the night; for 
as we were upon a desert, though but at the begin* 
ning of it, that was above five hundred miles over, 
we had no towns to lodge at, and indeed expected 
none but the city of Jarawena, which we had yet two 
days' march to ; the desert, however, had some few 
woods in it on this side, and little rivers which ran 
all into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow 
strait, between two small but very thick woods, that 
we pitched our little camp for that night, expecting 
to be attacked in the night 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued 
for ; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go 
about in troops in that desert, so the caravans alwa)rs 
fortify themselves every night against them, as 
against armies of robbers ; and it was therefore no 
new thing to be pursued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our 
travels, a most advantageous camp ; for we lay be- 
tween two woods, with a little rivulet running just 
before our front ; so that we could not be surrounded 
or attacked any way, but in our front or rear: we 
took care also to make our front as strong as we 
could, by placing our packs, with our camels and 
horses, all in a line on the side of the river, and we 
felled some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night; but 
the enemy was upon us before we had finished our 
situation : they did not come on us like thieves, as 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 351 

we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to 
demand the men to be delivered to them, that had 
abused their priests, and burned their god Cham-Chi- 
Thaungu, that they might burn them with fire ; and 
upon this, they said, they would go away, and do us 
no further harm, otherwise they would burn us all 
with fire. Our men looked very blank at this 
message, and began to stare at one another, to see 
who looked with most guilt in their faces, but, no- 
body was the word, nobody did it. The leader of the 
caravan sent word he was well assured it was not 
done by any of our camp ; that we were peaceable 
merchants, travelling on our business ; that we had 
done no harm to them, or to any one else ; and there- 
fore they must look further for their enemies who 
had injured them, for we were not the people ; so 
desired them not to disturb us ; for, if they did, we 
should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this for an 
answer, and a great crowd of them came down in the 
morning, by break of day, to our camp; but seeing 
us in such an advantageous situation, they durst 
come no further than the brook in our front, where 
thev stood and showed us such a number, as indeed 
terrified us very much ; for those that spoke least of 
them, spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and 
looked at us awhile, and then, setting up a great 
howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among us ; but 
we were well enough fortified for that, for we were 
sheltered under our baggage ; and I do not remember 
that one man of us was hurt 



352 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Some time after this we saw them move a little 
to our right, and expected them on the rear, when 
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of 
Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the 
leader of the caravan, said to him, ^ I will send all 
these people away to Sibeilka." This was a city four 
or five days' journey at least to the south, and rather 
behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and 
getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear 
directly, as it were, back to Nertzinskay ; after this, 
he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the army 
of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell 
them a long story, that the people who had burnt 
their Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with 
a caravan of miscreants, as he called them ; that is to 
say, Christians ; and that they were resolved to bum 
the god Seal Isarg, belonging to the Tonguses. 

As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly 
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that 
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in a 
most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems, was 
five days' journey to the south ; and in less than 
three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and we 
never heard any more of them, nor ever knew whether 
they went to that other place called Sibeilka or no. 

So we passed safely on to the city of Jarawena, 
where there was a garrison of Muscovites ; and there 
we rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the last day's march, and with want of 
rest in the night 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 353 

held us three-and-twenty days' march. We furnished 
ourselves with some tents here, for the better accom- 
modating ourselves in the night ; and the leader of 
the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or waggons, 
of the country, for carrying our water and provisions ; 
and these carriages were our defence every night 
round our little camp ; so that had the Tartars ap- 
peared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, 
they would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to want rest again after 
this long journey ; for in this desert we saw neither 
house nor tree, nor scarce a bush ; we saw, indeed, 
abundance of the sable-hunters, as they called them. 
These are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which 
this country is a part; and they frequently attack 
small caravans; but we saw no numbers of them 
together. I was curious to see the sable-skins thev 
catched ; but I could never speak with any of them : 
for they durst not come near us; neither durst we 
straggle from our company to go near them. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we 
found towns and castles settled by the Czar of Mus- 
covy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect 
the caravans, and defend the country against the 
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very dangerous 
travelling; and his czarish majesty has given such 
strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and 
merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard of in 
the country, detachments of the garrison are always 

sent fo see travellers safe from station to station. 
VOL. II. z 



3H THE UFS AND ADVENTURES 

And thus the governor of Adiaskoy» whom I bad 
an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the 
Scots merchanti who was acquainted with him, offered 
us a guard of fifty men, if wq thought there was any 
danger, to the next station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe we should find the country better peopled, 
and the people more civilised ; but I found myself 
mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the 
Tonguses to pass through ; w here we saw the same 
tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse, than 
before; only as they were conquered by the Musco- 
vites, and entirely reduced, they were not so dan- 
gerous; but for the rudeness of manners, idolatry^ 
and polytheism, no people in the world ever went 
beyond them. They are all clothed in skins of 
beasts, and their houses are built of the same. You 
know not a man from a woman, neither by the 
rugged ness of their countenances, nor their clothes ; 
and in the winter, when the ground is covered with 
snow, they live under ground, in houses like vaults, 
which have cavities or caves going from one to 
another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi«Thaungu for 
a whole village or country, these had idols in every 
hut and every cave ; besides, they worship the stars, 
the sun, the water, the snow ; and, in a word, every- 
thing that they do not understand, and they under- 
stand but very little \ so that almost every element, 
every uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing. 

But I am no more to describe people than coub- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3S5 

tries, any further tban my own story conies toi be 

concerned tn them. I met with nothing peculiar to 
myself in all this country, which I reckon was, frpm 
Ifae desert which I spoke of last, at least four hundred 
miles, half of it being another desert, which took ua 
Qp twelve days' severe travelling, without house, tree, 
or bush; but we were obliged again to carry our own 
provisions, as well water as bread.. After we were out 
of this desert, and had travelled two days, we came 
to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station, on the 
great river Janezay. This river, tb^ told us, parted 
Europe from Asia, though our map-makers, as I 
am told, do not agree to it ; however, it is certainly 
the eastern boundary of the ancient Siberia, whit^ 
now makes a province only of the vast Muscovite 
empire, but is itself equal in bigness to the whole 
empire of Germany. 

And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism 
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. 
All the country between the river Oby and the river 
Janezay is as entirely pagan, and tbe people as bar- 
barous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; nay, as any 
nation, for aught 1 know, In Asia or America. I 
also found, which I observed to the Muscovite go- 
vernors whom I had opportunity to converse with, 
that the pagans are not much tbe wiser, or the nearer 
Christianity, for being under the Muscovite govern- 
ment : which they acknowledged was true ertough, 
but they said it was none of their business ; that if 
the Czar expected to convert his Siberian, or Too- 
guese, or Tartar subjects, it should be done by 



3S6. THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sending clergymen among them/ not soldiers; and 
they added, with more sincerity than I expected, 
that they found it was not so much the concern of 
their monarch to make the people Christians as it 
was to make them subjects. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed 
a wild uncultivated country ; I cannot say it is a bar- 
barous soil ; it is only barren of people, and wants 
good management; otherwise it is in itself a most 
pleasant, fruitful, and s^reeable country. What in- 
habitants we found in it are all pagans, except such 
as are sent among them from Russia ; for this is the 
country, I mean on both sides the river Oby, whither 
the Muscovite criminals that are not put to death are 
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible 
they should ever come away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular 
affairs till I came to Tobolsk!, the capital of Siberia, 
where I continued some time on the following occa- 
sion : — 

We had been now almost seven months on our 
journey, and winter began to come on apace; where- 
upon my partner and I called a council about our 
particular affairs, in which we found it proper, con- 
sidering that we were bound for England, and not 
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. 
They told us of sledges and rein-deer to carry us 
over the snow in the winter time ; and indeed they 
have such things as it would be incredible to re- 
late the particulars of, by which means the Russians 
travel more in the winter than they can in summer; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 357 

because in these sledges they are able to run night 
and day; the snow being frozen, is one universal 
covering to nature, by which the hills, the vales, the 
rivers, the lakes, are all smooth and hard as a stone ; 
and they run upon the surface without any regard to 
what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey 
of this kind ; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, 
and my route lay two ways : either I must go on as 
the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then go 
off west for Narva, and the Gulf of Finland, and so 
either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I might 
possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage ; or 
I must leave the caravan at a little town on the 
Dwina, from whence I had but six days' by water 
to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of 
shipping, either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. 

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter 
would, have been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, 
the Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get 
passage ; and to go by land in those countries, was 
far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars ; likewise 
to Archangel, in October all the ships would be gone 
from thence, and even the merchants who dwell 
there in summer, retire south to Moscow in the 
winter, when the ships are gone; so that I should 
have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, 
with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in 
an empty town all the winter: so that, upon the 
whole, I thought it much my. better way to let the 
caravan go, and to make provision to winter where I 



358 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

was, viz., at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of 
sixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to 
wear out a ^old winter with, viz., plenty of provisions, 
such as the country aflforded, a warm house, with fuel 
enough, and Excellent company ; of all which I shall 
give a full account in its place. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my 
beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when 
I had my ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do 
to bear my clothes on my back/and never made any 
fire but without doors, for my necessity, in dressing ' 
my food, &c Now I made me three good vests, with 
large robes or gowns over them to hang down to 
the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all 
these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently 
warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly 
dislike our way in England, of making fires in every 
room in the house, in open chimne)rs, which, when 
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room 
cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in a 
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be 
built like a furnace, in the centre of six several 
rooms, like a stove ; the funnel to carry the smoke 
went up one way, the door to coime at the fire went 
in another, and all the rooms were kept equally 
warm, but no fire seen ; like as they heat the bagnios 
in England. 

By this means we had always the same climate in 
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and 
how cold soever it was withouti it was always warm 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 339 

within ; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incom- 
moded with any smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should 
be possible to meet with good company here in a 
country so barbarous as that of the most northerly 
part of Europe, near the Frozen ocean, and within 
but a very few degrees of Novi Zetnbla, 

But this being the country where the State 
criminals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all 
banished ; this city was full of noblemen, princes, 
gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all d^rees of 
the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of 
Muscovy: here were the famous prince Galliffken, 
or Gatoflfken, and hia son; the old general Robos- 
tisky, and several other persons of note, and some 
ladies.

CONVERSATIONS WITH A RUSSIAN GRANDEE — SET OUT ON 
MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS — HARASSED BY KALMUCKS 
ON THE ROAD — ARRIVAL AT ARCHANGEL — SAIL FROM 
THENCEy AND ARRIVE SAFELY IN ENGLAND. 

By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe- 
less, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance 
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them 
of the first rank : and from these, in the long winter 
nights in which I stayed here, I received several 
agreeable visits. It was talking one night with a 
certain prince, one of the banished ministers of state 
belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my talk of 
my particular case began. He had been telling me 
abundance of fine things, of the greatness, the magni- 
ficence, and dominions, and the absolute power of 
the Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted him, 
and told him I was a greater and more powerful 
prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy was, though 
my dominions were not so large, or my people so 
many. The Russian grandee looked a little sur- 
prised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began 
to wonder what I meant 

I told him his wonder would cease when I had

explained myself. First, I told him, I had the ab- 
solute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my 
subjects; that notwithstanding my absolute power, 
I had not one person disaffected to my government, 
or to my person, in all my dominions. He shook 
his head at that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the 
Czar of Muscovy. I told him that all the lands in 
my kingdom were my own, and all my subjects were 
not only my tenants, but tenants at will ; that they 
would all fight for me to the last drop; and that 
never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to be, 
was ever so universally beloved, and yet so horribly 
feared by his subjects. 

After amusing them with these riddles in govern- 
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told them 
the story at large of my living in the island, and 
how I managed both myself and the people there 
that were under me, just as I have since minuted 
it down. They were exceedingly taken with the 
story, and especially the prince, who told me with 
a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be 
master of ourselves ; that he would not have changed 
such a state of life as mine to have been Czar of 
Muscovy ; and that he found more felicity in the 
retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than 
ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed 
in the court of his master the Czar; that the height 
of human >visdom was to bring our tempers down 
to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, 
under the weight of the greatest storm without. 
When he came first hither, he said, he used to tear 



363 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the hair from his head, and the clothes from his 
baclr, as others had done before him; but a little 
time and consideration had made him look into him- 
self, as well as round himself, to things without ; 
that! he found the mind of man, if it was but once 
brought to reflect upon the state of universal life, 
and how little this world was concerned in its true 
felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity 
for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its 
own best ends and desires, with but very little as- 
sistance from the world ; that air to breathe in, food 
to sustain IHe, clothes for warmth, and liberty for 
exercise, in order to health, completed, ilt his opinion, 
all that the world could do for us; and though the 
greatness, the authority, the riches, and the pleasures 
which some enjoyed in the world, and which he had 
enjoyed his share of, had much in them that Was 
agreeable to us, yet he observed that all those 
things chiefly gratified the coarsest of our affections; 
such as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, 
our vanity, and our sensuality; all which were, in- 
deed, the mere product of the worst part of man, 
were in themselves crimes, and had in them the seeds 
of all manner of crimes; but neither were related to 
or cottcemed with, any of those virtues that consti- 
tuted us wise men, or of those graces which distin- 
guished us as Christians ; that being now deprived of 
all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full 
exercise of all those vices, he said be was at leisure 
to look upon the dark side of them, where he found 
all manner of deformity; and was now convinced that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 363 

Virtue ohly makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, 
and preserves him in the way to a superior hslppiness 
in a future state ; and in this, he said, they were more 
happy in their banishment than all their enemies were, 
who had the full possession of all the wealth and 
power that they (the banished) had left behind them* 

•*Nor, sir," said he, "do I bringf my mind to this 
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances, 
which some call miserable ; but if I know anything 
of myself, I would not go back, no, not though my 
tnaster the Czar should call me, and offer to ran- 
state me in all my former grandeur ; I say, I would 
no more go back to it thart I believe my soul, when 
it shall be delivered from this prison of the body and 
has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, 
would come back to the goal of fl^sh and blood it is 
now enclosed in, and leave Heaven to deal in the 
dirt and grime of human affairs." 

He spake this with so much warmth in his temper, 
so much earnestness and motion of his spHrits, which 
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident 
it was the true sense of his soul ; and indeed there 
was no room to doubt his sincerity. 

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a 
monarch in my old station, of which I had gfiven him 
an account, but that I thought he was not a monarch 
only, but a great conqueror; for that he that has got 
a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has 
the absolute dominion over himself, and whose reason 
entirely governs his will, is certainly greater than he 
that conquers a city. 



364 THE LIFE AND ADVENTUfiES 

"But, my lord," said I, "shall I take the liberty to 
ask you a question ? " 

•' With all my heart," said he. 

" If the door of your liberty was opened," said I, 
^* would not you take hold of it to deliver yourself 
from this exile ? " 

"Hold," said he, "your question is subtle, and 
requires some serious just distinctions to give it a 
sincere answer; and I'll give it you from the bottom 
of my heart. Nothing that I know of in this world 
would move me to deliver myself from the state of 
banishment, except these two : first, the enjoyment 
of my relations ; and secondly, a little warmer clrmate. 
But I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp 
of the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a 
minister of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and the 
pleasures, that is to say, follies of a courtier; if my 
master should send me word this moment that he 
restores me to all he banished me from, I protest, if 
I know myself at all, I would not leave this wilder- 
ness, these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the 
palace of Moscow." 

"But, my lord," said I, "perhaps you not only are 
banished from the pleasures of the court, and from 
the power, and authority, and wealth you enjoyed 
before, but you may be absent too from some of the 
conveniences of life ; your estate perhaps confiscated, 
and your effects plundered ; and the supplies left you 
here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of 
life." 

" Ay," said he, " that is, as you suppose me to be a 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 36s 

lord, or a prince, &c So indeed I am ; but you are 
now to consider me only as a man, a human creature, 
not at all distinguished from another; and so I can 
suffer no want, unless I should be visited with sick- 
ness and distempers. However, to put the question 
out of dispute ; you see our manner; we are in this 
place five persons of rank ; we live perfectly retired, 
as suited to a state of banishment : we have some- 
thing rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes, 
which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting 
for our food; but the poor soldiers who are here, 
.without that help, live in as much plenty as we. 
They go into the woods and catch sables and foxes ; 
the labour of a month will maintain them a year; 
and as the.way of living is not expensive, so it is not 
hard to get sufficient to ourselves; so that objection 
is out of doors." 

I have no room to give a full account of the most 
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great 
man ; in all which he showed, that his mind was so 
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so 
supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of 
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really as 
much as he had expressed, and that he was always 
the same to the last, as will appear in the story I am 
going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful 
winter I thought it to be. The cold was so intense * 
that I could not so much as look abroad without 
being wrapt in furs, and a mask of fur before my 
face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, 



366 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

aad two for sight. The little daylight we bad was, 
as we reckoned, for three na oaths, not above five hours 
a day, or six at most ; only that snow lying on the 
ground continually, and the weather being clear, it 
was never quite dark. Our horses were kept (or 
rather starved) under ground ; and as for our ser- 
vants (for we hired servants here to look after our 
horses and ourselves), we had every now and then 
their fingers and toes to thaw, and take care of, lest 
they should mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses 
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the 
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of 
deer, dried and cured in the season ; good bread 
enough, but baked as biscuits ; dried fish of several 
sorts, and some flesh pf mutton, and of buffaloe3; 
which is pretty good beef. All the stores of pro- 
vision for the winter are laid up in the summer, and 
well cured. Our drink was water mixed with aqua- 
vitae instead of brandy ; and for a treat, mead instead 
of wine ; which, however, they have excellent good. 
The hunters, who , ventured abroad all weathers, 
frequently brought us in fresh venison, very fat and 
good; and sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not 
much care for the last We bad a good stock of tea, 
' with which we treated our friends as above; and, in 
a word, we lived very cheerfully and well, all things 
considered. 

It was now March, and the days grown consider- 
ably longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so 
oth^r travellers began to prepare sledges to carry 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 367 

them over the snow, and to get things ready to be 
going: but my measures being fixed,. as I have said, 
for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I 
made no motion, knowing very well that the ships 
from the south do not set out for that part of the 
world till Mayor June; and that if I was thereat 
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any 
ships would be ready to go away; and therefore, I 
say, I made no haste to be gone, as others did ; in a 
word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the travel- 
lers, go away before me. It seems, every year they 
go from thence to Moscow for trade; viz., to carry 
furs, and buy necessaries with them, which they bring 
back to furnish their shops ; also others went on the 
same errand to Archangel ; but then they also, being 
to come back again above eight hundred miles, went 
all out before me. 

In short, about the latter end of May I began to 
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, 
it occurred to me, that seeing all these people were 
banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and 
yet, when they came there, were at liberty to go 
whither they would ; why did they not then go away 
to any part of the world wherever they thought fit ? 
and I began to examine what should hinder them 
from making such an attempt 

But my wonder was over when I entered upon 
that subject with the person I have mentioned^ who 
answered me thus : " Consider first," said be, " the 
place where we are ; and, secondly, the condition we 
are in ; especially," said he, " the generality <rf the 



368 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

people who are banished hither. We are surrounded * 
said he, " with stronger things than bars and bolts : 
on the north side is an unnavigable ocean, where ship 
never sailed, and boat never swam ; neither, if we had 
both, could we know whither to go with them. Every 
other way," said he, " we have above a thousand miles 
to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and by 
ways utterly impassable, except by the roads made 
by the government, and through the towns garrisoned 
by its troops ; so that we could neither pass undis- 
covered by the road, or subsist any other way; so 
that it is in vain to attempt it" 

I was silenced indeed, at once, and found that 
they were in a prison, every jot as secure as if they 
had been locked up in the castle of Moscow; how- 
ever, it came into my thoughts that I might certainly 
be made an instrument to procure the escape of this 
excellent person, and that it was very easy for me 
to carry him away, there being no guard over him 
in the country, and- as I was not going to Moscow, 
but to Archangel, and that I went in the nature of 
a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the 
stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp 
every night where I would, we might easily pass 
uninterrupted to Archangel, where I could imme- 
diately secure him on board an English or Dutch 
ship, and carry him off safe along with me ; and as 
to his subsistence and other particulars, that should 
be my care, till he should better supply himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly 
on me all the while I spoke ; nay, I could see in hts 



' OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 369 

very face, that what I said put his spirits into an ex- 
ceeding ferment ; his colour frequently changed, his 
eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might 
be even perceived in his countenance ; nor could he 
immediately answer me when I had done, and as it 
\irere expected what he would say to it, and after he 
had paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How 
unhappy are we, unguided creatures as we are, that 
even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares 
to us, and we are made tempters of one another! 
My dear friend," said he, " your offer is so sincere, 
has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, 
and is so calculated for my advantage, that I must 
have very little knowledge of the world, if I did not 
both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I 
have upon me to you for it : but did you believe I 
was sincere in what I have so often said to you of 
my contempt of the world? Did you believe I 
spoke my very soul to you, and that I had really 
maintained that degree of felicity here, that had 
placed me above all that the world could give me, 
or do for me ? Did you believe I was sincere when 
I told you I would not go back, if I was recalled even 
to be all that once I was in the court, and with the 
favour of the Czar my master ? Did you believe me, 
my friend, to be an honest man, or did you think me 
to be a boasting hypocrite ? " Here he stopped, as 
if he would hear what I would say; but indeed I 
soon after perceived that he stopped because his 
spirits were in motion; his heart was full of struggles, 

and he could not go on. I was, I confess, astonished

at the thing, as well as at the mac, and I used some 
arguments with him to ui^e him to set himself free ; 
that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by 
Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Provi- 
dence, who has the care and good disposition of all 
events, to do himself good, and to render himself 
useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself. " How do 
you know, sir," said he warmly, "but that, instead 
of a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint of 
another instrument, representing, in all the alluring 
colours to me, the show of felicity as a deliverance, 
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly 
to my ruin ? Here I am free from the temptation of 
returning to my former miserable greatness ; there I 
am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, ambition, 
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my 
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word, 
again overwhelm me ; and then the happy prisoner, 
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall 
be the miserable slave of his own senses, in the full 
possession of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me 
remain in this blessed confinement, banished from 
the crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of 
freedom at the expense of the liberty of my reason, 
and at the expense of the future happiness which 
now I have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quickly 
lose sight of; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere man, 
have passions and afiections as likely to possess and 
overthrow me as any man : Oh, be not my friend and 
my tempter both together I "

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, 
and stood silent, looking at him ; and indeed admired 
what I saw. The struggle in his soul was so great, 
that though the weather was extremely cold, it put 
him into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanted 
to give vent to his mind ; so I said a word or two, 
that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on 
him again ; and then I withdrew to my own apart- 
ment. 

About two hours after I heard somebody at or 
near the door of the room, and I was going to open 
the door; but he had opened it, and come in : 

" My dear friend," said he, you had almost overset 
me, but I am recovered : do not take it ill that I do 
not close with your oflTcr; I assure you, it is not for 
want of a sense of the kindness of it in you ; and I 
come to make the most sincere acknowledgment of 
it to you ; but I hope I have got the victory over 
myself" 

" My lord," said I, " I hope you are fully satisfied 
that you did not resist the call of Heaven." 

"Sir," said he, "if it had been from Heaven, the 
same power would have influenced me to accept it; 
but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from 
Heaven that I decline it ; and I have an infinite satis- 
faction in the parting, that you shall leave me an 
honest man still, though not a free man." 

I liad nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make 
profession to him of my having no end in it, but a 
sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very 
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of that, 



372 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and should always acknowledge it ; and with that he 
offered me a very fine present of sables, too much 
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum- 
stances: and I would have avoided them^ but he 
would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to^his lord- 
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of China 
damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which 
did not all weigh above six ounces, or thereabouts ; 
but were far short of the value of his sables, which 
indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near 
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one 
piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of gold, 
which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, 
which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would 
not take any more; and sent word by my servant 
that he desired to speak with me. 

When I came to him he told me I knew what had 
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him 
any more in that affair; but that since I made such 
a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had kind- 
ness enough to offer the same to another person that 
he would name to me, in whom he had a great share 
of concern. I told him that I could not say I in- 
clined to do so much for any one but himself, for 
whom I had a particular value, and should have been 
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance : 
however, if he would please to name the person to 
me, I would give him my answer, and hoped he 
would not be displeased with me, if he was with my 
answer. He told me it was only his son, who. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. yjl 

though I had not seen, yet was in the same condition 
with himself, and above two hundred miles from him, 
on the other side the Oby, but that if I consented, 
he would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. 
I made some ceremony in letting him understand 
that it was wholly on his account ; and that seeing 
I could not prevail on him, I would show my respect 
to him by my concern for his son : but these things 
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the 
next day for his son, and in about twenty days he 
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the 
whole, amounted to a very great value. 

His servants brought the horses into the town, 
but left the young lord at a distance till night, when 
he came incognito into our apartment, and his father 
presented him to me ; and, in short, we concerted 
there the manner of our travelling, and everything 
proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, 
black fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs 
that are very rich ; I say I had bought them in 
that city for exchange for some of the goods 
brought from China ; in particular for the cloves 
and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part 
here; and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a 
much better price than I could have done at Lon- 
don; and my partner, who was sensible of the 
profit, and whose business, more particularly than 
mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased 



374 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

with our stay, on account of the traffic we made 
here. 

It was in the beginning of June when I left this 
remote place, a city, I beh'eve, little heard of in the 
world ; and indeed it is so far out of the road of 
commerce, that I know not how it should be much 
talked of. We were now come to a very small 
caravan, being only thirty-two horses and camels 
in all, and all of them passed for mine, though my 
new guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was 
most natural also, that I should take more servants 
with me than I had before, and the young lord 
passed for my steward; what great man I passed 
for myself I know not, neither did it concern me to 
inquire. We had here the worst -and the largest 
desert to pass over that we met with in all the 
journey ; indeed I call it the worst, because the way 
was very deep in some places, and very uneven in 
others ; the best we had to say for it was, that we 
thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers to 
fear, and that they never came on this side the river 
Oby, or at least but very seldom ; but we found it 
otherwise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite 
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per- 
fectly acquainted with the country ; and who led us 
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the 
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such 
as Tumen, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others: 
because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept 
there, are very curious and strict in their observation 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. yj^ 

upon travellers, and searching lest any of the banished 
persons of note should make their escape that way 
into Muscovy ; but by this means as we were kept 
out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, 
and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents^ 
when we might have had good accommodation in the 
cities on the way ; this the young lord was so sensible 
of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when we 
came to several cities on the way; but lay abroad 
himself, with his servant, in the woods, and met us 
always at the appointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the 
river Kama, which in these parts is the boundary 
between Europe and Asia ; and the first city on the 
European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, which is 
as much as to say, the great city on the river Kama 
and here we thought to have seen some evident 
alteration in the people, their manners, their habit, 
their religion, andtheir business ; but we were mis- 
taken ; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which by 
relation is near seven hundred miles long in some 
places, but not above two hundred miles over where 
we passed it; so, till we came past that horrible place, 
we found very little difference between that country 
and the Mogul Tartary ; the people mostly Pagans, 
and little better than the savages of America ; their 
h6uses and towns full of idols, and their way of living 
wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above, and 
the villages near them ; where they are Christians, as 
they call themselves, of the Greek Church ; but even 
these have their religion mingled with so many relics 



376 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some 
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must, 
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, es- 
caped, as before, have been plundered and robbed, 
and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves: of 
what country they were, whether the roving bands 
of the Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people 
on the banks of the Oby, had ranged thus far ; or 
whether they were the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am 
yet at a loss to know ; but they were all on horse- 
back, carried bows and arrows, and were at first 
about five-and-forty in number. They came so 
near to us as within about two musket shot; and 
asking no questions, they surrounded us with their 
horses, and looked very earnestly upon us twice. 
At length they placed themselves just in our way ; 
upon which we drew up in a little line before our 
camels, being not above sixteen men in all; and 
being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the 
Siberian servant who attended his lord, to see who 
they were : his master was the more willing to let 
him go, because he was not a little apprehensive that 
they were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The 
man came up near them with a flag of truce, and 
called to them ; but though he spoke several of their 
languages, or dialects of languages rather, he could 
not understand a word they said ; however, after some 
signs to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, 
so he said he understood them to mean, offering to 
shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back no

wiser than he went, only that by their dress he said 
he believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or 
of the Circassian hordes ; an'd that there must be 
more of them on the great desert, though he never 
heard that ever any of them were seen so far north 
before. 

This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no 
remedy: there was on our left hand, at about a 
quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump 
of trees, which stood close together, and very near 
the road ; I immediately resolved we should advance 
to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we 
could there; for, first, I considered that the trees 
would in a great measure cover us from their arrows ; 
and in the next place, they could not come to charge 
us in a body : it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot 
who proposed it ; and who had this excellency attend- 
ing him, namely, that he was always readiest and 
most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of 
the most danger. We advanced immediately with 
what speed we could, and gained that little wood, 
the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what to call 
them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to 
hinder us. 

When we came thither, we found to our great satis- 
faction, that it was a swampy, springy piece of ground, 
and on the other side a great spring of water which, 
running out in a little rill or brook, was, a little fur- 
ther, joined by another of the like bigness ; and was, 
in short, the head or source of a considerable river, 
called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which grew 



378 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

about this spring were not in all above two hundred, 
but were very large, and stood pretty thick : so that 
as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves perfectly safe 
from the enemy, unless they alighted and attacked 
us on foot 

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, 
with indefatigable application, cut down great arms 
of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite 
off, from one tree to another ; so that he made a 
continued fence almost round us. 

We stayed here, waiting the motion of the enemy 
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer 
to stir ; when about two hours before night they 
came down directly upon us; and though we had 
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by 
some more of the same, so that they were near four- 
score horse, whereof, however, we fancied some were 
women. They came on till they were within half a 
shot of our little wood, when we fired one musket 
without ball, and called to them in the Russian 
tongue to know what they wanted, and bid them 
keep off; but as if they knew nothing of what we 
said, they came on with a double fury directly up 
to the wood side, not imagining we were so bar- 
ricaded, that they could not break in. Our old pilot 
was our captain, as well as he had been our engineer; 
and desired of us not to fire upon them till they 
came within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to 
kill ; and that when we did fire, we should be sure 
to take good aim. We bade him give the word of 
command ; which he delayed so long, that they were, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 379 

some of them, within two pikes' length of us when 
we fired. 

We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot 
so sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the first 
volley, and wounded several others, as also several 
of their horses ; for we had all of us loaded our pieces 
with two or three bullets apiece at least. 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and 
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from 
us ; in which time we loaded our pieces again, and 
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and 
caught four or five of their horses, whose riders, we 
supposed, were killed ; and coming up to the dead, 
we could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew 
not from what country, or how they came to make 
an excursion such an unusual length. 

About an hour after they made a motion to attack 
us again, and rode round our little wood, to see where 
else they might break in ; but finding us always ready 
to face them, they went oflf again, and we resolved 
not to stir from the place for that night. 

We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the 
most part of the night in strengthening our situation, 
and barricading the entrances into the wood; and 
keeping a strict watch, we waited for daylight, and 
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery 
indeed: for the enemy, who we thought were dis- 
couraged with the reception they had met with, were 
now increased to no less than three hundred, and 
had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents, as if they 
were resolved to besiege us : and this little camp they 



38o THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

had pitched was upon the open plain, at about three 
quarters of a mile from us. We were indeed sur- 
prised at this discovery ; and now, I confess, I gave 
myself over for lost, and all that I had. The loss of 
my effects did not lie so near me (though they were 
very considerable) as the thoughts of falling into the 
hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my 
journey, after so many difficulties and hazards as I 
had gone through ; and even in sight of our port, 
where we expected safety and deliverance. As for 
my partner, he was raging: he declared that to lose 
his goods would be his ruin ; and he would rather die 
than be starved ; and he was for fighting to the last 
drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed 
itself, was for fighting to the last also ; and my old 
pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them 
all, in the situation we then were in: and thus we 
spent the day in debates of what we should do ; but 
towards evening we found that the number of our 
enemies still increased ; perhaps as they were abroad 
in several parties for prey, the first had sent out 
scouts to call for help, and to acquaint them of their 
booty; and we did not know but by the morning 
they might still be a greater number ; so I began to 
inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolski, 
if there were no other, or more private ways, by which 
we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps either 
retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over 
the desert. . 

The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 381 

told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, 
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a way 
that went north towards the river Petraz, by which 
he made no doubt but we might get away, and the 
Tartars never the wiser: but he said his lord had 
told him he would not return, but would rather 
choose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord; 
for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for 
the sake of it ; that I knew his lord was brave enough 
by what he had showed already ; but that his lord 
knew better than to desire to have seventeen or eigh- 
teen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable 
necessity forced them to it ; and that if he thought 
it possible for us to escape in the night, we had 
nothing else to do but to attempt it He answered^ 
if his lord gave him such order, he would lose his life 
if he did not perform it. We soon brought his lord 
to give that order, though privately, and we imme 
diately prepared for the putting it in practice. 

And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we 
kindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept burn- 
ing, and prepared so as to make it burn all night, 
that the Tartars might conclude we were still there ; 
but as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we 
could see the stars (for our guide would not stir 
before), having all our horses and camels ready 
loaded, we followed our new guide, who, I soon found, 
steered himself by the pole or north star, all the 
country being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter still ; not that it was quite dark 



382 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

all night, but the moon began to rise ; so that, in 
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be : 
but by six o'clock next morning we were gotten near 
forty miles, though the truth is, we almost spoiled 
our horses. Here we found a Russian village, named 
Kirmazinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing 
of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours 
before night we set out again, and travelled till 
eight the next morning, though not quite so hastily 
as before ; and about seven o'clock we passed a little 
river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large town 
inhabited by Russians, and very populous, called 
Ozomys. There we heard that several troops or 
herds of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, 
but that we were now completely out of danger of 
them, which was to our great satisfaction, you may 
be sure. Here we were obliged to get some fresh 
horses, and having need enough of rest, we stayed 
five days ; and my partner and I agreed to g^ve the 
honest Siberian who brought us hither the value of 
ten pistoles for his conducting us. 

In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the 
river Witzogda, which, running into the river Dwina, 
we were there very happily near the end of our travels 
by land, that river being navigable in seven days' pas- 
sage to Archangel. From hence we came to Law- 
renskoy, where the river joins, the third of July; 
and provided ourselves with two luggage-boats and 
a barge for our convenience. We embarked the 
seventh, and arrived all safe at Archangel the eigh- 
teenth, having been a year^ five months, and three 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 383 

days on the journey, includingr cur stay of eight 
months and odd days at Tobolsk!. 

We were obliged to stay at this place six week^ 
for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried 
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above a 
month sooner than any of the English ships ; when, 
after some consideration that the city of Hamburgh 
might happen to be as good a market for our goods 
as London, we all took freight with him ; and having 
put our goods on board, it was most natural for me 
to put my steward on board to take care of them, 
by which means my young lord had a sufficient 
opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on 
shore again in all the time we stayed there ; and 
this he did, that he might not be seen in the city, 
where some of the Moscow merchants would cer- 
tainly have seen and discovered him. 

We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of August 
the same year, and after no extraordinary bad voy- 
age, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of September. 
Here my partner and I found a very good sale for 
our goods, as well those of China, as the sables, &c., 
of Siberia ; and dividing the produce of our effects, 
my share amounted to ;£^347S, 17^. 3^.| notwithstand- 
ing so many losses we had sustained, and charges we 
had been at ; only remembering that I had included 
in this about £6oQ worth of diamonds, which I had 
purchased at Bengal 

Here the young lord took his leave of us and 
went up to the Elbe, in order to go to the court of 
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and

where he could correspond with those of his father's 
friends who were left alive. He did not part with- 
out all the testimonies he could give of gratitude 
for the service I had done him, and his sense of my 
kindness to the prince his father. 

To conclude, having stayed near four months 
in Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to 
the Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and 
arrived in London the tenth of January 1705, 
having been gone from England ten years and nine 
months. 

And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I 
am preparing for a longer journey than all these, 
having lived seventy-two years a life of infinite 
variety, and learnt sufficiently to know the value of 
retirement, and the blessing of ending our days in 
peace. 



THE END.
