'TPHAT homely proverb, ufed on fo many occafion*

will not go out of the flefh, was never more verified than 
in the ftory of my lifb.— Any on^ would think, that

happy circumftancefy which few men, if ever any, went 
through before ; and aftei* near feven years of peace and

when, if ever it might be allowed me to have had ex- 
perience of every ftate of middle life, and to know which 
was moft adapted to make a man completely happy ; I

satlve prppcafity to rambling, which I gave an account 
of in my firft fettang out into the world, to have been fo 
predominant in my thoughts, 4hoald be ymrn out, the 
volati^ part be fully evaporated, or at ieaft condenfed*

fan4pounds> I had been no richer; for I had dready; 
tufiicient for me, and for thofe I had to leave it to ; and 
that 1 had was viiibly increaflng ; for having no great 
feitiily, Icoold not fpend the income of what I hadj 
unlefs I would fet up for an expeniive way of living>^ 
fuch as a great family, ftrvants, equipage, gaiety, and 
the like, which were things I had no notion of, or incli- 
nation to; fo that I had nothing indeed to do, but to fit 
itill, and fully enjoy what I had got, and fte itincreafe 
daily upon my hands. 

Yet all thefe things had no elFedl upon me, or at lead 
not enough to rcfift the itrong inclination I had to go 
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical dif- 
ftcj3ciper ; ^particularly the dcfirc of feeing my new plan- 
tation in the iiland, and the colony I left there, tun in 
my head continu^illy. — I dreamed of it all night, and. 
my imagination ran upon it all day ; it was uppermoft^ 
in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked fo Headily 
'and ftrongly upon it, that I talked of it in my Heep j. 
in fhort, nothing could remove it out of my mind.— It 
even broke fo violently into all my difcourfes, that it,, 
made my coiiverratio» tirefome ; for I c»>uld talk of no- 
thing el fe; all my difcourfcTan into it, even to im- 
pertinence ; and I faw it myfelf. 

I havve often heard perfons of good judgment fay, that 
all the iVir people make in the workl^about ghoils and; 
apparitions, is owing to the llrength of imagination, 
and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds ^, 
that there is no fuch thing. a« a fpirit ai5pearing, or a 
ghoft walking, and the like : That people's poring affec- 
tionately upon the paH^onverfation of their deceas'd 
friends, fo realizes it to lhem,^that they are capable of 
fancying, upon fom« extraordinary circumftances, that 
they fee them, talk to them, and are anfwered by them ; ^ 
when, in ti-oth, there is nothing but fhadow and vapour 
in the thing,and they really know nothing of the matter. 
For my part, I know not to this hour, whether 
there are any fuch things as real apparitions, fpe^es* 
or walking of people after they are dead> or whether 
there is any thing in the ilories they tell us of that kind> 
more than the produdt of vapours, fick minds, and 
Hr^dmng fan^ies.-^But this I know^ Uiat my imagina-

tion worked me ap to fach a height, and broaght me into 
fuch excefs of vapours, or what elfe I may call it, that 
I adually fuppofed myfelf oftentimes upon the fpot, at 
my old caille behind the trees ; I faw my old Spaniard, 
Friday's father, and the reprobate Tailors, whom I lefc 
upon the ifland. — Nay, I fancied I talked with them, and 
looked at them fo fleadily, tho' I was broad awake, as 
at perfons jufl before me ; and this I did till I often ^ 
frightened myfelf with the images my fancy reprefented * 
to me. — One time, in my flcep, I had the villainy of 
the three pirate failors io lively related to me by the 
£r(l Spaniard and Friday's father, that it was furprifing ; 
they told jne how they barbaroufly attempted to murder 
all the Spaniards, and that they fet fire to the proviiions 
the yhad laid -up, on purpofe to diHrefs and flarve them ; 
things that I had never heard of, and yet they were all 
of them true in fad ; and it was fo warm in my ima- 
gination, and fo realized to me, th^t to the hour I 
faw them, I could not be perfuaded t)Ut that it was, or 
would be true ; alfo how f refenxed it, when the Spa- 
niards complained to me ; and how I brought them to 
jailice* tried them before me, and ordered them all three 
to be hanged. — What there was really in all this fhall 
be feen in its place ; for however I came to form fuch 
•things in my dream, and what fecret converfe of fpirits 
injeSed it, yet there was, I fay, very much of it true. 
J own that this dream had nothing in it literally and 
fpecifically true ;'but the general part was fo true, the 
bafe and villainous behaviour of thefe three hardened 
rogues was fuch, and had been fo much worfe than all I 
can defcribe, that the dream had too much fimilitude 
of the fad; and as I wodld afterwards have punifhed 
them feyerely, fo if 1 had hanged them all> t had beea 
much in the right, and ihould have been jufli£ed both 
by the laws of God and man. 

But to return to my ftory : in this kind of temper 
I had lived feme years ; 1 had no enjoyment :of my 
life, no pleaf ant . hours, no agreeable diveriion, but 
wha^ had fomeihing or other of this in it ; fo that my 
wife; who faw my mind fo wholly bent upon it, told 
^ jBkc vtry ferioufly one night, that (he b^V\eN^<\\.V^\^ ^"^^

whieh had determined me to go thidier again ; axid^diat 
(he found nothing hindered my going, but my being en- 
gaged to a wife and children. -^She told me, that it was 
true, (he could not think of parting with me ; but asihe 
was afTured, that if fhe was dead, it would be the iirfl 
thing I would do ; fo, as it feemed to her, that the thing 
was determined above, fhe would not be the only ob - 
ftru^ion ; for, if I thought fit, and refolvcd to gO ' ■ ■*■■ 
Here ihe found me very intent upon her words, and thit 
I looked very earneftly at her; fo that it a little difor- 
dered her, and fhe flopped. I aiked her why fhe did not 
go on, and fay out what fhe was going to fay. But I pet - 
ceived her heart was too full, and fome tears flood im 
}ier eye's. — Speak out, my dear, fays I ; arc you willing 
I ihould go ? No, fays fhe, vsry aiFe6Uonately> I am hr 
from willing ; but if you are refblved to go, fays fhe, 
rather than I will be the only hindrance, I will go w^th 
you ; for though I ^ink it a prepofterous ^ing for one 
of your years, and in your condition, yet if it muftbe, 
^ faid fhe again, weeping, I won't leave you ; for ii it be 
of heaven, you mufi do it, there is no refitting it— And 
if heaven makes it your duty to go, he will alfo make 
it mine to go with yoti, or otherwife difpofe of me, that 
I may not obflrud it. 

This aiFcftionate behaviour of my wife, brought me 
• a little out of the vapours, and I began to co'nfider whdt 
I was doing— ^I corrected my wandering fancy, and be^ 
gan to argue with myfelf fedately, what bufincfs I had, 
after three fcore years, and after fuch a life of tectious 
fufFerings and difaflers^ and cbfed in fo happy and eafy 
a manner, I fay, what bufinefs had I to rufh into new 
hazards, and pat myfelf upon adventures, fit only for 
youth and poverty to run into. 

With th<^e thoughts, I confidered my new engage- 
ments—that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife 
then great with child of another ; and that I had all the 
world could give me, and had no need to feek hazards 
for gain— »that 1 was declining in years, and ought to 
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of feek- 
ing to increafe it ; that as to what my wife had faid, of 
Jts being an impulfe from heaven, and that it fhould 
.be my duty to gOf I had no notion of xKax.*, Co after 



tOfttK^OK CfttlS^OE. ^ 

many of thefe cogitations, I ftruggled with the power 
of my imagination, reaibnod iiayfelf out of it, as I believe 
people may sihyays do in l^ike cafe»* if they will ; and, in 
a word, I conquered it : compofed myfelf with fuck argu- 
s^nt$ as oGCvured to my thoughts, and which my preient 
. condition fv railhed mc plentifully with ; and particnlacu 
4y, as the molt effisAoal method, I relolved to divert ray- 
^If v/ith other things,, and lo eagage in ibme ba£n^ 
^at might eife^tuaily tie me up from any more txcar*> 
fioas of this kind ; for I founa the thing returned upon 
me ci^fiAy when I was idle, had nothing to do» or any 
iking of monient immediatdly before me. 
• Tq this purpofe I bought a little farmia the county 
of Bedford,^ and refolded to remove myfelf thither. I had 
a little convenient houfe upoa it, and the land about it 
J found was capable of great improvemeat^ and that it 
was many ways fuited to mf inclination, which delighted 
in cultivating, managing^ Ranting, and improving of 
land ; and parliicitlflriy, being an inland couaty, I was 
removed ^m converfing among ihipa, failors, and 
i^ngs relating to the remoitse parts of the world. 

In a word^ I went down to ay farm, fettled my fa-* 
mily, bought flae ploughs, harrows^ a cart, waggcmi^ 
horfes, cows, (heep ; and, letting feriouily to work> 
became in one half year a mere coantry gentleman ; 
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my 
^rvants, cultivating the. ground, indofing, plantings 
&c, and I lived, as I thought, the moft agreeable life 
that nature was capable ^ dire^ing, or that a man 
always bred to misibrtanes, was capable of being rc-« 
-treated to. 

I farmed upon my own land, I. had no rent to pay, 

was limited by no articles; I could pull up, or cut 

down, as I pleafed ; what I planted was for myfelf $ 

and what I improved was< for my family ; and having 

tjius left off the thoughts of wandering, I hgd not 

'^the leail difcomfort in any part of ray life, as to this 

world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoyed that 

middle flate qf li£s^ which my father fo earneftly re* 

commended to me : a kind of heavenly life, fbme thing

the wandering difpofitiony which, as I may fay, being

and, like the returns of a violent diflemper, came on ; 
with an irrefiftlble Ibrce upon me ; fb that nothing could j 
make any more impreflion upon me. . Thii blow was 
the lofs of my wife.

guide my. rambling genius^ tjian a mother's tears, a 
Other's infbuitions, a friend's counfel, or all my own

circulation of forrow, living but to work, and working 
but to live ; as if daily bread were the only end of a 
wearifbme life, and a wearifome life the only occafion 
of daily bread. .... 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my king* 
domy the iiland ; where I fuffered no more corn to grow^ 
becaufe 1 did not want it ; and bred no more goats^ be- 
caufe I had no more ufe for them : where the money 
lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed, and had fcarce 
the favor to be looked upon in 20 years. 

All thefe things, had I improved them as I ought to 
hkve done, and as reafon and religion had dictated to 
me, would have taught me to fearch further than human 
enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there was fome- 
thing which certainly was the reafon and end of life, 
fuperior to all 'thefe things, which was either to be pof« 
fe^ed, or at leail hoped for on this iide the ^ave. 

But my fage counfellor was gone; I was like a (hip 
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind : my 
thoughts run all away again into the old affair,, my 
head was quite turned with the whimfies of foreign 
adventures ; and all the pleaiing innocent amufements 
of my farm,, and my garden, my cattle and my family, . 
which before entirely poiTeffcd-me, were nothing to me, 
had no relifh, and were like mufic to one t^ac has no ear, ,

a (hip, was come home, from a ihort voyage to fiilboa, 
being the itril he had made ; he came to me, and tM 
me^ that fome merchants oF his acquaintance had been 
propofing to him to go a voyage for them to the £aft- 
Indi«s apd to Chtna^ as private traders : And now, uncle, 
fays, he^if yoa will go to iea with me, I'll engage to IsLud, 
you upon your old habitation in the ifland« for we are to 
touch at the Brafils. 

Nothing can be a greater demonftration of a future 
ftate, and of the exiftence of an invifible world, than 
the concurrence of fecond .caufes with the ideas of 
things, which we form in our minds, perfe^ly referved, 
find not commnnicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my diftemper of 
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of 
what he h#d in his thoughts to fay ; when that very 
morning before he came to me, I had* in a great deal of 
confufion of thought, and revolving every part of my 
^ circumftances in my mind, come to this reibiution, viz. 
that I would go to Lifbon, and coniult with my old Tea- 
captain, and To, if it was rational and pra^cable, £ 
would go and iee the ifland again, and fee what was be^ 
come of my people there. I had plcafcd my felf alfo with 
the thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inha- 
bitants from hence, getting a patent for the poffeffion, 
and I know not what ; when in the middle of all this, in 
comes my nephew, as I have faid, with his proje£l*of 
carrying me thither, in his way to the Eaft-Indie&. 

I paufed a while at his words, and looking iieadily at 
him. What devil, faid I, fent yon on this unlucky er« 
rand ? My nephew ftartled, as if he had been frighted 
at firil J but perceiving 1 was not much difpleafed with 
the propofal, he recovered himfelf : I hope it may not be 
an unlucky propofal, fir, faysjhe ; I dare fay you would 
be pleafed to fee your new coipny there, where you once 
reigned with more felicity wan moft of your brother 
monarchs in the world. 

In a word, the fcheme hit (o exaftly with my tem- 

> per, that is to fay, with the prepoffeffion I was under, 

and of which I have faid fo much, that I told him in 

i^fF words, if he agreed with the merchants, I would 



S^OBINSOK CRtrsOE. sj 

go with liin : but I told him, I would not pfomife to g6 
any farther than «y own iflattd. Why, Sir; fays he, you 
doni't want to be left there a^ain, I ^ope ? .Why, faid F^ 
can yos not take n^e up agap in your retorn ? He told 
mte it would not be po^ble to do fo ; that the merchants 
wonld never allow him to come that way with a loaden 
fliip ofibch value, it being a month's fail out of his way^ 
and might be three or fom- : Befides, Sir, if I (hould mif- 
carry» faid he, and iK>t return at all, then you would be 
jull reduced to the condition you were in before. 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a 
remedy ibr it, which was to carry a framed (loop on 
board the ihip,. which, being taken in pieces ^ and 
fhipped on board the (hip, might, by the help of fome 
«€arpentew, whom we agreed to carry with us, be fet up 
again in the ifland, and &ni(hed, fit to go to fea in a few 
days. 

I was not long reiblving; for indeed the importuni^ 
ties of my nephew, joined in fo^fFedually with my in- 
clinaiion, that nothing could oppofe me ; on the other 
hand, my wife being dead, 1 had nobody that concern-* 
ed themfelves fo much for me, as to perfuade me one 
way or other, except my ancient good friend the wi- 
dow, vt^o earneltly druggled with me to coniider my 
years, my eafy circumftances, and the needlefs hazard 
of a long voyage ; and, above all, ray young children : 
but it wa^ all to no purpofe, I had an irrefiSible defire 
to go the voyage ; and I told her, I thought there was 
fomething fo uncommon in theimpreffions I had upon 
my mind ibr ^the voyage, that it would be a kind of 
refifting Providence, if I (hould attempt to day at home; 
after which flie ceafed her expoflulations, and joined 
with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, 
but alfoin fettling my family-affairs in my abfence, and 
providing for the education of my children. 
. In order to this, I made my will, and fettled the 
eflate 1 had in inch a manner for my children, and 
placed it in fach hand^, that I was perfedly eaiy and 
^tisfied they would have juflice done them, whatever 
might be^ me ; and for their education, I left it

no mother could have taken more care in^ their edaca^

konie, I alfo lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to fail about the beginning 
of January, 1694-5, and I, with my man Friday, went 
on board in the Downs the. 8th, having, befides that 
iloop which I mentioned above, a very . confiderable 
-cargo of all kinds, of neceflary things for my colony, 
which if I did not find in good condition, I refolved to 
leave fo. 

Firft, I carried with me fome fervants, whom I : 
p^urpofed to place there, as inhabitants, or at leaft> to 
fet on work there upon my own account while I ikaid* 
and either to leave them there, or carry thera forward, 
as they ihould appear willing, particularly I carried two 
carpenters, a fmith, and a yery^handy ingenious fellow, 
who was a cooper by trade, but was -alfo a general me«> 
chanic, for he was dextrous at making wheels, and 
hand-raijls to grijid corn, was a good turner, and a . 
good poL-raaker ; ^he alfo made.van^ thing that, was 4>roper 
to make of earth, or wood ; in.a word, we called him * 
our jack of all trades. 
pi Witli thefe I carried a taylor, who had offered himfelf ^

We ftt out the 5 th of February from Ireland, and bad 
a very fair gale of wind, for fome days ; as I remea- 
ber> it might be about the 20th of February, in the even* 
ing late, when the mate, having the watch, came into 
the round houfe, and told us he !aw a flafh of fire, aod 
heard a gun fired ; and while he was triiing us of it, a 
boy came in, and told us the boatfwain heard another. 
This made us all run out upon the quarter deck, where 
for a while we heard nothing, but in .a few minutes we 
(aw a very great light, and found that there was fome 
very terrible fire at a difUnce ; immediately we had re- 
courfe to our reckonings, in which we all agreed, that 
there could be no land that way, in which the fire 
fhewed itfelf, no, not for 500 leagues, for it appeared 
at W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it muft be ibme 
ihip on fire at fea ; and as by our hearing the noiie 
of guns jufl before, we concluded it could not be far ^ 
off, w« (bod diredll/ towards .it, and were prefently fa* 
tisfied we fhould difcover it, becauie the farther we failed 
the greater the light appeared, though the weather being 

^ hazy, we could not perceive any thing but the light 
for A while ; in about half an hour's failing, the wind 
being fair for us, thpugh not much of it, and the >veathef 
clearmg up a little, we could plainly difcern, that it was 
a great fhip on fire in the middle of the fea. I was 
moil fenfibly touched with this difaller, though not ^ all 
acquainted with the jferibns engaged in it. I prefently 
recollected my former circumitances, in what condition 
1 was in when taken up by the Fortugueie captain ; and 
how much more deplorable the circumfiances of the poor 
creatures belonging to the fhip mufl be, if they had no 
other ihip in company with them ; upon this I im- 
mediately oroercd that five guns ihould be fired, one 
foon after another, that, if poffible, wc might eive notice 
to them, that there was help for them at hand, and that 
they might endeavour to fave themfelve&in their boat; 

* for though we could fee the flame in the ihip, yet they, 
it be^ng night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by fome time upon this, only driving as the 

burning ihip drove, waiting for day-light ; when on a 

fudden, to our great terror, though we had reafoii 

^ cxpc6t it, thp ihip blew up in vVv^ iix , wv^ Vxam^.

(Jiatel J foak ! This was terrible, and indeed ^n afHi^ng 
iight, for the fake, of the poor men, who, I concluded, 
muH be either all deilroyed, in the (hip, (^ be in the ut- 
moil diftrefs in their boats in the middle of the ocean, 
which at prefent, by reafon it was dark, I could not 
fee ; however, to direft thcra as well as I could, I caufed 
lights to be hung out in all the parts of the fhip where 
we could, and which we had lanthoms for, and kept 
firing guns all the night long, letting them know by 
this, that there was, a fhip not far off. ^ 

About eight o'clock in the. morning, we jdifcovered 
tJie fhip's boats, by the help of our perfpedlive-glaffes ; 
and found there were two cSf tjiem, both thronged with 
pec^le, and deep in the water ; we perceived they 
rowed, the wind being agam& them ; that they faw our 
ihip, and did the utmoftto make us fee them. 

We immediatefy fpread oar ancient,. to let them know 
we faw them j. and hung a waft m%s ^ a fizna} fer thefli 
to ceme on board, and then made more Tail, ftandtng 
dire^ily to them. In a little more than half an hour we ^ 
came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in, 
being no lefs than fix ty four men, women and children ; 
for there wei^ a great laaiiy paffengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant 
ihip pT 300 tons, homeward bound from Quebec, in 
the river of Canada. • The mafbr gave u« t long ac- 
-coum of the difire(5 of his ihip, how the fire began in the 
fteerage by the negligence of the fleerfinan, but, on his 
crying put for help, was, as every body thought, entirely 

tut out ; but they foon found that fbme iparks of the 
ril fire had gotten into fome part of the fhip, fo difficult 
to come at, that they could not effe6tually quench it ; and 
afterwards getting in between the timbers, and within 
the cieling of the fhip, it proceeded into the hold, and 
mailered all the ikilLand all the applic^tioi they vrert 
able to exert. > 

They had no more to do then but to get into their 
bo^itf^ which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; 
heknz their long boat, and a great (hallop, befides a 
imair (kiff, which was of no great fervice to them,

her, after ,they had fecored themfelves from the fircr. 
They had indeed fmall hope of their lives by getting 
into thefe boats, at that diflance from any land ; only^ 
as they faid well, that they were eicaped from the fire, 
and had a pofUbilicy that fome ihip might happen ta- 
be at fea, and might take them in. They had fails». 
oars, and a compafs, and were preparing to make the 
bell of their way to Newfoundland, the wind blowing 
pretty fair ; for it blew an eafy gale at S. E . by E. They 
had as much provifions and water, as ^ with fparing it 
io as to \k next door to flarving, might fupport them 
about 12 days, in which, if they had no bad weather, 
and no contraiy winds, the captain faid, he hoped hfr 
might get to the banks of Newfoundland, and might 
perhaps take fome fifh to fuftain them till they might go 
on fhore. But there were fo many chances again ft 
tnem in all thefe cafes ; fuch as ilorms to overfet and 
founder them, raiiw and cold to benumb and perifh 
their limbs; contrary winds to keep them out 'and ftarve 
them,, that it mud have been next to miraculous if they 
. ^ad efcaped. 

In the midft of their' confultations, every one being 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the captain, with tears 
in his eyes told me, they wereonafuddenfurpriftd with 
the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four more ; 
thefe were the five guns which I caufed to be fired at firft 
feeing the light ; this revived their hearts, and gave 
them the notice, which, as above, I defigned it (hould, 
viz. that there was a (hip at hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe guns, that they took . 
down their malls and fails, and the found* coming from 
the windward, they refolved to lie by till morning. 
Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired 
three mufquets, one a coniiderable while after another j 
but thefe, the wind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some time after that again, they were ilill more 
agreeably furprifed with feeing our lights, and hear- 
ing the guns, which, as I have faid, I caufed to 
Jbe fired all the rcfl of the night ; this fet them to 
work with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at 
/e^ ib^t we might the fooner come up with them ;

and at laft, to their inexpredible joy, they found we (aw 
them. 

It is impoilible for me to exprefs the feveral geftures,* 
the ib-ange ecftacies, the variety of pcflures, which thefe 
poor delivered people run into, to exprefs the joy of their 
ioiils, atfo unexpected a deliverance^ grief and fear are 
eafily defcribed riighs, tears, groans, and a very few mo- 
tions of head and hands, making up the fum of its variety: 
but an excefs of .joy, a furpnfe of joy, has a thoufand 
extravaganqies in it; there were fome in tears, fome 
raging and tearing themfelves, as if they had been in the- 
greatdd agonies of forrow ; fome ftark raving and down- 
right lunatic ; fome ran about the fhip flamping with 
their feet, others wringing their hands ; fome were 
dancing, ieveral iinging, fome laughing, more crying, 
many quite dumb, not able to fpeak a word, others fick 
and vomiting, feveral fwooning, and ready to faint, and 
• - ifercwwere crolfing thernieiw* afrdgiyipg Ccd thaiiks* 

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many 
that were thankful afterward ; but the paiiion was too 
ftrong for them at firft, and they were not able to ip«vfter. 
it J tney were thrown into ecftacies and a kind of frenzy, 
and fo there were but a.very few who were compofed and 
feriOtts in. their joy. 

Perhaps ajib the cafe may have fome addition to it^ 
from the particular circumj^ance of the nation they be- 
longed to ; I mean the French, whole temper is allowed 
to be more volatile, more paifionate, and more iprightly, 
and their fpirits more fluid than of other nations, i 
am not philofopher enough to determine the caufe; but 
nothing I had ever Teen, before came up to it : the ec- 
ftacies poor Friday, my trufty iawage, was in, when he 
. found his fathei:^in the boat, came the neaieJft to it; and 
the furprife of the mailer and his two companions, whom 
I delivered from the two villains that fet them on (hore 
in the ifland, came a little way towards it ; but nothing 
was to compare to this, either that I law in Friday, or 
any where elfe in my iife^

obliged to let above thirty of them blood. 

There were two priefts among them, one an old man^

fions of every kind, as well thofe of joy and fati8fa6lk)ft» 

vas thofe of forrow and anger. 

We were fomething di(6rderedt)y thefe extravagancies 
among our new gueits for the firft day ; but when they 
had been refrcfhed, lodgings provided for them as well as 
-our fhip would allow, and they had ilept heartily, as 
moft ot them did, being fatigued and frightened, they 
were quite another fort of people the next day.^ 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments 
for the kindnels (hewn tliem was wanting j the French, 
tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that way. 
The capuin, and one of the pricfts, came to me the. 
next day, and, defiring to fpeak with me and my ne- 
phew, the commander, began to confult With us what 
fliould be done with them ; and firft they told us, that, as 
we had faved their Jives, fo all they had was little 
enough for a return to us fof the kindnefs received. The 
captain faid, they had faved fome^ money, and fome 
things of value in their boats, catched haftily out of the 
flames ; and if we would accept it, they were ordered to 
make an offer of it all to us ; they only defu-ed to be fet 
on fhore fomewhere in our way, where, if poflible, they 
might get a pafTage to Pratvce. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at firft 
word, and to confider what to djo with them afterwards ; 
♦ but 1 twer- ruled him in that part, for I knew what it 
was to be fet on Ihorc in a Ibange country ; and if the 
Portugal captain, that took me up at fea, had ferved me. 
fo, and took all i had for my -deliverance, I muft have 
ftarved, or have been as much a flave at the Braiils, as I; 
had been at Barbary, the being fold to a Mahometan 
only excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguefe is not a muck 
better mafter than a furk^ if not in fome cafes^ a much 
worfe. 

I therefore told the French captain, that we had taken 
them up in their diftrefs, it was true, but that it was 
our duty to do fb, as we were fellow-creatures, and as 
we would deiire to be fo delivered, if we were in the 
like or any other extremity ; that we had done nothing* 
for them, but what we believed thciy would have done 
for us if we had been in their cafe, and they in ours ; 
Jbac that we took them up tp ferve them not to plundert

^Iiem ; and thttt it would be a moA barbarous thing, to 
cake that little from them which they had faved out of 
the fire, and then fet them on fhore, and leave them ; 
that this would be firfl to fave them from death, and 
then kill them ourfelves ; fave them from drowning, and 
then abandon them toftarving; and therefore I would 
not let the lead thing be taken from them ; as to fetting 
them on ihore, 1 told them indeed^ that was an exceed- 
ing great difficulty to us, for that the fbiip was bou nd to the 
Eafl-Indies, and though we were driven out of our 
courie to the weltward a very great way, n^ich perhaps 
was diredled by heaven on purpofe for their deliverance, 
yet it was impoffible lor us wilfully to change our voyage 
on this particular account ; ' nor could my nephew, the 
captain^ anfwer it to the freighters, with whom he was 
under charter-party* to purfue his voyage by the way 
of Braiil ; and all I knew he could do for them was, to 
pat ourfelves in the way of meeting with other fhips 
homeward-bound from the We;ft-Indies, and get them 
paflage, if poffible, to England or France. 

The firft part of the propofal was fo generous and 
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but 
they were in a great confternatbn, eipecially <he pa{^ 
fen^ers^ at the notion of being carried away to the Eaft- 
Jndies ; they then intreated me, that feeing I was driven 
ib far to the weftward before 1 met with then^, I would 
at leaft keep on the fame courfe to the banks of New- 
Ibundland, where it was poflible I might meet with fome 
ikip or iloop that they might hire to carry them back to 
X^anada» from whence they came. " 

I thought this was but a reafonable requeft on their 
p^t ; and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for indeed 
I confideredy that to carry this whole company to the 
Eaft-Indies, would not only be an intolerable feverity to 
the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voy- 
age by devouring all our provifions ; To I thought it no 
l>reach of charter-party, but what an nnforefeen acci- 
dent made abfdutely neceflary to us, and in which no 
one could (ay we were to blame ; ibr the laws of God 
and aatnre would have forbid, that we fhould refufe

in no paflengers for fear <)f waiting provifiofis for the 
voyage, as well for themfeWes as for thofe t^y ikonld 
take in ; fo we were obliged to go on. It wai afaont a 
week after this, that we made the Banks of Ni^wfotind- 
land, where, to ftiorten my ftory, we put all our French 
people on board a bark, which they hired ^t fea thoi;e» 
to put them on fhore, and afterwards to carry them to 
France, if they could get proviiion to vi^al themfelves 
with: when, I fay, all the French w^t on fhore, I 
fliould remember, that the young prieft I fp^eof^ 
hearing we were bound to the E&& Indies, defired to 
go the voyage with us, and to be fet on fhore on the

wonderfully liked the man, and had very gpod maibn, 
as will appear afterwards; alfb four of the fei^Jiiea

Sarbadoesy but had been blown out of the road at Bar« 
badoes, a few days before ihe was ready to fail, by a 
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate \ 
were both gone onihbre; fo that beiide the terror of the 
Ibomi, they were but in an indifferent cafe for good 
artiUs to bring the (hip home : they had been already 
nine weeks at fea, and had met with another terrible 
^orm after the huiticane was over, which had blown 
them quite out of their knowledge to the weftward, 
and in which they loft their mafcs, as «bove ; they told 
]U8, they expe6ted to have feen the Bahama Iflands, but 
were then driven away again ko the fouth-eaii:, by s

But that which was worft of all, was, that they were

:they had undergone : their thread and flefh was quite

'H ADVENTURES OV 

I had perhaps, not known this part, if my curioftty 
Jiad not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind 
abated, to go on board the lliip : the fecond mate, whe 
rupon this oceafion commanded the fliip, had been on 
board our Ihip^ ^andhe told me indeed, that they had 
-three palTengersin-the great cabin, that they were in a 
.deplorable condition ; nay, fays he, I believe they are 
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two 
days : and I was afraid to enquire after them, faid he, 
^for I. had nothing to relieve them with. 

We immediately applied ourfelves to givethem what 
.relief we could fpare; and indeed 1 had fo far over-ruled 
things with my ixephew, that I would have victualled 
•them, though we had gone aWay to Virginia, or any 
part of the coaft of Amenca, to have fupplied ourfelves; 
.but there was no neceffity for that. 

But now they were in a new danger ; for they were 
.afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them ; 
*the mate or commander brought fix men with him in his 
boat ; but thefe poor wretches looked like ikeletous, and . 
were fo weak, they could hardly fit to their oars : the 
mate himfelf was very ill, and halfftarved ; for lie de- 
clared he had referved nothing from the men, and went 
iharc and fhare alike with them in every bit they ^at. 

I cautioned him to eat fparingly, but fet meat hefore 
kim immediately, and h« had not eaten three mouthfuls 
before he began to be fick, and out of order; fo he ftopt 
awhile, and our Surgeon mixed him up fomething with 
fome broth, which he faid would be to him both food 
andphyiick; and after he had taken it, he grew better ; 
in the mean time, I forgot not the men ; I order'd 
victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather 
devoured than eat it; they were fo exceeding hungry, 
that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no com- 
mand of themfelves; and two of them eat with fo much 
grecdinefs, that they were in danger of their lives thj? 
.next morning. , 

The fight of thefe peoples diftrefs was very moving 
to ipe, and brought to mind what I had a terrible prof- 

Jed of at my firft comin|; on Ihore in my illand, where 
hud not the leaft mouthful of food, or any hopes of 
j>rocvring it ; bcfidea the hourly appr^cnfion I had

%f being made the food of other creatures. But all th^ 
while the mate was thus relating to me the miferable 
condition of the fliip's company, I could not put out 
of ray thought the ftory he had told me of the three 
poor creatures in the great cabin (viz) the mother, her 
Ton, and the maid fervait, whom he had heard nothing 
of for two or three days; and whom he fecn^ed to x:on* 
fefs they had wholly negledted, their own extremities 
\>tmg fo great; by which I underllooS, that they had 
really given them no food at all; ahd that therefoie they 
mufk be periflied, and be all lying dead perhaps on the 
floor or delk of the cabin* 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called 
captain, on board with his men to refrefli them, fo I alfa 
forgot not the ftarving crew that were left on board, but 
ordered my owji boat to go on board the ihip, and with, 
jny mate and twelve men to carry them a fack of bread, 
tmd four orfi ve pieces of beef to boil. Our furgeon charged 
the men to caule the meat to lie boiled while they flayed^ 
and to keep guard in the cook-roam, to preycnt the mens 
taking It to eat raw or taking it out of the pot before it 
>vas well boiled, and then to give every man but a little 
at a time; and by this caution he prefer ved the men, who 
would otherwife have-killed thcmfelves with that very 
food that was given them on purpofe to favc their lives. 

At the fame time, I ordered the mate to go into the 
^reat cabin, and fee in what condition the poor paflen- 
gers were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them and 
give them what rcfrefhment was proper; and the furgeon 
gave him a large pitcher with fomeof the prepared brotk 
which he had given the mate that was on hoar^, and 
which he.didnot ciueflion would reflore them gradually* 

I was not fatistied with this;, but, as I faid above, 
iiaving a great mind to fee the (bene of mifery,* which I 
knew the fhip itlelf would prefent me with, in a more 
lively manner than I could have it by report, 1 took the 
captain of the fhip, as we now called him, with me, and 
went myfelf a little after in their boat. 

1 found the poor men on hoard almoft in a tumult 
to get the victuals out of theboiler beforeit was ready:

placed tkere, after ufing all poifible pcrfuafion to have 
patience, kept them off by force : however, he caufed 
iome bifcuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and foftened 
them with the liquor of the meat, which they call 
brewis, and gave them every one one, to (lay their 
itomachs, and told them it was for their own fafety that 
he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But 
it was all in vain, and had I not come on board, and 
their own commander and officers with me, and with 
.good words, and iome threats alfo of giving them no 
more, I believe they would have broke into the cook- 
room by force, and tore the meat out of the furnace ; 
for words indeed are of a very fmall force to an hungry 
belly : however we pacified them-, and fed them gradu- 
ally and cautioufly for the firft time, and the next time 
gave them more, and at laft filled their bellies, and the 
men dii well enough. 

But the miferyof the poop pafTengers in the cabin was 
-of another nature, and far beyond the reft; for as, firft, 
the (hip's company had fo little for themfelves, it was 
but too true, that they had at firft kept them very low, 
and at laft totally negledled them ; fo that for fix or 
fcven days, it might be faid, they had really had no 
ibod at all, and for feveral days before, very little. 

The poor mother, who, as the firft mate reported, was 
a woman of good fenfe, and good breeding, had fpared 
all ihe could get fo affe6tionately forher fon, that at laft 
ihe entirely funk unde. it .' and when the mate of our 
(hip went in, ftie fat upon the floor of deck, with her 
back up againft the fides, between two chairs, which 
were laftied faft, and her head funk in between her fliouL- 
Wtf like a corpfe, though not quite dead. My mate 
faid all he could to revive and encourage her,, and with 
a fpoon put fome broth into her mouth ; fhe opened her 
lips, ancf lifted up one hand, but could not fpeak ; yet 
ihe underftood what he faid, and made figns to him, in- 
timatine, that it was too late for her; but pointed to 
her child^ as if fhe would have faid, they mould take 
care of him. 

However the mate, who wasxcxceedingly moved with 
the fight, endeavoured to get fome of the broth into her 
mouth ; and, as he faid^ got two or three fpoonfuls down, 

though

thougli I qucftion whether he could be fureofit ornot; 
but it was too late-, and (he died the fame night. 

The youth, who was preferred at the price of his moft 
afFccftionate mother^s li^, was not fo far gone; yet he lay 
in a cabin-bed as one ftretched out, with hardly any life 
left in him; he had a piece ofan old glove in his mouthy 
having eaten up the reft of it; however being young, 
jind having more ftrength than his mother, the mate got 
fomething down his throat, and he began fenfibly to re- 
vive, though by giving him fome time after, but two or 
three fpoonfuls extraordinary, he wae very fick, and 
brought it up again* 

But the next care was the poormaid; (he lay all along^ 
iipon the deck hai'd by her miftrefs, and juft like one that 
had fallen down with an apoplexy, and ftruggled for. 
' life; her limbs were diftorted, one of her hands was 
elafped round the frame of one chair, and ihe griped it 
{o hard, that we could not eafily make her let it go; her 
•ther arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both to- 
gether, fet faft againft the frame of the cabin-table; in> 
mort, fhe lay juft like one ia the laib agonies of death;^ 
and yet fhe was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only (larved with hunger, 
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the me» 
told us afterwards, was brokea-helarted for her miftrefs, 
^hom fhe faw dying two or three days before, and 
whom ihe loved moft tfenderly. 

We knew not what tado^with this poor girl; for whett 
^ur furgeon, who was a man of very. great knowledge 
and experience, aad with great application recovered her 
as to life, lie had' her upon his hand as taher feiifes, for

pieces of eight of them far fatisfadion, we left them, 
'taking on board with us, at their own earneft reqnefi:, 
the youth, and the tnaid, and all their goods . 

The young lad was about feventeen yean of age, a 
pretty, well bred, modeft, and fenfiblc youth ; greatly ' 
^jedled with the lofs of his mother, and as it feemt» 
kad loft his father but a few months before at Bar- 
dadoes. He begged of the fargeon to fpeak to me, to 
take him out of the fliip; for he faid, the cruel fellows 
had murdered his mother; and indeed fo they had, that 
ia to fay, paffively; for they might have fpared afmall 
fufleaance to the poor helplefs widow, that might have 
prefcrved her life, though it had been iuft to keep her 
alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no juf- 
tice, no right; ami therefore is remorfelefs, and capabb

The furgeon told him how far we were going, and hofit 
k would carry him away from all his friends, and put^ 
him perhaps; in as bad circumftances almoD;, as we

not be removed, or come at ; and as tha youth had a

/ Thus coafting from one iftand to another, fometimet' 
with the (hip, fometimes with the Frenchman's Ihallop, 
ivhich we had found a conrenient boat, and therefore 
kept her with their very good will, at length I came fair 
©n the fouth-lide of my ifland, and I prefently knew the 
very countenance of the place ; fo I brought the fliip 
fefe to an anchor, broadfide with the little creek where 
was my old habitatioh. 

As fcon as I faw the place, I called for Friday and 
aiked him, ifheknew where he was? He looked about a 
little, and prefently clapping his hands, cried; O yes, O 
there> Oyes, O there, pointing to o»r old habitation, and 
fell a dancing and capering like a mad feUow* and I had 
»uch ado to keep him from jumping into the fca, td 
fwim afhore to the place. 

Well, Friday, faid 1, do you think we (hnll find any 
body here or no? And what do you think, fhall we fee 
your father? The fellow ftood mute as a ftock a good 
while; but wheii I named his father, the poor affectionate 
creature looked dejt^d; and I could fee the tears run 
down his face very plentifully. What is the matW Fri- 
day, faid I? Are you troubled becaufe you may fee your 
father? No, no, 4ys he, (baking his head, no fee him 
more, no ever more fee again. Why fo, faid I Friday? 
How do you know thatf O no, O no, fays Friday, he 
long ago die; long ago he much old man. Well, well 
faid I, Friday, you don't know^j^tihall we fee any one 
dfe then: the fellow, it feems,^ad better eyes than I» 
and he points juft to the hill above my old houfe; and 
the* we lay half a , league of, he cries out Me fee! me 
iee! yes, yes, me fee much man there, and there, and 
these; I looked, but I could fee nobody, no, not with a 
perfpe£tive glafs; which was, I fappofe, becaufe I could 
not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as I found 
upon enquiry the next day, and there were five or fix 
men .\ Itogether flood to<look at the (hip, not knowing 
what to think of us. 

As ibon as Friday had told me he faw people, I caufed 
the Englifh ancient to be fpread, and fired three guns, 
to give them notice we were friends; and about half 
a-^uarter of an hour after, we perceived a fmoak rife

I met with in my converiing with them, and with the

In order to do tins fuccinftly, and as intelligibly as I 
can, I muft go back to the circumftance in which I left 
the ifland, and which the perfons were in, of whom I 
amto fpcak, ' AtfirftitisneceiTaryto repeat, that I had 
ient away Friday^s father and the Spaniards, the twa 
whofe lives I had refcued from the favagcs ;, I fay, I 
liad fent them away in a large canoe to the main, as T 
then thought it, to fetch pver the Spaniard's companions 
whom he had left l)ehind him *in order to fave* them 
from the like calamity that lie l»d been in; and in or-

I any foreknowledge of what after happened, I mean of

j>art: and I defired he would give me a particular af:- 
count ofhis voyagc'back to his countrjrmea with the 
boat, when I fent him to fetch them over« He told 
me there was little variety in that part; for nothing re- 
markable happened to them on the way^ they having 
very calm weather, and a fmooth fea; for his coun- 
trymen, it could not be doubted, he faid, but that they 
were overjoyed to fee ham: (it feems he was the prin- 
cipal man among them, the captain of the vefTel they 
had been fhipwrecked in, having been dead fome time:) 
They were, he fjMd, the more furpnfed to fee him, be- 
caufe they knew that he was fallen into the hands of 
favages, who, they were fatisiied, would devour him, 
■as they did all the reft of their prifoncrs; that when he 
told them the ftory of the delivjtrancc, and in what 
manner he was furnifhed for carrying them away, it 
ivas like a dream to them: and their aflonifhment,' they 
faid, was fomething like that of Jofeph's brethren, 
when he told them who he was, and told them the 
ftory of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court: but when 
lie ihewed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and 
the provifions that he brought them for their journey 
or voyage, they were reftored to themlelves, took a 
jufi: fhare of the joy^f thcar deliverance, and imme- 
diately prepared to come away with him. 

Their firft bufinefs was to get canoes; and in thit 
they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the honeft 
part of it, but to trefpafs upon their friendly favages, 
and to borrow two lar^e canoes or periagua's on pre- 
tence of going out a fifhing, or for pleafure. 

In the^ they came away the next morning; it"fecmt 
they wanted no time to get themfelves ready, for they 
liaa no baggage, neither clothes, or provifions, or any 
thing in the world, but what they had on them, ^ and a 
few roots to eat, of which they ufed to make their bread. 
They were in all three we^ks abfent, and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occafion offered 
for my efcape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
to get off from the ifland; leaving three of the moft

the poor Spaniards great grief and diJappointment,

The only juft thing the rogues did, was, that whetr 
the Spaniards came on Ihore, they gave my letter to 
them, and gave them provifions, and other relief, as I 
had ordered them to do ; alfo they gave them the long 
paper of diredions, which I had left with them, con- 
taining the particular methods which I took for managing 
every part of my life there, the wav how I baked my 
bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted my corn, 
how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word,^ 
every thing I did ; all this being written down, they 
gave to the Spaniards, two of whom underjftood Englifh 
well enough ; nor did they refufe to accommodate the 
Spaniards with any thing elfe, for they agreed very well 
for fomc time, they gave them an ec^ual admiflion into 
the houfe,or cave, and they began to hve very fcciably; 
and the head Spaniard, who had feen pretty much of my 
method, and Friday's father together, managed all their 
affairs 5 for, as for the Engliihmen, they did nothing 
but ramble about the iflahd, fhoot parrots, and catch 
tortoifeS) and when they came home at night, the Spa- 
niards provided their fuppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisiied with this, 
would the other but have let them alone ; whicb,,how- 
cver,^ they could not find in their hearts to do Ipng ; 
but, like the ^og in the manger, they would not eat 
themfelves, and would net let others eat neither : the 
differences, neverthelefs, were at firft but trivial, and 
fuch as are not worth relating : but at lafl it broke out 
into open war, and it began with all the rudcnefs and 
infolence that can be imagined, without reafon, without 
provocation, contrary to nature, and Indeed, to com- 
mon fenfe ; and though it is true, the firft relation of it 
came from the Spaniards themfelves, whom I may call 
the accufers, 7et when I came to examine the fellows^ , 
they could not deny a word of it.

happened a little quarrel on board oar fhip, whick I was 
afraid once would turn to a fecond mutiny ; nor was it 
appeafed, till the captain, roufing up his courage, and 
taking us all to his affiftance, parted them by force, 
and making two of the moft refractory fallows prifon- 
ers, he laid them in irons; and as they had been adtivc, 
in the former diforders, and let fall fome ugly danger- 
ous words the fecond time^ he threatened to carry ihem 
in irons to England, and have them hanged there for 
mutiny, and running away with the ibip. 

This, it feems, though the captain did not intend to 
do It, frighted fome other men in the fhip ; and fome 
of them had put it in the heads of the refb, that the cap- 
tain only gave them good words for the prefent, till they 
ihould come to fome Englifli port; and that then they 
fhould be all put into a gaol, and tried for their livcis. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us 
with it ; upon which it was cfefired, that I, who iUU 
pafled for a great man among them, fhould go down 
with th« mate^ and fatisfy the men, and tell them, that 
they might be affurcd, if they behaved well the reft of 
the voyage, all they had dons for the time paft, Ihould 
be pardoned. So I went, and after pafling my Honour's' 
word to them, they appeared eafy, and the more fo, 
when I caufed the two men, who were in irons, to be 
releafed and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that 
night, the wind Alfo falling calm ; next m«ming we 
found, that our two men who had been laid in irons, 
had ftole each of them a muiket, and fome other wea- 
pons ; what powder or ihot they had, we knew not ; 
and had taken the fhip*s pinnace, which was not yet 
haled ,up» and run away with her to their companions 
in roguery on fhore. 

As foon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on 
fiiore, with twelve men and the mate, and away they 
went to feek the rogues ; but they could neither find 
them, nor any of the reft ; for they all fled into the woods, 
when they faw the boat coming on Ihore. The mate- 
was once refolved, in juftice to their roguery, to have 
deftroyed their plantations, buriit all their houlhold-ftuff ' 
and furmture, and left them to fliift without it ; but

on lx)ard without them. 

Thefe two men made their number Rve^ but the 
<ether three villains were fo much wickeder than thefc, 
that after they had been two or three days together, 
they turned their two new-comers out of doors to fliift 
for themfelves, and would have nothing to do with 
. them r nor could they for a good while, be perfuadedv 
to give them any food; as for the Spaniards, they were 
not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came firft on fhore, the bufinefs • 
l>egan to go forward; the Spaniards would have per- 
fuaded the three Englifh brutes to have taken in their^ 
two countrymen again, that, as they faid, they might 
be all one family ; but they would not hear of it : fo 
the two poor fellows lived by themfelves, and finding, 
nothing out induftry and application would make them 
live comfortable, they pitched their tents- on the^north 
ihore of the ifland, but a little more to the wefl, to b© 
out of the danger of the Tavages, who always landed, 
on the caft parts of the ifland. 

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and the 
other to lay up their magazines ^ind ftores in; and the 
Spaniards having given" them fome corn for feed, and 
jefpecially fome of the peas which I had left them, they 
^ug and planted, and iiiclofed, after the pattern I had 
fct for them all, and began to live pretty well; their firft 
crop of corn was on the ground, and though it was 
but a little bit of land which they had dug up at firfl, 
having had but a little dme, yet it was enough to re- 
lieve them, and find them with bread and other eatables; 
and one of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the 
Ihip, was very ready at making^ foup, puddings, and 
fuch other preparations, as the rice, and the milk, and 
fuch little flefh as they got, furnilhcd him to do. 

They were goin«r on in a little thrivir;: polhire, when

The two men thought they had jefted at fXrfl; and 
^ed them to come and fit down, and fee what fine 
houfes they were that they had built, and tell them what 
rent they demanded: and one of them merrily told them, 
if they were ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built 
tenements upon the land, and made improvements, they 
would, according to the cuftom of all landlords, grant 
them a long leafe, and bid them go fetch a fcrivencr to 
draw the writings. One of the three, damning and raging, 
told them, they fhould fee th©y were not in ajefl; and go- 
ing to a little place at adiflance, where the honed meii 
had made a fire to drefs their victuals, he takes a fire- 
brand, and clafps it to the o,atfide of their hut, and very 
fairly fet it on fire; and it would have been all burnt 
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not nm to 
the fellow, thru ft him away, and trod the fire out with 
his feet, and that not without fome difficulty too. 

The fellow was in fuch a rage at the honefl man'i 
thrufting him away, that he turned upon him with a pole 
he had in his hand; and had not the man avoided the 
blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended 
his days at once. His comrade, feeing the danger they 
were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they 
came both out with their mufquets; and the man that 
was firft ftruck sit with the pole, knocked the fellow- 
down, who began the quarrel, with the ftock of their 
mufquet, and that before the other two could come td 
help nim; and then feeing the reft come at them, they 
^ood together, and prefenting the other ends of their 
pieces to them, bade them ftand off. 

The other had fire-arms with them too; but one of 
the two honeft men, bolder than his comrade, and made 
idefperate by his danger, told them, if they offered to 
move hand or foot, they were all dead men; and boldly

corn, fhooting three young kids, and a Ihc-goat, which 
the poor man had got to breed up tame for their (lore ; 
and,' in a word, plaguing them night and^ dUy.m. this, 
manner, it forced the two men to fucb a defperation,. 
that they refolved to fight them all .three the firft time 
they had a fair opportunity. In order to this they re- - 
folved to go to the caftle, as they called it, that was my 
old dwelling, where tho.threc rogues and tlie Spaniards. ^ 

all lived together, at that tiine, intending to have a fair. * 

battle, and the Spaniards ihould (land by to fee fair - 
play. So they got up in the. morning before day, and 
came to the place, and called the Englifhmen By theif 
names, telling a Spaniard that anfwered, that they, 
w^mted to fpeak with them. 

Jt happened that the day before^ two of the Spaniards, .' > 
having been in the woods, had fceii one of the two ^

and deilroyed their corn, that they had labouredfo hard 
to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their 
three kids, which was all they had provided for their 
fudcnance ; and that if. he and his friends-^ meaning 
the Spaniards,. did not aflift them again, they (hould be 
flarved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and,

One of the Englifhmen returned very briflcly, What 
had they to do there ? That they came on fhore without 
leave, and that they fhould not plant or build upon the 
ifland ; it was none of their ground. Why, fays the 
Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Inglefe, they muft not 
flarvc. The Englifhman replied, like a truerufF-hewn 
tarpaulin, they might ftarvc and be damn 'd, they ihould 
not plant, nor build in that place. But what muft they 
do then. Seignior,^ fays the Spaniard? Another of the 
brutes returned, do ! d—rn them, they fhould befervants, 
and work for them. But how can yo^ cxpedl that of 
them ? They are not bought with yopr nioney ; you 
have no right to make them fervants. Th^ Englifhmen 
anfwered, the ifland was theirs, the goVe^^nor had given 
it to them, and no man had any thing ts> do there buc 
themfelves ; and with thatfwore by his Milder, that he 
would go and bum all their new huts; thty ihould 
build none upon their land. _ . 

Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard by the fame rule 
w« muft be your fervants too. ^, fays the bold dog^ 
and fo you fhall too, before we nave done with you, 
mixing two or three G*-d d — mme's in the proper in- 
tervals of his fpcech. The S]paniard only fmiled at 
that, and made him no anfwer. However, this little dif- 
courfe had heated them ; and ftarting uj), one fays to the 
.. other, I think it was he they called Will Atkins, come 
Jack, let us go and have the other bruih with them t 
we will demolifli their caftle, I will warrant you; they

Upon this they were all trooping away, with every

infolent things among themfelves, of what they would 
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered; but 
the Spaniards, it feems, did not fo perfe(5lly underfland

were afleep ; and they acknowledged it afterwards, in- 
tending to fet fire to their huts while they were in them, 
and either bum them in them, or murder them as they 
came out : and as malice feldom flceps very found, it 
was very ftrange they would not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two men had alfo a defign upon 
them, as I have faid, tho* a much fairer one than that of 
burning and murdering, it happened,, and very luckily 
for them all, that they were up and* gone abroad, be- 
fore the bloody minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came thither and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who*7^e€n^ was the forwardfell man, called out* 
to his comra^s, ha ! Jack, here's the neft ; but d-— n^ 
them, the birds arc flown : they mufed awhile to think 
what (b0uld be the occafion of their being gone abroad 
fo fooB, and fug^efted prefently, that the Spaniards had 

fiven them notice of it ; and with that they fhook 
ands, and fworc to one another, that they would be 
revenged of the Spaniards. As foon as they had made 
this bloody tiargam, they fell to work with the poor 
mens habitation ; they did not fet fire indeed to any 
thing, but they pulled down both thiir houfes, and pul- 
led them fo limb from limb, that they left not the leaft 
flick ftanding, or fcarce any fign on the ground where 
they ftood i they tore all their little colleaed houlhold- 
ituff in pieces, and threw every thing about in fuch a 
manner, that the poor men found, afterwards, fomc o£ 
their things a mile off^from their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the young 
trees which the poor men had planted; pulled up the 
inclofure they had made to fecure their cattle and their 
corn; and, in a word, facked and plundered everything 
as completely as- a herd of Tartars would have done.. 

The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out 
and had relblved to fight them where ever they had been 
tho* they were but two to three: fo that, had they met 
there certainly would have been bioodfhed among them;

their arms again, while they appeared fo refolved to do 
mifchief with them tottheir own countrymen, atid had 
even threatened them all to make them their fervants. 

The rogues were now more capable to hear reafon 
than to a6t reaifon ; but being tefufed their arms, they 
went raving away, and raging like madmen, threaten- 
ing what they would do, though they had no fire arms: 
but the Spaniards, defpifing their thrieatening, told them 
they Ihouldtake care how they offered any injury to their 
plantation or cattle; for if they did, they would flioot . 
them, as they would do ravenous bcafts, wherever 
they found them; and if they fell into their hands 
alive, they would certainly be hanged. However this 
was far from cooling them ; but away they went, fwear- 
ing and raging like furies of hell. ^ As foon as they 
were gone, came back the two men in paifion and rage 
enough alfo, though of another kind; for, having been 
at their plantation, and finding it all demolifhed and de- 
ftroyed, as above, it will eafily be fuppofed they had 
provocation enough ; they could fcaree have room to 
tell their tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell them 
theirs; and it was ftrange enough to find, that three 
men fhouldthus bully nineteen, and receive no punifh- 
ment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpecially 
having thus difarmed, made light of their threat- 
enimgs : but the two Englifhmen refolved to have their 
remedy agaioft them, what pains foever it coft to find 
them out. 

But the Spaniards interpofed here too, and told them, 
that they were already difarmed : they could not confent, . 
that they (the two) fhould purfue them with fire^arms, 
and perhaps kill them : but, faid the grave Spaniard,

The tiVo Engliftimen yielded to this very aukwardly,

they did it only to keep them from bloodfhed, and to 
make all eafy at laft ; for, fald they, we are not fo

they did confent, and waited for the iiTue of the thing,

and the other larger than they were before ; alio to fenct 
their ground again, where they had pulled up the fences, 
plant trees in the room of thofe^^Julled up, dig up the 
land again for planting corn, where they had fpoiled it ; 
and, in a word^ to rellore every thing in the fame flate 
as they found it, as near as they could ; for entirely it could 
taot be, the (eafon for the corn, ai^d the growth of the 
trees and hedges, not being poflible to be recovered. 

Well, they all fubmitted to this ; and as they had 
plenty of provifions given them all the while, they 
grew very orderly, and the whole fociety began to live 
plcafantly and agreeably toge;tber again ; only thatthefe 
three fellows could never be pcrfuaded to work ; I meaa 
not for thcmfelves, except now and then a little, juft at 
they pleafed ; however, the Spaniards told thejn plainly, 
that if they would, but live fociably and friendly together, 
iand fludy in the whole the good of the plantation, they 
would be content to work for them, and let them walk ~ 
about and be as idle as they pleafed ; and thus having 
lived pretty well together for a month or two, the Spa- 
^ niai'ds gave them th^irarms again, and gave them liber- 
ty to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had thefe arm$» 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to 
be as iniblent and troublcfome as before ; but however, 
an accident happened prefently upon this, which en-

It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,

had fayed, who was now the captain, or leader, Qr 
governor of the reft, found himfelf very uneafy in the 
night, and eould by no means get any fleep s he was 
perfedly well in body, as he told me the flory, only 
found his thoughts tumultuous ; his mii\d ran upon 
men fighting, and killing one another, but was broad 
awake, and could not by any means get any deep ; in 
ihort, he lay a great while; but growing more and more 
uneafy, he refolved to rife : as they lay, being fo many

Being thas |^otten up« he looked out ; but, being, dark,

a clear ftar-light night; and, hearing no noife, he rc»

could not ileep, nor could he compofe himfelf to any 
thing like reft, but his thoughts were to the lail degree 
Qheaiy, and yet he knew not for what. 

Having made fome noife with rifing and walking 
about, going out and coming in, another of them waked^ 
and, calling, aiked who it was that was up? The go- 
vernor told him, how it had been with him: Say yovi

Where are the Englifhmen? They are all in their huts^

number. 

In all the difcoveries I had made of the favages land** 
ing on the ifland, it was my conftant care to prevent 
them making the leaft difcovery of there being any in- 
habitant upon the place ; and when by any neceffity 
they came to know it^ they felt it (o effe^toally, that 
they that got away, were ftarce able to give any ac- 
count of it, f«r we difappeared ^s foon as poflible, nor

elfe, except it were the three favages in our laft en- 
counter, who jumped into the boat, of whom I mention- 
ed, that I was afraid they fhould go home^ and bring 
more help. 

Whether it was the confequence of the . efcape of 
thofe men, that fo great a number came now together ; 
or whether they came ignorantly, and by accident, on 
their ufual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not it 
leems underhand ; but whatever it was, it had been their 
bufmefs, either to have concealed themfelves> and not 
have feen them at all ; much lefs to have let the favagct 
have feen, that there were any inhabitants in the place; 
but to have fallen upon them foefrc£tually9aB that not a 
mati of them fhould have efcaped, <^hich could only 
have been by getting in between them an4 their 
boats ; but this piefence of mind was wanting to thern^ 
which was the ruin of their tranquility for a great 
while. 

We need not doubt, but that the governor, and the 
man ivith him, furprifed with thisii^ht; ran backimme* 
diately, and raifed their fellows, giving them ah accoiuit 
of the imminent danger they were all in ; and they again

fecondly, they did not keep together, but were (Uvided 
mto feverai parties, and were on fhore tnfeveral places, 
llie Spaniards were in no fmall conHernation at this 
fight : and as they found, that the fellows ran f^ragglin^ 
aill over the fhore, they made no doubt, but, firft or laft, 
fome of them w«uld chop in upon their habitation, er 
upon fome other place, where they would fee the tokens 
of inhabitants ; and they were in great perplexity alfo 
for fear of their flock of goats, which would have been 
little lefs than ftarving them, if they (hould have been 
deftroyed ; fo the firft thing they relolved upon, was to 
difpatch three men away before it was light, viz. two 
Spaniards and one Englifhrnan, to drive all the goats 
away to the great valley where the cave was, and, if 
need were, to drive them i^to the very cave itfelf^ 

Could they have fcen the favagcs altogether in one 
body, and at a diftance from their conoes, they refolr- 
ed, if there had been and hundred of them, to have at- 
tacked them J but that could not bex>btained, for, 
they were fome of them two miles off from the other,

that they had no notion of any body's being on the 
ifland but themfelves. He had hardly made an end of 
telling the Hory, when they could perceive, by the un- 
^ufual noife they made, that the two little armies were 
^engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father ufed all the arguments he could to 
.perfuade our jjeoplc to lie clofe, and not be feen ; he 
stold them, their lafety confined in it, and that they had 
nothing to do but to lie ftill, and the favages would kill 
one another to their hands, and the reft would go away; 
and it was fo to a tittle, -But it was impoffible to pre- 
vail, efjpecially upon the Englilhmen ; their cui iolitj 
was fo importunate upon their prudentials, -xh-dt they 
rmuft run out and fee the .^battle : however, they ufed 
fome caution, viz. they did not goopenlyjuftby their

placed themfelves to advantage, where they might fe- 
curely fee them manage the fight, and, as they thought 
jiot to be feen by them ; 1)111, it feems, the favages did 
fee them, as we ihall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and if 1 might believe 
the Engliflimen, one of them, faid, he could perceive, 
fthat fome of them were men of great bravery, of invin- 
cible fpirits, and of great policy in guiding the fights 
The battle, they fiiid, held two hours, before they 
»could guefs which party would be beaten ; but then 
that party which was ncarefl our people's habitation, 
began to appear weakefl, and after fome time more, 
•fome of them began tc fly ; ancl this put our men again 
into a great .confternation, left any of thofe that fled 
ihould run into the grove, before their dwelling, for 
Ihelter, and thereby involuntarily difcover the place ; 
and that by confequence the purfuers fhoi>ld do the 
like in fearch for them. Upon this they refolved, that 
they would ftand armed within the wall, and whoever 
came into the grove, they fliould fally out over the 
wall, and kill them ; fo that, if poflible, not one fhould

As they expre6ted> it- fell out; three of the routed 
army fled for life, and croflmg the creek, ran dire£tly 
into the place, ^ not in the leau knowing wh'ther they 
wenr, but runniag as into a thick wood for melter ; the 
fcout they^ kept to- look abroad, gave notice of this 
within, with this addition; to our men^s great fatif- 
fadion, viz. That the conquerors had not purfued 
them, orfeen which way they were gone. Upon this, the 
Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would *no^ 
fufFer them tb kill the threefugitives ; but, fending three 
men out by^ the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, 
and come in bchmd them, furprize and take them pri- 
ibners, which was done ; the refiduc of the conquered 
people fled to their canoes, and got off tofea : the vic- 
tors retired, and made no purfuit, or very little ; but, 
drawing themfclves intoa body together, gave two great 
fcpcaming ihouts, which they fuppofed were by way 
€ff triumph, and fo the fight ended ; and'thc fame day, 
about three o'clock in the afternoon, they alfd marched 
to their canoes, and thus the Spaniards had their ifland 
again free to themfelvcs, their fright was over, and they 
law no favages in fcveral years afters 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out o£ 
their den; and, viewmg the field of battle, they foand* 
about two and thirty dead men upon the fpot ; fome. 
Were killed with great long arrows, feveral of which 
were found flicking in their bodies ; but moft of them 
were killed with their great wooden fwords, fixteen or 
feveiiteen of which they found in the field of ' battle, 
and as many bows, with a great many arrows ; thefe 
fwords were great unweilay things, and they mufl: be 
very ftrong men that ufed them ; moft of thofe men that 
were killed with them, had their heads mafhed to pieces, 
as we may fay, or, as we call it in Englifh, their brains 
knockpd out, and feveral of their arms 'and legs broken ; 
fo that it is evident they fight with inexpreflible rage and 
fury ; they found not one wounded man that was not

This deliverance tamed our Engliflipien for a great 
wh le ', the light had filled them with horror, and the 
confequence appeared terrible to the laft degree, efpeci- 
:illy upoil fuppoling that feme time or other they fliould 
fall into the hands of thofe creatures ; who would not 
only kin them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we 
kill our cattle. And they profefled to me, that the 
thoughts of being 'Caten up like beef or mutton, though 
it was fuppo^ed it was not to-be till they were dead, had 
fOmething in it fo horrible, that it nau'leated their very 
ftomachs, made them iick when they thought of it, and 
filled their minds with unufual terror, that they were 
not tliemlelves for feme weeks after. 

This, as I faid, tamed even the three Engliih brutea I 
have been fpcaking of; and for a great while after 
they Were Ycry tradable, and went about the common 
bunnefs of the whole focicty well enough ; planted, 
f0wed, reaped, and began to be all naturalized to the 
country ; but fome time after this, they fell all Into 
fuch jfimple meafuree a^ain as brought them into a great 
tleal of trouble. 

They had taken three prifoners, as 1 had obferved ; 
and thefc three being lully ftcut young fellows, they 
made them fcrvants, and taught them to work for them, 
an:^, as flaves they did well enough ; but they did not 
tjike th^Ir meafures with them as 1 did by my man Fri- 
clay, vi'A, to begin with them upoa the principle of hav^

tional principles of life, much left of religion, civilizing 
a^d reducing them by kind ufage, and affedionate ar-

io they gave them their work too, -and kept them fully 
employed in drudgery enough ; but, they failed in this 
i)y it,'that they never had them to dlift them andfighe 
for them, as I had my man Friday, who was as true to 
jne as the very flefh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part ; being all now gpod 
friends (for common danger, as I faid above, had 
effet^itally reconciled them) they began to conlider their 
general circumftances rand the firft thing that came

ftnd that tliere were more remote and retired parts of it 
equally adapted to' their wav of living, and manifeftly to 
their advantage, they ihoula not rather remove their ha* 
bitatiDn, and plant m fome more proper place for their 
iafety, and efpecially for the fecurity of their cattle and 
corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it \yas conceived, that 
they fiiould not remove their babkatioa ; becaufe that 
fome time or other they thought they might hear from 
their governor again, meaning; me i and if I fliouU fend 
any one to feek them, I would he fwrc to direft them on 
that fide, where, if they fiiould find the place demolifiied^ 
they would conclude the favages had killed us alh and 
we were gone, and fo our fupply would go away too. 
. But ^ to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove 
them into the valley where my cave was, where the 
land was^aa proper to both,, and where indeed there waa 
land enough ; however, irpoQ iecond thoughts, they aW 
tered one part of that resolution too, and relolvedonty 
jto remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part of 
their corn there ; and fo, if one part was deftroyed> the 
other might be faved : and one piece of prudence they 
ufed, which it was very well they did, viz. That they 
never trufted thefe three. fevages, which they had takeh 
prifoners, with knowing any thing of the plantation they 
had made in that valley, or of any cattTe thev ha4 
there ; much lefs of the cave;there, which they kept ill 
cafe of neceflity, as a fafe retreat ; and thither they car- 
zfed alfo the two barrels c^ powder, which I had left 
them at my coming away. 

But,, however, they rcfolved not ta change their ha- 
l^tation ; yet they agreed, that as I had ^carefiilly co» 
vered it firfi: with a wall or fortification, and.then witK 
a grove of frees ; fo, feeing their fafety confified en- 
tirely in their bein? concealed, of which they were now

the place yet more effectually than before : to this pur-

jthc tide ^owed, not fo much as leaving any place to 
land, or any iign that there had been any landing 
thereabouts ; thcfe flakes alfo, being of a wood very* 
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took 
care to have generaily very m«ch larger and taller Aan 
thofe whidi I had planted, and place<l them fo very thick 
and clofe, that when they ha4. been three or four years 
grown, there was no piercing with the eye any confide-' 
rablc way into the plantation ; as for tha^part which I 
had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man*a 
thigh ; and among them they placed fo many other fhort 
one^, and fo thick, that, in a word, it flood like a pall- 
fado a quarter of a mile thick, a»d it was next to im- 
pofiible to penetrate it, but with a Kttle army, to cut it 
all down ; for a little dog could hardly get between the 
trees, they ftood fo eioi'e. 

But tiiis was not all ; for they did the fame by all the 
ground to the right hand, and to the left, and round 
even to the top of the hill ; leaving no way, not fo 
much as for themfelves to come out, but by the ladder 
placed up to Jthe fide of the hill, and then lifted up, 
and placed again from the firfl dage up to the top ; 
which ladder, when it was t^en down, nothing but 
what had wings or witchcraft te aiSft k, could come at < 
them. 

This was excellently well contrived; nor Was it left 
than what they afterwards, found occafion for ; which 
ferved to convince me, that a^ human prudence has au- 
thority of proiadence to juflify it, fo it has, doubtlefs, 
the dire^ion of providence to let it to work; and, would 
we Uften carefully to the voice of it, I am fully perfuaded 
we might prevent many of the difafters which our Uvea 
are now by ottr own negligence fubjected to. But this 
by the way, 

I return to the flory : They lived two years after this 
in perfed retirement, and had no more yifits from the 
favages ; they had indeed, aft alarm given them one 
rooming, which put them in a great conflernation ; 
for, fome of the Spaniards being out early one

fear of being difcovere^, they were furprized with feeing^, 
above twenty canoes of Indians juftcpmifig on (hpre. 

They made the beft of their way home, in hurry 
enough ; and giving the alarm to their comrades, they 
kept clofe all that day and the next, going out only at 
night, to make obfervation : but they had the good luck 
«rbe miftaken ; for wherever the favages went, they 
did not land at that time on" the i{land« but parfued 
fome other defign. 

And now they had another broil with the three Eng- 
liflimen ; one of which, a moft turbulent fellow, being la- 
a rage at one of the three flaves, which I mentioned 
t^ey had taken,, bccaufe the fellow had not done fome- 
thing right which he bid him do, andfeemed a little un- 
tradable in his (hewing him, drew a hatchet out of a 
frog-belt, in which he wore it by his fide, and fell upoa ' 
the poor favage, not to correct him, but to kill him. 
One of the Spaniards, who was by,. feeing him give the 
fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed 
at his head, but ftnick into his fhoulder, fo that he 
thought he had (cut the poor creature's arm off, ran 
to him, and intreating him not to murder the poor man^ . 
clapt in between him and: the favage, to prevent the 
iBjfchief. 

• The fellow, being enraged the more at this, ftruck 
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and fwore he would ^ 
ferve him as he intended to ferve the lavage; which the 
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a 
(hovel, which he had in his hand (for they were work"* 
ing in the field about the corn-land) knocked the brute 
down : Another of the Etiglifhmen, running at the 
fame time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard 
down ; and then two Spaniards more came to help their 
man, and a third Englifhman fell upon them. They had 
non^of them any fire-arms, orany other weapons bnl*

the other two Englillimen, who were their countrymen.

When the SpaniiB governor heard this, he calls to-

m^ing a jeft of it, that,, hftd he not been held b)^ three

thought he would have attempted to have killed the 
Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This hair-brained carriage obliged them to confider fe- 

rioufly whatwas tobcdone. ThctwoEnglifhmenandthe 

S/fsajHfd, whg{kv€d chepoQV favage, wereof the opinion.

That they fhould hang one of the three for an example 
to the reft ; and that particularly it fhould be^he that 
had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, 
and indeed there was feme reafon to believe he had done 
it, f^r the poor favage was in fuch a miferable condition, 
with the wound he had received, that it was thought he 
could not live. 

Bat the governor Spaniard ftlll faid ; No, it was an 
.Engii(hman tjiat had faved all their lives, and he would 
never confent to put an Englishman to death, though he 
had murdered half of them; nay, he faid, if he had 
been killed himfelf by an Englifliiman, and had time left 
to f peak, it fhould be^ that they fhould pardon him. 

This was fo pofltivcly infifled on by the governor Spa- 
niard, that thetre was no gainfaying it ; and, as merciful 
councils areraoftapt to prevail, where they arefo ear- 
nefUy prefTed, fo they all came into it ; but then it was 
to be confidered^what fhould be done to keep them from 
the mifchief they defigned ; for all agreed, governor and 
all, that means were to be ufcd for preferving the fo- 
ciety from danger : After a long debate it was agreed, 
firft. That they fhould be difarmed, and not permitted 
to have either gun, or powder, or fhot, or fword, or any 
weapon, and &ould be turned out of the fociety, and 
left to liv« where they would, and how they could, by 
themfelves ; but that none of the refl, either Spaniards 
or Engliih, fhould converfe with them, fpeak with them» 
or have any thing to do with them ; that they fhould be 
f}rbid to come within a certain diitance of the place 
where the refl dwelt ; and that if they offered to com- 
mit any diforder^ foas to fpoil, bum, kill or defboy any 
of the corn , plan ting, buildings, fences, or cattle belong- 
ing to the fociety, that they fhould ^ie without mercy, 
and would fhootthem wherever they could find them. 

The- governor, a man of greathumanity, mufing up- 
on the fcntence, coniidered a^ittle upon it; and, turn- 
ing to the two honed Englilhman, faid, hold; you muil 
reflect, that it will be long ere they can raife corn and 
cattle of their own, and they rauft not fVarl^e : we mult 
therefore allow them provifions. So he caafed to be ad-

liave iiOQc of thefe tools or provifions, unlefs they would 
fwearfolemnly, thatthey would not hurt orinjure anydf

Thus they difmifTed them the fociety, and turned 
them out to fliift for thcmfelves. They went ^way 
fuUenanu ref^n^ry, as^eith^r contented to go away, 
or to ftay ; but, as there was no remedy, they went pre- 
tending to go and chufe a place where they ihould fet- 
tle themfelves, to plant, and live by themfelves i and 
ibme provificms were given, but no weapons; 

About four or ftve days after, they came again for 
fome viduals, and gave the governor an account where 
they had pitched their tents, and marked ourfelves out 
an habitation or plantation ; it was a very conveaient 
place indeed, on the remote^ part of the ifiand, N. £• 
much about the place where I providentially landed ia 
xny firil voyage, when I was driven out to fea, the Lord 
alone knows whither, in my fooliih attempt to furround 
theiiland. 

Here th^ built themfelves two handfome huts, and 
contrived them in a manner like my nril habitation, 
being clofe under the fide of a hill, having fome trees 
growing already to the three fides . of it : fo that by 
planting others, it wo\ild bb very eafily covered from 
the fight, unlefs narrowly fearched for ; they defired 
fome dry goat*&ins for beds and covering, which were 
given them ; and upon their eiving their words, that 
they would not difturb the relt, nor injure any of their 
plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what other 
tools they could ^are ; fome peafe, barley, and ric«, 
for fowing, and, in a wcrd, any thing they wanted, 
but arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this feparate condition about fix months, 

and had |orin their hrfl harveft, thotsgh the quantity 

was but Imall, the parcel of land they had planted be*

on, for want of a cave in the ealtii» they could not keep- 
their grain dry, and it was in great danger of fooiling r

%he Spaniards to help them, which they very readily Sidi 
and in four days worked a great hole in the fide of the 
hiii for them, bi^ enough to fecure their coii^ and 
other things from the rain ; but it was but a poor place 
at beft, compared to mine ; and cheekily as mine was 
then ; fin* the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and 
made feveral new apartments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this Reparation; 
SI new frolick took thefe rogues, which, together with 
the former villaiay they had convmitted, brought mif- 
chief enough upoh them, and had very near been the 
ruin of the whole colony ; the three new afibciates 
beean, it feems, to be weary of the laborious life they 
led, and that without hope of bettering their circum* 
fiances ; and a whim took them, that they would make 
a voyage to the Continent, from whence the favages 
came, and would try if they could ndt feize upon fome 
pnfoners among the natives there, and brmg them 
hoine, fo as to make them do the laborious part of the 
work for them. ^i 

The projedl was not fo pre^o»^erous, 4f they had gone 
no farther; but they did nothing, and propoied nothing

be under a blaft from heaven for $ if we will liot allow 
a vifible curie to purfue vifible crimes, how fhallwe re-

certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mjii'*

Jt was at lead forty miles broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have

too big for them to manage ; but as they had a fair

at their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to- 
fight them, they durft not go on fliore, but failed on to 
the northward 6 or 7 hours, till they came to a great 
opening, by which they perceived that the land they 
faw from oui? ifland was not the main, but an iiland ;. 
that entering, that opening of the fea, they faw another 
iiland on the right hand north, and fcveral more weft ; 
and, being refolved to land fomewherc> they put over to 
one- of the iilands which lay weft, and went boldly on

friendly to them, and they gave them feveral roots, and 
fome dried iiib, and appeared very ibciable ; and l^e 
women, as well as the men-, were very forward to fupply 
them with any thing they coutd get for them to eat, and 
brought it to them a great way upoa their hei^ds. 

They continued here four days, and encjoiredi ar

they feemed extremely pleaied with ; and then, tying 
the poor creatures hands behind them, they ( the people)

and f ubjefted creatures, rather like flaves than wives s 
but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, inge* 
jiious, or iuduftrious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another ob'ervation I muft make, to the honour of 
a diligent application on the one hand, and to the dif- 
grace of a flothful, negligent, idle temper on the other^ 
that when I came to the place, and viewed the feverai 
improvements, planting, and management of the feve«- 
ral little colonies; the two men had fo far outgone the 
^hree, that there was no comparifon : they had indeed

rule, nature dit^bated, and that it was to ncypurpofe to toWh 
more corn than they wanted ; but the difterence of the 
cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed 
every thing elfe, was eafy to be feen at firft view, 
• The two men had innumerable young trees planted 
dtbout their huts, that when you came to the place, no- 
thing was to be feen but a wood ; and though they had 
their plantation quite demolifhed, once by their own 
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as (hall be ftiewli 
in its place ; yet they had reftored all again, and every 
thing was flouriHiing and thriving about them ; they had 
grapes planted in order, any managed like a vineyard, 
though they had themfelves never feen any thing of that 
kind ,* and by their good ordering their vines, their 
grapes were as good again as any of the others. They 
had alfo fcnrmed themfelves a retreat in the thickeft paart 
of the woods, where, though there was not a natural 
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incefTant 
labour of, their hands, and where, when the mifchief 
which followed happened,: they fecured their wives and 
children, fo as. thev could never be found : they having 
by fUcking innumerable ftakes and poles of the wood, 
which, as I faid, gre^ fo eafily, made a grove impafTa- 
ble, except in one place, where they climbed up to get 
over the oat€de part ; and then went in by ways of their 
#wn leaving. 

As t» the three reprobates, as 1 juftly call them, tho** 
they were much civilized by-theirnew fettlement, com* 
pared to what they were before, and were not fo quasv 
reifcnne, having not the fame opportunity, yet one of 
the certain companions of a profligate mind nevej left 
them, and that was their idlenefs ; it is true,* they 
planted corn, and made fences ; but Solomon's words 
were never better verefied than in them 5 * Iwent by the 
vineyard of the (lothful, and it was overgrown with 
thorn ; * for when the Spaniards came to view their crop, 
they could not fee it in fome places for weeds; the hedge 
had feveral gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten 
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a 
dead bufh was crammed in, to ftop them out for the 
prefent, but it was only fhutting the ftable-door after the 
^cd was ftolen ; whereas, when they looked on the 

colony 



iLbtlKSOK C&trSOE. 7t 

iColony of the other two, there was the rery face of ia-« 

duOry and fuccefs upon all they did ; there irzs not i, 
weed to be fcen in all their corn, or a gap in any of 
their hedges : and they, on the other hand, verified So- 
lomon's words in anotner place : * TKe diligent hand 
«maketh rich ;* for every thing grew and thrived, and 
they had plenty within and without ; they had more 
tame cattle than the other, more utenlils and necelTarics 
within doors, and yet more pleafure and diverfion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were, very handy and 
cleanly within doors ; and, having learned the Englifh 
ways of drefling and cooking from one of the other £n- 
glifhmen, who, as I faid, was a cook's mate on board 
the fhip,they drcfled their hulband's victuals very nice- 
ly ; 'whereas the other could not be brought to under- 
itandit^ but then the hufband, who, as I ^id, had been 
cook's mate, did it himfelf ; but, as for the hufbands 
of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles 
eggs, and caught fifli and birds : in a word, any thing 
but labour ; and they fared accordingly. The diligent 
lived well and comfortably, and the flochful lived hardf 
and beggarly ; and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it 
IS all over the world. 

But now I come to a fcene, different from all that had 
liappened before, either to them or me, and the origin 
of the (lory was this : 

Early one morning there came on ihore five or fix 
canoes of Indians, ^ or favages, call them which you 
pleafe ; and there is no rcom to doubt that they came 
upoif the old errand of feeding upon their flaves ; but 
that part wa« now fo familiS" to the Spaniards, and to 
our mea too, that they did not concern themfelves about 
It, as I did J but, having been made fenfible by their 
experience, that their only bufinefs was to lie concealed, 
and that, if they were not feen by any of the favages, 
fhey would go off again quietly, when their bufinefs was 
clone, having as yet not the leaft notion of there being 
any inhabitants in the ifiand ; I fay, having been. made- 
fcnlible <if this, they had nothing to no but to give no- 
tice to all the three plantations to keep within doors, 
and not to ihew themfclvesj only placing a fcout in a

proper plsicc* to give notice when the boats ^cnt off to 
lei again. 

This \vas, without doubt, very right ; but a difafler 
fpoUed all thefe meafures, and made it known among 
the favages, that there were inhabitants there ^ which 
was, in the end, the defolation of almoft the whole co* 
lony . After the canoes with the favages were gone off, 
the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and fome of them, 
had the curiofity to go to the jplace where they hi^d been, 
to fee what they bad been doing. Here, to their great 
furprize, they found three favages left behind, and ly- 
ing faft afleep upon the ground ,• it was fuppofed, they 
had either been fo gorged with their inhuman feafl, that 
like beafts, they were afleep, and would not Hir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the woods, 
jand did not come back m time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were grieatly furprized at this light, 
and perfectly at a lofs what to do ; the Spaniard governor 
as it happened, was with them, and his advice was alli- 
ed, but he profelfed he knew not what to do j as for 
Haves they had enough already ; and as to killing them, 
they were none of them inclined to that ; the Spaniard 
governor told me they could not think of fliedding in- 
nocent blood ; for, as to them, the poor creatures had 
done no wrong, invaded none of their property ; and 
they thought they had no juft quarrel with them, to 
take away their lives. 

And here I muft, in juftice to thtefe Spaniards, obferve, 
that let all the accounts of Spaniih cruelty in Mexico 
and Peru be what they will, I never met with (ev^teen 
mcH, of any nation whatfoever, in any foreign country, 
who were to univerfally mpdeft, temperate, virtuous, 
fo very good-humoured, and fo courteous, as thefe 
Spaniards; and, as to cruelty, they had nothing of it 
in their very nature ; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no 
outrageous paffions, and yet all of them men of great 
courage and fpirit. 

Their temper and calmnefs had appeared in their 
bearing the unfufferable ufage of the three Engliihmen, 
and their juftice and humanity appeared now in the 
cole of tht favageS) as above : after fome confultation

It was very happy t6 thetn, ttiat they did not cai*ry 
them home to their caftle ; I mean- to my palace under the 
hill ; but they carried them firft to the bower, wiiefe wai 
the chief of their country work; fuch as the keeping the 
goats, the planting the corn, &c. and afterwards they 
carried them to the habitation of the two Englifhmen. 
Here they were :^t to work, though it was notmucli

the place in the wood, where their wives were fcnt 
keepings" at a diftance; yet fo that they might f«e, if 
pollible, which w^ay the farages tock. 

They had not gone far, but. that, from a rifing 
ground, ihey could fee the little army of their enemies 
come on directly to their habitation, &Ad in a moment 
more could fee all their huts and houfhold-ftuff flaming 
up together, to their great grief and mortification; for 
they had a very great lofsr and to them irrctriveable, 
at lead for fome time. They kept their ftution for 
awhile, till they found the favages, like wild beafts, 
fpread themfelves^ll over the placfc, rummaging every 
way, and every place they could think of, in fearch for 
prey; and,, in particular, for the people, of whom it • 
plainly appeared they had intclligeiice. 

The two Englifhmcn feeing this, thinking themfelves 
ftct fecure where they flood, becaufe, as It was likely 
fomc of the wild people m'!ght come jhiat way, (o they 
might come too many together, thought it proper to 
make another retreat about half a mile farther, believe- 
ing, as it afterwards happened, that thq farther they 
ftrolled,the fewer would be together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very thick 
grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of 
a tree itood, which was hollow, and vallly large; and 
io this tree they both took their {landing, refolving to 
fee what might oftcri 

They had not Hood there long>but two of the favages 
appeared running dircdlly that way, as if they had already 
notice where they flood, and were coming up to attack 
them; apd a little way further they ' efpitd three more 
coming after them.and five. morebeyond them,all coming 
the fame way; befides which, thejr faw feven or eight more 
at a diftance, running another way; for, in a word, they 
ran every way, like fportfmen beating for their game. 
The poor men were now iiLgreat perplexity, whether 
they (hould ftand, and keep their poflure, or fly: but after 
a very fliort debate with themfelves, they confidered, that 
if the favages ranged the country thus, before help came#

ed not to aefend themfelvcs, fire excepted, as long as 
their ammunition lafted, tho* all tjie faveges that were 
landed, which were near fifty, were to attack them,

the two firft paf^by, unlefs they fhould fpy thein in the 
trtee, and come to attack them The two firft favages alfo 
confirmed them in this refolution, by turning a little from 
them towards another part of the wood ; but the three, 
and the five after them, came forwards diredbly to the 
tree, as if they had known the Eftgliihmen were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftrait towards them, they re- 
fblved to take them in a line as they came ; and as they 
refblved to fire but one at a tim^ perhaps the firft Ihot 
naight hit them all three; to which purpofe, the man 
who was to fire, p\A three or four bullets into his piece, 
and having a fair loop hole, as it were, from a broken 
hole in the tree, he took a fure aim, without bein^g 
fecn, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of 
the tree, fo that he could not mifs. 

While they were thus waiting, and the lavages came

for, the favages kept near one another, a little behind

they could, they rcfolvcd to march to that part of the 
ifland where the favages were fled, and fee what pofture 
they were in. Thi$ neceiTarily led them over the place- 
where the fight had been, and where they found fevcral 
of the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet paft reco- 
vering life ; a fight difagreeable enough to generous 
minds ; for irtruly great man, tho' obliged by the law of 
battle to deilroy his enemy, takes no delight in his mifery.. 

However, there was no need togivc any order in thiT 
cafe ; for their own favajjes who were their fervants, 
difpatched thofe poor creatures yriih their hatchets. » 

At length they came in view of the place where the 

more miferable remains of the fava^s army lay, where 

^ thiwqp appeared about i co ftill ; their poft^re was gene* 

^r ^ is0y fitting lipon the ground, .with their, knees up tor 

wards their mouth, and the head put between the 

hands, leaning down upon the knees- 

When our men came within two mufquet-fhot -of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mufquets to 
be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that- 
by their countenance he might know wliat to expeft,- 
VIZ. Whether they were ftill in heart to fight, or were^ 
fo heartily beaten, as to be difpirited and difcouraged, 
4nd (6 he might manage accordingly. 

This flratagem took ; for, as foon as the favages heard 
the firfi; gun, and law the fiafh of the fecond, they« 
fiarted up upon their feet in the greateil confternation: 
imaginable ; and, as our men advanced fwiftly toward$t~ 
them, they all ran fcrcaming and yawling away^with a: 
kind 'of ah howling noife, which our men jdid not un- 
derhand, and had never heard before, and thus they/ 
ran up the hills into the country. 

At firft, our men had much rath er„ the weather had^ 
been calm, and they had all gone away tofca : but they 
did not then corifider, that this might probably have been* 
the occafionof their toming again in fuch multitudes a$r 
not to be refilled ; or, atleaft, to come fo many and {(y, 
often, as would quite defolate the ifland, and ttarve them : , 
Will Atkins therefore, who, notwithflandiughis wound^ 
kept always with themj proved the befl counfellorin this; 
ca<e . his advice was, to take the advantage that offer- 
4r^ and dap in between them and their bofts i^^r 



lb dq)rive them of the capacity of ever retorning jiny 
more to plague the ifland. , 

They confulted long about this, and fomc were 
HgdBft it, for fear of making the wretches fly into the 
woods, and live there defperate; and fo they Should 
liave them to hunt like wild beajd, be afraid to iltir abou( 
their bufinefs, and have their plantation continually 
rifled, all their tame goats deftroyed, and in (hort, b^ 
Teduced to a life of continual diflrefs. 

Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do with 
100 men, than with loo nations ; that as they mufl de- 
iftroy their boats, {o they muft dellroy the men, or be all 
<of them deftroyed themfelves. Ina word, he fhcwed them 
the neeeflity of it fo plainly, that they all came into it; 
fo they went to work immediately with the boats, and, 
getting fome dry wood together from a dead tree, they 
tried to fet fome of them on fire; but they were fo wet^ 
that they would fcarceburn.Hovvevtr, the fire fo burned 
the upper part, that it foon made them unfit for fwinj- 
ming in the fea as boats. When the Indians fa w what 
they were about, fome of them came running out of th^ 
woods; andy coming as near as they could to our men, 
kneeled down and cried, Oa, Oa, War^mokoa, and fome 
other words of their langnage, which none of the others 
iinderflood any thing of; but as they made pitiful gcf- 
tures, and flrangc noifes, itwas eafyto underfl and they 
begged to have their boats fpared, and that they woul4 
be gone, and never come thither again » 

But our men were now fatbfied, that they had no way 
to preferve themfelves, or to fave thlir colpny, but ef- 
fedtually to prevent any of thefe people froni ever going 
liome aeain; depending updn this, that if ever fo much 
as one of them got back into their country to tell the 
fliory, the colony was undone: fo that, letting them 
Icnow that they fhould not have any mercy, they fell tq 
work, with their canoes, and deftroyed them evei^ one^ 
that the ftortn had notdeilroyed before; at th^ fight o| 
which the favages raifed a hideous cry in the woqds^ 
"which our people heard plain enough ; after which they, 
*an about the if?and like diftra<fted men; fo that, in » 
word, our men did not really know at firft what to da

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, confi- 
dcr, that while they made thofc people thus defperatc, 
they ought to have Iccpt good guard at the fame time 
tipon their plantations ; ibr tho' it is true they had driven 
ftway their cattle, and the Indians did not find their 
main retreat, I mean my old caftle at the hill, nor the 
cave in the valley ; yet they found out my plant^ion at -" 
the bower, and pulled it all to-picces, and all the fences 
and planting about it ; trod all the corn under foot ; tore 
top the vines and grapes, beingjuft then almofl ripe; and 
did our men an inefhmable damage, tho' to themfclves, 
toot one farthing's worth of fcrvice. 

Tho' our men were able to fight them Upon all oc- 
cafions, yet they were in no condition to purfue them, 
or hunt them up and down ; for as they were too nimble 
«f foot for #ur men when they found them fingle, fo 
cur men durft not go about fingle, for fear of being fur- 
rounded with their numbers : the beft was, they had no 
weapons; for tho' they, had bows, they had no arrows 
left, nor any ;naterials to make any, nor had they any 
tdged tool or weapon amon;g them* 

The extremity and diftrefs they were reduced to was 
^eat, and indeed deplorable, but at the fame time our 
fnen Were alfo brought to rery hard circumftances by 
them ; for tho* their retreats were preferved, yet their 
provtfion was deftroyed, and thett harveft fpoiled ; and 
what to do, ot which way to turnthemfelves,thev knew 
not : the only refuge they had now. Was the ttock of 
C9itt\t they had in the valley by the cave, and fomc 
iittle c^rn which grew there. The three Englifiimen^ 
William Atkins, and his comrades,^ were now reduced 
to tvird, one of them beihg killed by an arrow, which 
, ftruck him on the fide off fais head, juft under the tern* 
f les, fo that he never fpoke more ; and it was vei-y re- 
toarkable, that this was the fame barbarous fellow who 
cut the poor favage ilave with his hatchet, and who 
stfterWards intended to have murdered the Spaniards. 

I looked upon therr cafe to have been worfe at thi$ 

tlrne thaft mine was at any time after I firft difcoverei 

<hfe grahxs of barley and rice, and got into the method 

of phtnting and ndfing my cofn, and my tame cattle ;

The firft thing they concluded, when they (kw ffhait 
their circumftancef were, wa«, that they would, if pof- 
£ble, drive them up to the farther part of the iiland, 
fouth-ead, that if any more favages come on (hore, they 
might not find one aivKher ; then, thatthey would daily 
hunt and harrafs them, and kill as many of them as they 
could come at, dll they.ind reduced their number; and 
if they could at laft tame them, and bring them to any 
thing, they would give them com, and teach diem how 
to plaqi and live upon their daily hibour. 

In order to this, they foHowedthem, and fo terrified 
them with their gnat* that in &hw days, if any of them 
fired a gun at an Inaian, if he did not hit kim, yet be 
rwould Ml down for itinr ; and {o dreadfoUy frighted 
they were, that they Jcept uut of fig]|t father and far-

propofed, if poffible, to take one of them alive, and

able to ad as interpreter, and to go among them, and 
fee if they might be bionght to fome conditions, that 
tni|^t i>e depended upon to fave their lives, and to do 
&s no fpoil. « 

It was fome time before any of them could be taken; 
but, being weak aarkl half-fiarved, one of thcrti was at lad 
Turprifed and made a prifoner ; he was fullen at ftrft, a Ad 
•would neither eat nor drink ; but finding himfelf kindly

triumphal unnatural fcafts ; but as they were of fcveral 
. nation«, and, perhaps, had never heard of thofc that 
came before, or the rcafoa of it, they did not make any 
fearch or enquiry after their country men ; and if they 
had, it would have been very hard for. them to have 
found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full abcount of all that 
happened to them, to my return, at- leafl, that was 
worth notice* The Indians, pr favages, were wonder- 
fully civilized by them,iandthey frequently went amoilg 
^em; but:forbid, on pain of dea^h, any of the Indians 
x^^ing to them, b^caufe they would not have their ^- 
- Uement betrayed again. ./ 

One thing was very remarkable, viz. that th<y taught 
the ravages to make wicker*work, or baikets ; but thoy 
. foon out-did their mafters; for they viade abundance ihF 
' inoft innnious things in wicker-work;, particularly^ a:ll 
^ ibrts orbaikets, fieves, bird cage^, cupboards, (kc^iiis 
' alfp chairs to fit on, ilpols,jbeds,. couches, and abilB- 
V dance of other things, being very ipgenious.at fuch 
v^rk, when diey were once put in the way of it. 
My coming was a particular relief to thefe peeple, 
: became we furnifhed th^m with knives, fcifiars, fpadea 
Ihovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind whkh 
: they could want. >> 

With the help of thefc tools they were fo very han- 
. dy, that they came, at lafl, to build up their hut9>. or 
houfes, very hahdfomely; raddling, or worUng it up 
like baiket work all the way round, which was a very 
extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd ; 
but was an exceeding good fence, as well again(t heat, 
as againft all forts of vermin ; and our men were fo tajkf n 
with it, that they got the wild favages to come and do 
the like for them: fo that when I come to fee the two 
Engliftmen's colonies, they looked, at a difVance, asjif 
they lived all like bees in a hive; and as for Will ,Atkif>s> 
, who was now become a very induftrious, neceflary, and 
fober fellow, he had made himfelf fuch a tent of.baf- 
ket-work, as I believe was never feen; itwas 120 paces

5^4 ADVENTURES OF 

Hke* thtir mothers. There were itotleof tho(e chil^reii : 
aboye fix years old when I catne thither; for it was not 
much above fevcn years that th^y had fetched thefe five \ 
favage Indies, pver, biii they had all been pretty fruitful, 
for they had all children, more or lefs: 1 think the 
cook's mate's wife was big of her fixth child; and the J 
mothers were all a good ion of well governed, quiet, 
laborious women, paadeft and decen t, helpful to one an- ] 
other, mighty observant and fphjecSl to their mailers* I '^ 
cannot call them hufbands; and wanted nothing but to J 
be wellinftro^ed in the: ChriHian religion, and to be j 
legally married; both which were fcappily brought ^ 
about afterwards by my means, or, at leait, by the con* . ' 
iequence of my coming ambn^ them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in gene- 
rals and pretty much of my five runagade EngliihBien, I 
mvA fay fcMnetluag of the Spaniards, who were the main 
bpdy of the family; and in whofe flory there are feme 
iaqi4eiits alfo remarkable enough. - 

I had a gre^c many difcourfes with them about their 
q'lrcumitances, when they were among the favages ; they 
t^ldme readily, that they had nojnftaaces to give of 
their application .or ingennit}^ in that country; that they 
were a poor, miferable dejedted handful of people; that 
if Bieanis had been put into their handsi they had yet fo 
abandoned themfelves to de%air, and fo {unk under the -- 
weight of their misfortunes, that ifc'e^- thought of nothing 
but flfarving: one of them, agr|^ and very fenfxblc 
man* told me, he was convinced they were in the wrong; 
that it was not thie part of wife men to give up them- 
felves to their mifery, but always to take hold of the 
belps which reafbn offered, as well for prefent fupport, 
ts rotfiiture deliverance ; he told me, that grief was 
the moft fenfelcft infignifidint piafiion in the world; for 
that it regarded only things pafl, which were generally 
impoffible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had^ no 
view to things to come, and had no (hare in any thing . 
that looked Tike deliverance, but rather added, to the 
wB!^€dim than propoied a remedy: and upon this, he 
repeated a Spanilh proverb; which, tho* I cannot repeat 
in jttft the fame words that he fpoke it, yet I remember 
I made it imxi an Engliih prorcFb of my own thus :

dition> which^ in'its circuraltance, wis at ^rfl much' 
worfc than theirs, a thoufand times more happy than 
theirs was, even now, when they were altogether : htt 
to\A me, it was remarkable, that Endiflimen had a 
greater prefence of mind, in' their dilcrefs, than any 
people that ever he met with; that their unhappy na- 
tion, and the Portug^cfc, were the worft men in the 
world to ilruggle with misfortunes; for that their firft 
ftep in danger, after common efforts are over, was al- 
ways to defpair, lie down under it and die, witllout-rauf- [ 
ing thnr thoughts up to proper remedies for cfcapc. 

I told him, their cafe and mine differed exceedingly ; 
that they were caft upon the fhore without neceffanes, 
without fupply of food, or of jjrefent fuftenance, till 
tbey could provide it: that it is true, I had this dif- 
advantage and difcom fort, that I was alone; but then 
thetupplies I had providentially. thrown into my hauds« 
by the uneipeAed driving of the fhip on fhore. was 
fuch a help as wonld have encouraged any creature iii 
the world to have applied himfdf as I had done: 
Seignior, fays the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards 
btfcn in ^our cafe, we (hould never hare gotten half 
th(^ things out of the (liip as you did: nay, fays he, 
we ihoold never have found means to have gotten a 
raft to carry them, or to have gotten a raft on fhore 
without boat or fail; and how much lefs fhould we' 
bkrfc done, fajid j)e, if any of us had been alone ! Well, 
I dcfircd him to abate his compliment, and go on witn 
the hiftory of their coming on (hore, where they landi

Hrhere there were people' without provifions; whereasi

where turtle and lea fowls whene in fuch plenty, that 
they could have been in no want of fleOi, though they

talned with a few roots and herbs, which ihey und;er*

wiiich the inhalntants gave them fparingly enough, and 
who could treat them no better, unlefs they would tufn 
cambats, and eat men's £[elh, which was the great dainty 
of the country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they ftrove 
to civilize the favages they were with, and to teach thent 
rational cuiloms in the ordinary way of living, but in 
vain ; and how they retorted it upon them, as UBJuft, 
that they, who came thither for afliHance and fupport^ 
fhould attempt to fet up for inflrudors of thofe that gavo 
them bread ; intimating, it feems,^ that none fhould fet 
up for thein{h:u6i:ors ofotbers, but thofe who could Uve 
without them. 

The V gave me difmal accounts of the extremities they 
were driven to ; how fometimes they were many days 
without any food at all ; the ifknd they were y^en being 
inhabited by a fort of favages that Hved more indolent, 
and, for that reafon, were left fupplied with the neccf- 
faries of life, than they had reafon tO: believe others 
were in the fame part of the world;' and. ye^ they found 
that thefe favages were lefs ravenous and voracious^ 
than thefe who had better fupplies of food. 

Alio they added, that th<^y could not but fee with 
ivhat demonflratibns of wifdom and goodnefs, the go^ 
verning Providence of God dired^s the event of thingf 
in the world ; which, they faid, appeared in their cir* 
cumftauces ; for if, preifed by the hardfhips they were 
under, and the barrennefs of the country where they 
were, they had fearched after a better place to live in, 
^diey had then been out of the way of the relief tha^

only to their friends, but have made themfelves terrible 
bodi to friends and enemies; but being without powder 
and fhot, and yet in a rendition, that they could not in 
reafon deny to go out with their l^vndlords to their wars ; ^ 
when they came in the field of battle, they were in a 
worfe condition than the favages themfelves ; for they 
neither had bows nor arrows, nor could they ufe thofe 
the favages gave them ; fo that they could do nothing 
but (land dill, and be wounded with arrows, till they 
came up to the teeth of their enemy ; and then, indeed, 
the three halberts they had« were of uie to them^ and 
they would often drive a whole little army before them, 
ivith thofe halberts and (harrened flicks put into the 
muzzles of their mu(kets: but that for all this they 
were fbmetimes forrounded with multitudes, and in great 
danger from their arrows; till at lall they found the way 
to make themfelves large targets of wood, which they 
covered with ikins of wild beads, ^hofe names they 
, knc^w not ; and thefe covered them from the arrows f>£ 
the favages ; that, notwiihil^nding thefe, they were 
fometimes in great danger, and were once £ve of them 
knocked dcwn together, with the clui^s of the favages, 
which was the time when one of them was taken pri«.

That at firfl they thought he had been killed, but when 
afterwards they heard he was taken prifoner, they were 
under the greatefl grief imaginable, and would willing-

Th^y tcld me, that when they were fo knocked down, 
the reft of their company refcued them, and flood over

They defcribed moft afFeflionately, how tlicy were 
fflrprifcd with joy it the return of their friend' and 
■companion in mifery. Who they thought had been de- 
voured by wild beads of the worft kind, viz. by wild 
men ; and, yet how more and more they were furprifed 
with the account he gave them of his errand, and that 
there was a Chriftian in a place near, much more one 
that was able, and had humanity enough to contribute, 
to their deliverance. 

They defcribed how they were aftoniftied at the fight 
fif the relief I lent them, and at the appearance of 
loaves of bread, things they had not feen fince their 
coming to that miferable place; how often they crofted 
it, and blefled it as bread Tent from heaven ; and what 
a reviving cordial it was to their fpirits to tafte it ; as alfo 
of the other things I had fcnt for their fupply. And, 
after all, they would have told me fomething of the 
joy they were in, at the iight of a boat and pilots to 
carry them away to the perfon and place, from whence 
all thefe new comforts came ; but they told me, it was 
impbflible to exprefs it by words ; for their excelTive 
joy driving them to unbecoming extravagancies, they 
had tio way to deicribe them, but by telling me, that 
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent 
to their paflion, fuitable to the fenfe that was upon them; 
that^ in fbihe it worked bne way, and in Tome another ; 
and Uiat fome of them, through a furprife of joy, would 
burft out into tears ; others be half-mad, and others irn- 
mediately faint. This difcourfe extremely afFefted me, 
and called to my mind Friday's extacy, when he met 
his father, and the poor people's extacy, when I took 
them up at fea, after their Ihip was on fire j the mate of 
the ihip's joy, when he found himfelf delivered in the 
place, -where hi expeded toperifti; and my own joy, 
When, after twenty-eight years captivity' I found a good 
ihip ready to carry nie to my own country: All thefc 
things made me more fenfible of the relation of thefe 
poor men, and more affefted with it. 

Having thiis given a view of the ftate of things, 
as I found them, I muft relate the heads of what I did 
for thefe people, and the condition in which I left them. 
It was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be 

troubled

troablfe«r*no more with the favages ; or that, if they 
were, they would be able to cut them off, if they were 
twice as many as before ; fb that they had no concern 
about that. Then I entered into a feriou^ difcdurfe 
with the Spaniard, whom 1 called governor, about their 
ftay in the iiland ; for, as I was not cpme to carry any 
of them off, fo it would not be juft to carry off fome, 
and leave others, who perhaps, would be unwilling to 
llay, if their ilrength was diminifhed. 

On the other hand, I told them, I came to ellablifh 
them there, not to remove them ; and then I let them 
know, that I had brought with me relief of fundry kinds 
for them : That I had been at a great charge to fiipply 
them with all things neccffary ; as well for their con- 
venience, as their defence ; and that I had fuch par- 
ticular perfons with me, as well to increafe and recruit 
their number, as by the particular neceflary employ- 
ments which they were bred to, being artificers, to 
aflift them in thofe things, in which, at prefent, they 
were to feek. 

They Were all together when I talked thus to them ; 
and before I delivered to them the ftores I had brought, I 
a&ed them, one by*one, if they had entirely forgot and 
buried the firft animofities that had been among them, 
and could ihake hands with one another, and engage in 
a ftrid friendiKip, and union of iiuereft, fo that there 
might be no more mifunderltandings or jealouiies. 

William Atkins, with abundance of franknefs and 
good humour, faid. They had met with affli6lk>ns 
enough to make them all fober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends : That, for his part, he would 
live and die with them ; and was fo far from defigning 
any thing againft the Spaniards, that, he owned, they 
bad done nothing to him but what his own bad .ha«« 
mour m^de necefi'ary, and what he would have done, 
and, perhaps, much worfe, in their cafe ; and that he 
would afk them pardon, if I defired it, for the foolifli 
and brutilh things he had done to them ; and was very 
willing and deiirous of living in terms of entire friend- 
Ihip and union with them ; and would do any thing 
that lay in his power to convince them of it: and as ^ 
for going to England, he cared not if he did not go 
thitiier thefe twenty years. 



loo A^VtNTfJRES OF 

The Spaniards h\d, they had, indeed, at kr!k, dif- 
armed and excluded William Atkins, and his tWo coun- 
ty men, for their ill condu^, as they had let me know: 
and they appealed to me ior the aeceffity they were 
under to do fo ; but that William Atkins had behaved 
liimfelfib bravely in the great fight they had with the 
iavages, andon ieveral occaiioas Itnce, and had ihewed 
bimielf io faichial to, and concerned for the general in- ^ 
terefi of them ail, that they had forgotten ail that was 
pall ; and thonghthe merited as much to be trufled with 
arms, and fupplied with neceflaries, as any of them ; 
and that they had teftified their faci^fadtion in him, by 
commiting the command to him", next to the governor 
hlmfelf : and as they had an entire confidence in him, 
and all his countrymen, fo they acknowledged, tfiey 
had merited that con^dence, by all the methods that 
honcft men could n^rit to be valued and trufted^: and 
they moil heartily embraced the occafion of giving me 
this afTurancs, that they woald never have any intereft 
feparate from one another. 

Upon thefe frank and open declarations of firiend- 
(hip, we appointed the next day to dine all together; 
And indeed, we made a fplendid feaA : 1 caufed the 
fhip*9 cookf and his mate to come on fhore, and dreis 
our dinner ; and the old cook's mate we had on fhore, 
a^f&Iled. We brought on fhore fix pieces of good beef, 
and four pieces of pork, out of the fhip's provifion, 
vyith our punch bowl, and materials to fill it ; and, in 
particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, 
and ten bottles of Englifh beer ; things that neither the 
Spaniards or the Englifhmen had tailed for many 
years ; and which it may be fuppofed, they were ex- 
ceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feafl five whole kids« 
which the cooks roalled ; and three of them were fent 
covered up clofe on board our fhip to the feamen, that 
they might feaH on frefh meat from on ihore, as we did 
with their fait meat from on board. 

After this feafl, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that 
there mi^ht be no difpute about dividing, I ihewed them 
there was fufficient for them all ; and defired, that they 

might 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. io« 

might all cake an equal quantity of the goods that were 
for wearing ; that is to fay» equal when made up. As 
firft, I diflribmed linen fufficienC:to make every one of 
them four ihirts ; and, at the Spaniard's requelt, after- 
wards piade them up fix; thefe were exceedingly comfort- 
able to them, having beei^ what, as I may fay, they had 
long iincc forgot the ufe of, or what it was to wear them. 

1 allotted the thin Eng^iOi ftuffr, which I mentioned 
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock. 
which f judged fxtteft for the heat of the ftafon, cool 
and loofe ; and ordered that \vhcnevcT they decayed, 
they fhould make mere, as ihey thought fit s The like 
for pumps, (hoes, {lockings and hats, Sec, 

I cannot exprefs what pleafure, what fatisfaflion, fat 
upon the countenances of all thefe poor men, when they 
faw the care I had taken of them » and hdw well I had 
furniihed them : they told me, I was a father to them : 
and that, having fuch a correfpondent as I was, in fo (^ 
mote a part of the world, it wodd make them forget 
that they were left in a defolate place : and they all 
volumarily engaged tt> me« not to leave the place with- 
out my confent. 

Then 1 prefcnted to them the people I had brought 
with me ; particularlv the taylbr, the fmtth, and th« 
two carpenters, all of them moft neceiTary people ; but» 
above all, my general artificer, than whom they coold 
pot name any thing that was more needful to them; and 
tile taylor, to (hew his concern for them« weitt to work 
immediately, and* with my leave, made ^hem every 
one a fhirt the fii^ thing he did ; and> which was ftiU 
more, he taught the women not only how to.few and 
flitch, and ufe the needle, but made them afiil to make 
the Qklrtt for their hnibands, and for all the reft. 

As lor the carpenters, I jG:arce need mention how ufe* 
iy they were, for they took in pieces idl my clamfy un- 
handy dlings, and made them clever convenient tables, 
fboh, bedfeads, cupboard' » lockers^ flielves, and every 
^ing they wanted oif that kind. 

But, to let them fee how nature made artificers at Arft, 

Icariled the carpenters to fee William Atkins's bafket*

b*ut give him tools. 

Then I brought them out all my flore of tools, and 
gave every man a digging- fpade, a (hovel, and a rake^ 
for we had no harrows, or ploughs ; and, to every fe- 
parate place, a pickaxe, a crow, a^broadaxe, and a faw ; 
always appointing that as often as any were broken, or 
worn out, they fhould be fupplied, without grudging, 
out of the general Hores that 1 left behind. 

Nails, llaples, hinges, hammers, chiiTels, knive$, 
fciiTars, and all forts of tools, and iron -work, they had 
without tale, as they required j for no man would care 
to take more than he wanted ; and he muA be a fool 
that would waile or fpoil thenii on any account whatr 
foever: And, for the ufe of the fmith, I le/t two tow 
of un wrought iron for a fupply. 

My magazine of powder and arms, which' I brought 
rhem, was fuch, even to profufion, that they could not 
but rejoice at them ; for now they could march as I ufcd

And now the other two Englifhmen removed their habi-

into three colonies, and no more, viz. the Spaniards with 
old Friday, and the firli (ervants, at my old habitation

and where they had To enlarged and extended their works^ 
as'V^ell under, as on the outiide of the hill, that the/ 
lived, tho* perfcdly concealed, yet full at large. Never 
was their fuch a Httle city in a wood, and fo hid, I be*

if they had not known there was fuch a thing, and lookad 
OB purpofe fbr it, they would not have found it ; for the

the water's edge, on the fide of the creek ; and it was 
a^rwards abbve^oo yards to the place ; and the other 
was up the ladder at tMice, as I have already formerly 
deicribed it ; and they had a large wood, thick planted,, 
alfo, on the top of the hili, which contained above aa 
acre, which grew apace, and covered the place from all 
difcovery there, with only one narrow place between two

And now I fpeak of marrying, it brings me naturlally

I told him his carriage wasi h modeft, that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was uue, we wero 
(bch people as they call hereiics ; but, that he was 
Aot the firfl Catholic that I had converfed with» with-* 
out falling into any loconveniencies, or carrying the 
queilions to any height in debate ; that he (hould not 
fi^d himfelf the worfe ufed for beflt^ of a diferent opi<* 
nion (fom us r and if we did not converfe without any 
diilike on either iide, upon tharicore» it would be his 
fault, not ours. 

He replied; that he thought our conrerfation might 
be eafily feparated irom difputes ; that it was not hh 
builnefs to cap principles with every man he difeourfed 
with ; and that he rather defired me to converfe with 
him as a gemleman, than as a^^eiij^ieux; that if I wouM 
give him ieave, at any timcj to difcotHrfe upon reh'gious 
i'ubje^.S he would readily comply with it ; and that 
then he did not doubt but I would allow him alio to 
defend his own opinions, as well as he could: but that, 
without my leave, he would not break in upon mp with 
any fuch things 

He told me farther, that he woudd not eeafe to do at! 
that became him in his ofBce, as a prieih as well as a 
private ChriAian, to procure the good of the ihip, ar>4 
the faf ety of all that was in her : and though, perhapsg, 
we would not join with him, aad he could aot pray with 
us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would d« 
upon all occafions, in this manner we converfed ; and, 
as he was of a moft obliging gent leman*l ike behavioej;^ 
fo he was, if I may Le allowed to fay fo, a man of 2o«4 
ienfe« and, as I. believe, of great learning*

to the place whither any of the (hips he was in, wert 9$. 
firfl defigned : that his firli intent was, to have gone to 
Martinico ; and that he went on board a ihip bound 
thich(?r,at St.Maloes; but. being forced into Lifbon in 
bad weather, the (hip received ibme damage^by running 
aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was ob? 
liged to unload her cargo there : That finding a Poriu- 
guefe fhip there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to failv 
and fuppoiing he fhould eafily meet with a veflel there* 
boand to Martinico, he went on board, ia order to fail to 
the Madeira^! ; but the Matter of the Portuguefe ihip 
being but an indifferent niariner^ had been out in his 
reckoning, and they drove to Fial ; where, however, he 
happened to find a very good market for his cargo, 
which was corn ; and therefore reiblved not to go to the 
Madeiras, but to load fait at the Ifle of May, to go away 
to Newfoundland : He had no remedy in the exigence, 
bat to go with the (hip; and had a pretty good voyage 
as far as the Banks, io they call the place where they 
catch the fifh, where mdeting with a French ihip bound 
from France to Quebec, in theri ver of Canada, and from 

X thence to Martinico, to carry provifions, he thought he 
ihould have an opportunity to complete his firft defign : 
But when he came to Quebec, the mailer of the ihip died, 
and the ihip proceeded no farther : So the next voyage 
he ihipped himfelf for France, in the ihip that was burnt, 
when we took them up at fea, and then ihipped them 
vnth us for the £aft Indies, as 1 have already faid. 
Thus he had been difappointed in 4ve voyages, all, as 
I may call it, in one voyage, befides what 1 ihall have 
occafion to mention farther of the fame perfon. 

But 1 ihall not make digreilions into other mens 
itories, which have no relation to my own. I return 
to what concerns our affair in the iiland : He came to 
me one morning, for he lodged among us all the while 
we* were upon the iiland ; and it happened to be jufl 
when I was going to viiit the Engliihinen's colony, at 
the fartheft part, of the iiland ; I iay, he came to me, ^ 
and told me, with a very grave countenance, that he

that thirty- fix of them, though not concerned in the 
crime, where the objects of divine vengeance, and. 
bore the weight of that puniftsnent,. • 

I was ienfibly touched wich this difcourfe, and told 
him, his inference was ibjuft, and the whole defiga 
feemed fo fincere, and was really .fo religious in its^wn

he had faid, of. marrying them by a written contra^,

with the men upon the point now, wh«n I came to tl^^m. 
And I knew no reafon why they? fhould i'cruple to let

be granted to be as authentic and valid in England,, as 
if they were married by one of our own . clergymen.-*- 
What was 'afterwards done in this matter, I (hall ipe&

I was very mndi his debtor for the firil; and thanked

there was a God, or a worfhip^ or in what manner God

be fetched off the ifland again? Nay, is it not infinitely 
of more worth to fave io many fouls, than my life is, 
or the life of twenty more of the fame profcflion ? Yes, 
Sir, fays he, I would give Chrift andthe blefled Virgin 
thanka aU my days, if I could be made the leaft happy 
inftruraent of faving the fouls ofthefe poor men, though 
I was never to fet my foot off this iiland, or fee my na-

fays he, with putting me into this work (for which . I 
will pray for yoa all the days of py life) I have one 
humble petition to you, fays he* befides. What is thatr

Friday with me, to be my imerpretfr to them, aad io

I was feniibly troubled at hi& f equefting Friday .becaufe 
I could not think of parting with him, and that lor maoy 
leafons ; he had been the companion of my tra vela.; 
he was not only faithful to me, but fmcercly affectionate 
to the lafl degree ; and I had refolved to do ibmething * 
coniiderable for him, if he outlived me, a» it was prc^- 
babie he would : then I knew, that as 1 had bred F/iday 
up CO be a proteftant, it would quire confound him, to 
bring him to embrace another profeflion ; and he would 
never, while his eyes, were open, believe that his old 
mailer was an heretic, and would he damned ; and. this 
might in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and 
fo turn him back again to his original idolatry. 

However, a fudden thought relieved me in this 
flrait, and it was this; I told him, I could not fay, 
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account 
whatever; thongh a work, tWt xo \itQL v*^&^^^^^

on the other hand, t was periuaded that Friday would 
by no means con feat to part with me ; and then ta 
force him to it, without his confent, would be a mahi- 
fcft injuftice ; becaufe I had promifed I would never 
put him away ; and he had promifed and engaged 

.to me, that he would never leave me, unlefs I put him 

He feemed very much concerned at it ; for he had no 
rational accefs to chefe poor people, feeing he did not 
unUeritand one word of their language, nor they one 
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told hirii 
Friday's fatherhad learned Spaniih, which I fouitd he 
alfo underfiood ; and he fhould ferve him tor ai|^inter«

could perfuade him but he would ftay to endeavour to 
convert them ; but Providence gave another and Yerf 
happy torn to all this. 
- I come back now to the firft part of his objedions* 
^ When we came to the Englilhmen, I fent for them alt 
together ; and after ibme acooonts given them of what 
I had done for them* viz* what neceflary things I had 
provided for them, and how they wer^ diflri bated i 
which they were fenfible of, and rery thankful for ; I 
began to talk to them of the fcandalous life they led, 
and gave them a full account of the notice the clergy* 
aian had already taken of it; and arguing how an- 
ebriftian and irreligioos a life it was, 1 firH aiked them 
if they were married men or batchelors ? They foon ex- 
plained their condition to me, and (hewed me thkt two 
of them were widov^ers, and the other three were Angle 
men or batchelors, I afitedthem, with^what conTcience 
they could take thefe women, and tie with them, as 
they had done, call them their wives, and nave fo many 
children by them, and not to be lawfully married to 
them i 

They all gave me the anfwer that I expedled % vw, 

that there was nobody to mairy them ; that they 

Agreed before the governor to keep them as th^ir wives ; ; 

Bnd to keep rhem> and own them, as their wives ; and t 

they thought^ sls thing» ilQo4 >NuW ih^oi) they ^ere asj

legally married as if they had been married by a par/on, 
xad with all the formalities in the world. 

I t9l4 them, that no doabt they were married in 
the fight «of God, and were bound in confcience to 
keep them as their wives ^ but that thr Jaws of men 
being otherw^e, they mi^ht pretend they were not mar- 
ried, and (b defert the poor women and children here- 
after ; and t)iac their wives being poor de(blate wo. 
men, friendlefs and moneylefs, w^ld have no way to 
help themfelves^ 1 therefore told them, that untefs I 
was adored of their honeft intent, I could do nothing 
for them ; bnt wosld take care, that what I did (hould 
be for th^ women and children, without them ; and 
that unlefs they wodd give Tome aiTurances that they 
would marry the women, 1 could not think it was con* 
venientthey ftiould coatinve together as man and wife ; 
for that it was both icandalous to men and offenfive to 
God» who they could notthink would blefs them, it they 
went on thus 

All this paiTed as I expe6^ed ; and they told me, 
cfpecially Will Atkins, who feemed now to fpeak for the 
reft, that they loved their wives as well as if they had 
been born in thei« own native country, and would not 
leave them upon any account whatever i and they did 
verily believe their wives were as virtuous and as modeft^ 
and did, to the utmoft of their (kill, as much for them, 
and for their children, as any women could poffibly do ; 
and they would not part with them on any account :— • 
And Will.' Atkins, for his own particular, added, if any 
man would uke him away, and offer to carry him home 
to England, and to make him captain of the beft man of 
war in the navy, he would not go with him, if he might 
not carry his wifie and children with him ; and if there 
was a clergyman in the Ihip, he would be married to 
her nowy with all his heart. 

This was juft as I would have it ; the prieft was 
not with me at that moment^ b«t was not far off : 
So, to try him farther, i told him 1 had a clergyman 
widi me, and if he was itncere, I would have him 
married the next morning, and bade him confider of

believed they would be all willing aifo.. I then told 
him, that my friend, the miniiler, was a Frenchman, 
, and could not fpeak Engliih i but that I would aft the; 
clerk between them. He never lb much as alked me 
whether he was a papifl or a proteilant, ^hich was in- 
deed what I was afraid of; but 1 fay they never en- 
quired about it. — So we parted. I went back to my 
clergyman, and Will. Atkins went in to talk with his 
companions. I defired the French gentleman not to 
fay any thing to them till the bufincfs was thoroughly 
ripe ; and I told him what anfwer the men had given 
me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to 
me, and told me, they had been confidering what I had 
fald ; that they were very glad to hear I had a clergy- 
man iu: my company ; and they were very willing to 
give me the fatisfadlion I defired, and to be formally 
married as foon as I pleafed ; for they were far from 
defiring to part from, their wives; and that they meiant 
^ nothing but what was very honeil, when they chofe 
them ; fo I appointed them to meet me the next morn- 
ing ; and that in the mean time they fhould let their 
wives know the meaning of the marriage-law, and that 
it was not paly to prevent any fcandal, but alfo to 
oblige them, that they fhould .not forfake them^ what- 
ever might happen. . , 

The women were eaiily made fenfible of the mean- 
ing of the thing, and were very well fatisfied with it, 
as, inieed, they had reaibn to be ; fo they failed not 
to attend all together, at my apartment, the next morn- 
ing, where I brought out my clergyman , and though 
he had. not on a minifter's gown after the manner 
of England, or the habit of a prieft, after the manner 
of France ; yet having a black veil, fomething like a 
cafTock, with a faih round it, he cHd not look very un- 
like a minifter ; and as for hi& language, I was his in- 
terpreter. • 

But the ferioufnfcfs of his behaviour to them, and 

the fcfuples he made of marrying the women, becaufe 

th^y were not baptized, and p;-bfefled Chriilians, gave 

them aa eajceeding revere ace, for his pcrlbnj and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 119 

there was no need after that to enquire whether he was 
a clergyman or no. 

Indeed I was afraid his fcruple would have been car- 
ried (o far, as that he would not have married them at 
all ; nay, notwithftanding all I was able fay to him, 
he refilled me, though moueftiv, yet very fteadily ; and 
at laft refufed ablolutely to marry them, unlefs he had 
Brft talked with the men, and the women too : and 
though at firfl I was a little backward to it, yet at lait I 
agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the fincerity of 
his defign. 

When he came to them, he let them know, that I had 
acquainted him with their circumilances, and with the 
prefent defign ; that he was very willing to perform 
that part of his fundlion, and marry them, as I had 
defired ; but that before he could do it he mull take the 
liberty to talk with fhem. He told them, that in the 
fight of all different men, and in the fenfe of the laws 
of fociety, they had lived all this while in an open adul- 
tery ; and that it was true, that nothing but the con- 
fenting to marry, or efteftually feparating them from 
one another now could put an end to it ; but theie was 
a dilRculty in it too, "with refped to the laws of Chriftian 
matrimony, which he was not fully fatisfied about, viz. 
that of marrying one that is a profefled Chriftian, to a 
favage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not bap- 
tized ; and yet that he did not fee^ that there was time 
left for it, to endeavour to perfuade the women to be 
baptized, or to profefs the nameof Chrift, whom they 
had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which 
they could not be baptized. 

He told me, he doubted they were but indifferent 
Chriftians themfelves ; that they had but little know- 
ledge of jGod, or his ways, and therefore he could not 
exped that they had faid much to their wives on that 
head yet ; but that unlefs they would promife him to 
tfe th^ir endeavours wichtheir wives, to perfuade them 
to becoine Chriftians, and would, as well as they could, 
inftrudl them in the knowledge and belief of God that 
-made them, and to worlhip Jefus Chrift that redeemed 
them, he could not marry them ; for he would have

it confident with the principles of the Chriftian re-

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered 
it very faithfuUy to them from his mouth, as near his 
own words as 1 could, only fometimei adding fomef> 
thing of my own, to convince them how juft it was, 
and how I was of his mind ; and 1 always very faith- 
fully diftinguiihed between what I faid frqm myfelf, 
and what were the clergyman's words. TChey told 
me, it was very true what the gentleman had faid, 
that they were but very indifferent Chriflians them- 
felves, and that they had never talked to their wives 
about religion. Lord, Sir, fays Will, Atkins, how fliould 
we teach them rengion t Why, we know nothing our- 
felves ; and beiides. Sir, faid he, (hould we go to talk 
to them of God and Jefus Chrift, and heaven i^nd hell, 
'twould but make them laugh at us, andafk us what 
we believe ourfelves ? And if we fliould tell them, we 
believe all the things that we fpeak of to thero> fuch 
as of good people going to heaven, and wicked people 
to the devil, they womd afk us, wh^re we intended to 
go ourfelves, who believe all this, and yet arc fuch 
wickea fellows, as indeed we are? Why, Sir, faid Will, 
'tis enough to give them a furfeit of religion at firll 
hearing. Folxs mull have Ibme religion themfelves 
before they pretend to teach other people. —- Will. 
Atkins, faid X to him,stliough I am afraid what you fay 
lias too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your 
wife, that Ihe is in the wrong ? That there is a God, 
and a religion, better than her own ; that her gods are 
idols, that they can nt ither hear nor fpeak ; that there 
is a great Being that made all things, and that can de* 
ilroy all that he has m^de ; that he rewards the good, 
and punilhes the bad ; that we are to be judged by him 
at lail, for all we do here : you are not fo ignorant, but 
even nature itfelf will teach you, that all this is true ; 
and 1 am faiisiied you knovy it all to be true, and believe 
it yourfelf. 

That's true. Sir, faid Atkins ; but with what face 
can I fay any thing to my wife of all this, when fhe wi41 
tell me immediately, it cannot be true ! 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. m 

Not true, faid I, what do you mean by that ? Why 
Sir, faid he, fhe will tell me it cannot be true, that this 
God (I (hall tell her of) can bejufl, or can puniih, or 
reward, fince I am not punifhed, and fent to the devil» 
that have been fuch a wicked creature as fhe knows I 
have been, even to her, and to every body elfe , and 
that I (hould be fuiFered to live, that have been always 
a^ing fo contrary to what I mud tell her is good, and to 
What I ought to have done. 

Why truly, Atkins, faid I, I am afraid thou fpcakefl 
too much truth ; and with that I let the clergyman know 
what Aikins had faid ; for he was impatient to know :— 
O ! faid the prieft, tell him there is one thing will 
^make him the beft minifter in the world to his wi^, and 
that is repentance ; for none teach repentance like true 
penitents ; he wants nothing, but to repent, and then 
he will be fo much the better qualified to inftrudl Kis 
^fe ; he will then be able to tell her, that there is 
not only a God, and that he is the juft rewarder of good 
and evil ; but that he is a merciful being, and, with in- 
finite' goodnefs and long-fuffering, ' forbears to punilh 
thofe that offend ; waiting to be gracious, and willing 
not the death of a flnner, but rather that he fhould re- 
turn and live ; that he often fufFers wicked men to go 
on a long time, and even refer ves damnation to the gene- 
ral day of retribution ; that it is a clear evidence of God, 
and of a future ftate, that righteous men receive not 
their reward or wicked men their punifhment, till they 
come into another world ; and this will lead him to teacii 
his wife the dodlrine of the refurreftion, and of the lafl 
judgment ; let him but repent for himfelf, he will l>e aft 
excellent preacher of repentance to his wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very ferious 
all the while, and who, we could eafily perceive, was 
more than ordinarily afFefted with it ; when being eager, 
and hardly fufFering me to make an end ; I knew all 
this, inafter, fays he, and a great deal more ; buj I han't

tears flood in his eyes) 'tis paH all that with me. Paft 
it ! Atkins, faid I, What doll thou mean by that ? I 
know well enough what I mean. Sir, fays he ; I mean 
'tis too late ; and that is too true, 

I told itiy clergyman, w ord for word, what he faid ; 
the poor zealous prieft (I muft call him fo ; for be his 
opin bn ^vhat it will, he had certainly a ti\oQ. fingoiar 
afFedion for the good of other mens fouls ; and it would 
be haj'd to think he had not the like for his own ; 1 fay, 
this zealous affedionate man) coukj not refrain tears 
alfo ; but, recovering himfelf, he faid to me, Alk him 
but one queflion. Is he eafy, that it is too late, or is he 
troubled, and wifhes it were not fo ? I put tlie quellion 
fairly to Atkins ; and he anfwered with a great deal ot 
pa0ion. How could any man be eafy in a condition that 
certainly muft end in eternal dellrudion ? That lie was 
far from being eafy ; but that, on the contrary, he be^- 
lieved it would one time or other ruin him. 

What do you mean l^ythat? faid I. Why, he faid, 
he believed he fhould, one time or other, cut his own 
throat to put an end to the terror of it. 

The clergyman fhook his head, with great concern 
in his face, when I told him all this ; but, turning quick 
to me upon it, faid, if that be his cafe, you may affure 
him it is not too late ; Chrift will give him repentance , 
but prayj^fayshe, explain this to him. That as no man 
is faved out by Chrill, and the njerit of his paffion, pro- 
curing divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for 
^y man to. receive mercy ? Does he think he is able 
to fin beycJnd the power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray 
tell him. There may be a time when provoked mercy 
will no longer drive, and when God 'may refufe to hear , | 
but that 'tis never too late for men to aik mercy ; alid \ 
We that are Chrift -s fervants are commanded to preach ^ 
Aiercy at all times, iii the name of Jefus Chrift, to all 
thofe that fincerely repent; fo that 'tis never too late to 
>epent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
l^jhnellnefs ; but>it feemed a$ if he turned off the diC- 
^oiirfe to the reft ; for he faid to me, he would , go ani 
Ai^c tome talk with ^ 'wfe •, fe V^ wtk twx ^wrhile J

And wc walked to the reft«. I perceived they wete all^^u* 
pidi/ ignorant^ as t« matters of Teligion ; much as I was 
when I went rambling away from my father ; and yet 
that th^re were none of them backward to hear what; 
had been faid, and all of them ferioufly promifed, tha«^' 
they would talk with their wives about it, and to do their 
endeavour to perfuade them to turn chriftians. 

The clergyman fmiled upon me, when I reported what 
anfwer they gave, but faid nothing a good while ; but, 
at lai^, fhaking his head. We that are Chriil's fervants, 
fays he, can go no further than to exhort and inftrudl J 
and when men comply, fubmit to the reproof, and pr#» 
mife what we afk, 'tis all we can do ; we are bound to 
accept their good words ; but, believe me, Sir, faid he, 
whatever you may have known of the life of that man 
you call William Atkins, I believe he is the only iincere 
convert among them ; I take that man to be a true peni- 
tent ; I won't deQ)air of the reft ; but that man is per- 
fectly ftruck with the fenfe of his paft life ; and I doubt 
not, but when he comes to talk of religion to his wife, 
he will talk himfelf eiFedually into it ; for attempting tq 
teach others is fometimes the beft way of teaching our- 
felves. I knew a man, added he, who, having nothing 
but a fummary notion of religion himfelf, and being 
wicked and profligate, to the Taft degree, in hi^ life, 
made a thorough reformation , in himfelf, and being 
to convert a Jew ; and if that poor Atkins begins but 
once to talk ferioufly of Jefus Chrift to his wife, my life 
for it, he talks himfelf into a thorough convert, makes 
himfelf a penitent j and who knows what may follow ? 

Up®n tkis difcourie howevtr, and their promifing, as 
above, to endeavour to perfuade their wives to embrace 
chriftianity, he married the other three couple ; but 
Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come m; after 
this my clergyman, waiting a while, was curious to

We obferved him very earneH with her, pointing up to

made him, and her, and the heavens, the earth, the

immediately we perceived Will Atkins flart upon his 
feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his 
hands : we fuppofe he faid fomething, but we could not

kneeling half a minute, but comes and fits down again 
by his wife, and talks to her again. We perceived then 
the woman very attentive, but whether fhe faid any 
thing or no, we could not tell. While the poor fellow 
was upon his knees, I could fee the tears run plentifully 
down my clergyman's cheeks : and I could hardly forbear,

were not near enough* to hear any' thing that paiTed be-

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear 
of diilurbing them : lb we refolved to fee an end of 
this peace of Hill converfation ; and it fpokeloud enough

To this he anfvvered with abundance of candour, and 
chriftidn charity, thus : Sir, I am a catholic of the 
Roman church, and a prieft of the order of St. Bene- 
di^, and I embrace ail the principles of the Roman 
faith : but yet, if you will believe me, and this I do not 
fpeak in compliment to you, or in refpeft to my circum-^ 
ftances, and your civilities: I fay, neverthelefs, I do 
not look upon you, who call yourfelves reformed, with- 
out fome charity : I dare not fay, though I know it-is 
our opinion in general : yet, I dare not fay, that you 
cannot be faved, \viU by no means limit the mercy of 
Chrill, fo far as to think that he cannot feceive you into, 
the bofom of his church, in a inatmer, to us, imper- 
ceivable, and which it is impoffible for us to know : 
and I hope you have t le fime charity for us ; I pray 
daily for your being all reftored to Chrift's church, by 
wharfoover methods he, who is all wife, is pleaied to 
dire(!l. Jn the mean time, fure, you will allow it to 
confiil with me, as a Roman, to diftinguiOi far between 
a proteftant and a pagan : between one that calls on

citifrch, we hoj^ you are nearer being reftored t6'it, thaa 
thofethat know nothing at all of God, or his churqk : 
I rejoice therefore, when I fee this poor man, who, ffkL 
fay, has been a profligate, and almoft a murderer, kneel 
down and pray to Jefus Chrill, as we fuppofe he did, 
though not fully enlightened ; believing that God, from 
whom every fuch work proceeds, will tenfibly touch his 
heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of the 
truth in his own time , and if God fhall influence this 
poor man to convert and inftrudl the ignorant favage his 
wife, I can ntver believe that he fhall be call away him- 
felf :^ and have I not rerJon then to rejoice, the nearer 
any are brought to the knowledge of Chrill, though they 
may not be brought quite home into the bofom of the 
, catholic church, jail at the time when I may deflre it ; 
leaving it to the goodnefs of Chrill to perfeft his work 
Uk his own time, and his own way I Certainly | would 
rejoice, if all the fa vages in America were brought, like 
this poor woman, to pray to God, though they were to 
be all proteftants at firft, rather than they Ihould continue 
pagans and heathens ; firmly believing that he who had . 
bellowed that firfl light upon them, would farther illu- 
minate them with abeam of his heavenly grace, and 
bring them into the pale of his church when he fhould 
fee good. 

I was aflonifhed at the fmcerity and temper of this 
truly pious papift, as much as I was opprefTed by the 
power of his reafoning ; and it prefently occurred to my 
thoughts, that if lucha temper was univerfal, we might 
b« all catholic chrillians whatever church, or particular 
profeflion we joined to, or joined in; that a fpiritof 
charity would foon work us ail up into) right principles > 
and, in a word, as he thought that the like charity would 
make us all catholics, fo 1 told him, I believed, had all 
the members of his church the like moderation they 
would foon be all proteftants : and there we left that 
part, for we never difputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way, and, takinrg 
iiim by the hand, my friend, faid I, I wi(h all the

^t may be fo, faid he, I know not what tliey might do 
in Spain or Italy ; but I will not fay they would be the 
better chriftians for that feverity ; for I am fure there is 
no herefy in too much charity. 

Weil, as Will Atkins and his wife vere gone, our 
, bufinefs there was over ; fo we went back our own 
way ; and when we came back, we found them waiting 
to be called in. Obferving this, I afked my clergyman 
if we Ihould difcover to him that we had feen him un- 
der the bufli, or no ; and it was his opinion we {hduld 
not ; but that we fhould talk to him firft, and hear wjiat 
he would fay to us ; fo we called him in alone, no- 
body being in the place but ourfelvesj and I begun with 
him thus : 

* Will Atkins, faid I, prithee what education had you ? 
What was your father ? 

W. A. A better man than ever I fhall be. Sir, my 
^ father was a clergyman. 

R. C. What education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would have taught me well. Sir ; but I de- 
fpifed all Education, inftrudtion, or corrcftion, like a 
beaft as I was. 

R. C. Itistrue, Solomon fay?. He that defpifeth re- 
proof is brutifh. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutifh indeed ; I murdered 
my father ; for God's fake. Sir, talk no more about 
that. Sir ; I murdered my poor father. 

Prieft. Ha: I a murderer I* 

* Here the prieft ftarted (for I interpreted every 
word as he fpoke it) and looked pale ; It feems 
he believed that Will had really killed his own 
father. 

R. C. No, no. Sir, I do not underftand him fo ; Will 
Atkins explain yourfelf; you did not kill your father, 
did yoi|, with your own hands ? 

W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat ; but I cut 

lAe thread of all liis comforts, and (hortetved his days ; 

/broke his heart by the moft ungraicfvd wnxvaxxtt^ t^-

turn for the moil tender afFeSionate treatment that ever 
father gave, or child could receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not afk you about your father, to 
extort this confeffioi*; I pray God give you repentance 
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other fins ; 
but I aiked you, becaufe I fee that though you have not 
much learning, yet you are not fo ignorant as fome ar?, 
in things that are good ; that you have known more of 
religion a great deal thaa you have pra£Ufed. 

W. A. .Though you. Sir, did not extort the confefucn 
hat I make about my father, confcience does ; and 
whenever we come to look back upon our lives, th2 
fins againft our indulgent parents are certainly the firfl 
that touch us ; the wounds they make lie deepcft ; ar.d 
the weight they leave will lie heaviell upon the mind tf ' 
all the iins we can commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and fenfible for me At-. 
kins ; I cannot bear it. ^ 

W. A. You bear it, mailer ; I dare fay you knew 
nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins, every fhore, every hill, nay, I 
may fay, every tree in this ifland is witncfs to the an- 
guiftiofmy foul, for my ingratitude, and bafe ufage of 
a good tender father; a father much like yOur's, by 
your defcription , and I murdered my father as well as 
you. Will Atkins ; but think, for all that, my repen- 
tance is ihort of your's too* by a great deal. 

* I would have faid more, if I could have retrained 
my paflions ; but I thought this poor man's repen- 
tance was fo much fincerer than mine, that I was 
going to leave off the difcourfe, and retire ; for I 
was furprifed with what he faid, and thcught tlip.t 
inftead of my going about to teach and inlirud 
him, the man was made a teacher and inftru^^or to 
me, in a molt furpriling and unexpefted, manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was 
greatly afFefted with it, and faid' to me. Did I not fay. 
Sir, tiiat when this man was converted, he would preach 
to us all 1 I tell you. Sir, if this one man be made a 
true penitent, here will be no need of me ; he will make

pofed myfelf, I renewed my difcourfe with Will Atkins. 

But, Will, faid I, How comes the fenfe of this matter 
to touch you juft now ? 

W. A. Sir, you have fet me about a work that has 
flruck a dart through my very foul ; I have been talking 
about God and religion to my wife, in order, ^ you 
directed me, to make a chriilian of her ; and fhe h^s 
preached fuch a fermon to me as I fhall never forget 
while I live. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to 
you, but when you wei'e moving religious arguments 
' to her, confcience has flung them back upon you. 

W. A. Ay> Sir, with fuch a force as it is not to 'be 
refilled. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what pafTed between 
you and your wife, for I know fomething of it al- 
ready. 

W. A. Sir, itis impoffible to give ycua full account 
©f it, I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongiie 
to exprefs it, but let her have faid what Ihe will, and ' 
though I cannot give you an account of it, this I can 
tell you of it that I refolve to amend arid reform my 
life: 

R. C. But tell us fome of it. How did you begin. 
Will ? For this has been an extraordinary cafe that is 
certain, Ihe has preached a fermon, indeed, if fhe has 
wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I firfl told her the nature of our laws 
about marriage, and what the reafons were that men 
and women were obliged to enter into fuch compaft , 
as it was neither in the power of one or other to break, 
that otherwife order and. jufticc could not be maintaired, 
and men would run from their wives, and abandon their 
childrep, mix confufedly with one another, and neither 
families, be kept entire, or inheritances be fettled by a 
legal defcent. ' . 

R. C. You talk like a civilian. Will. Could yo unmake 
her underftand what you meant by inheritance and fami- 
lies ? They know no fuch thing among the favages; but 
marry any how, without any regard to relation, con-

kave been told, even the father and daughter, and the 
fon and the mother. 

W. A. I believe. Sir, you are mifmformed, and my 
wife aflures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it, 
perhaps, for any further relations, the may not be fb 
exaft as we are ; but ihe tells me they never touch one 
another in the near relation you fpeak of. 
R. C. Well, whiat did ihe fay to what you told her ^ 
W. A^ She faid fhe liked it very well, and it was 
much better than in her country. 
R. C- But did you tell her what marriage was ? 
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I aiked 
her, if (he would be married to me our way ? She 
aiked me. What way that was ? I told her marriage 
was appointed of God ; and here we had a llranee talk 
* together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe. 
N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his 
wife, as I took it down in writing, juil after he told 
it me, was as follows : 
Wife. Appointed by your God ! Why, have you a God 
in your country ? 
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 
Wife. No your God in my country ; my country have 
the great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to ihew you who G6d 
is; God is in heaven, and make the heaven andtlje 
earth, thefea, and all that in them is. 

Wife. No makee de earth ; no you God makee de 
earth ; ho make my country*. 

• W. A. laughed a little at her expreflion of God not 
making her country. 

Wife. .No laugh : Why laugh me ? This no ting to 
laeghf. 

f He was jiiftly reproved by his wife ; for flie was 
more ferious than he at RrR. 

W. A. That's true indeed , I will not laugh any more, 
my dear.

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true indeed ; but I have been a wicked 
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee 
with any thing before, but have lived without God in 
the world myfclf. 

Wife. What have you de great God in you de country, 
you no, know him ? No fay O to him ? No good ting 
for him ? That no impofRble ! 

W. A. It is too true though for all that : we live as 
if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no power 
on earth. 

Wife. But why God let you do (b ? Why he no makee 
yeu good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault ? 

Wife. But you fay me, he is great, much great, have 
much great power ; can make kill when he will ; why 
he no makee kill when you no ferve him ? No fay O to 
him? No be good mans ? 

W. A. That is true ; he might ftrike me dead, and I 
ought to expe^ it ; for I have been a wicked wretch, 
that is true ; but God is merciful, and does not deal with 
us as we defer ve. 

Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for that 
too? 

W. A. No,>indeed : I have not thanked God for his 
mercy, any more than I have feared God for his 
power. 

Wife. Then you God no God ; me no think, believe 
he be iuch one, great much power, ftrong ; no makee 
kill you, though you makee him much angry. 

W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you from 
believing in God ! What a dreadful creature am I ! And 
what a lad truth is it that the horrid lives of chriitians 
hinders the converfion of heathens .

what the reproach of his own carriage would make

W. A. My dear, you mean you wifti I could teach

Here the poor man faid he could forbear no longer^

prayed to God aloud to inftruft her in the knowledge 
of himfelf, b) his fpirit : and that by fome good provi- 
dence, ifpofTible, (he might fome time or other come 
to have a bible, that fhe might read the word of God, 
and be taught by him to know him. 

This was the time that we faw him lift her up by 
the hand, and faw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had feveral other difcourfes, it feems, after 
this, too long to fet down here : *and particularly fhe 
made him promif?, that iince he confeffed his owf. 
life had been a wicked abominable courfe of provoca-

as (he called it, and then4he fhould be left alone, and 
never be taught to know this God better, and left he 
ihould be miferable, as he had told her wicked men 
fhould be after death. 

This was a ftrxmge account, and very affefting to us 
both, but particularly the young clergyman : he was 
indeed wonderfully lurprifed with it : but under the 

J;reateft afRidlion imaginable, that he could not talk to

he could not underftand her. However, he turned 
himfelf to me, and told me, that he believed there-muft 
be more to do with this woman than to marry her : I 
did not underfland him atfiril:, but at length he explain- 
ed himfelf: viz. That fhe ought to be baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for 
going about it prefently : No, no : hold, fir, faid he, 
though I would have her baptifed by all means, yet I 
muft obferve, that Will Atkins, her hufband, has, in- 
deed, brought her ;n a wonderful manner to be willing 
to embrace a religious life : and has given herjufl ideas 
of thfe being of a God, of his power, jultice, and mercy : 
yet 1 defire to know of him, if he has faid any thing 
to her of Jefus Chrift, and of the falvation of fmners : 
of the nature of faith in him, and the redemption by 
him : ©rthe holy fpirit, the refurredlion, the lall judj^-. 
ment, and a future ftate. 

I called Will Atkins again, and alked him : but the 
poor fcllow fell immediately into tears, and told us, 
he had faid fomcthing to her of all thofe things, but 
that he was himfelf fo wicked a creature, and his own 
confcience fo reproached him with his horrid ungcdj/ 
life, that he trembled at the apprehen lions, that her 
knowledge of him fhould leffen the attention Ihe fhould 
give to thofe things, and make her rather contemn reli- 
gion, than receive it :- but he was affured, he faid, that 
her mind was fo difpofed to receive due imprefllons of 
all thofe things, that if I would but difcourfe with her, 
Ihe would make it appear to my fatisfadlion, that my la- 
bour would not be lolt upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myfelf as 
interpreter between my religious prieft and the woman, 
I intreated him to begin with her : but fure fuch a fer- 
mon was never preached by a popifh prieft in thcfe 
latter ages of the wo'rld : and, as I told him, I thought 
he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the iince- 
rity of a Chrillian, without the errors of a Roman Ca- 
tholic : and that I took him to be fuch a clergyman as the 
Roman biftiops were, before the church of Rome afi'um-

T^e match being propofed in this manner, we mar- 
ried them them the fame day, and, as I was father at the 
altar, as I may fay, and gave her away, fo I gave her 
a portion, for I appointed her and her hafband a hand- 
fome large fpace of ground for their plantation, and, 
indeed, this match, and the propofal the yotmg gentle- 
man made to nie, to give him a fmall property in the 
iiland^ put me upon parcelling it out among them, that 
they might not quarrel afterwards about their fituation. 

Thisfharing out the land to them I left to Will At- 
kins, who, indeed, was now grown a moft fober, grave 
managing fellow ; pcrfedUy reformed, exceeding pious 
and religious ; and, as far as I may be allowed to fpeak 
pofitively in fuch a cafe, I verily believe, was a true, 
^cere jwenitent. 

He divided things fojuftly, and fo much to every 
one's fatisfadtion, that they only deiired one general 
writing under my hand for the whole ; which I caufed 
to be drawn up, and iigned and fealed to them, fetting 
out the bounds and fituation of every man's jplanta- 
tion, and teftifying, that I gave them thereby, feveral- 
ly, a right to the whole pofleflion and inheritance of 
the relpedive plantations of farms, with their improve- 
ments, to them and their heirs ; referving all the reft of 
the ifland as my own property, and a certain rent for 
every particular plantation, after eleven years, if I or 
any one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, 
producing an attefted copy of the fame writing. 

As to government and laws among them, I told 
them, I was not capable of giving them better rules 
than they were able to giv« themfelves : only made 
them promife me, to Hve in love and good neighbour- 
hood with one another : And fo I prepared to leave 
them. ^ 

'One thing I muft not omit: and that is, that being 
now fettled in a kind of common wealth among them- 
felves, and Irving much buiinels in hand, it was but 
odd to have feven and thirty Indians live in a nook of 
the ifland, independent, and, indeed, unemployed : for, 
excepting thejjroviding themfelves feed, which they had

with Friday's father and propof^ to them to remove, 
and either jplant for themfelves, or take them ii;kto their 
ibveral ^unilies as fervants, to be maintained for their 
labour, but without beiag abfdute ilaves» for I would 
Hot admit them to m^kke them flaves by force, by any 
means, becaufe they had their liberty given by capitu- 
lation, and, as it were article* of furr«nder, which they 
ought not to break. 

. Tkey moft willingly embraced the proppfal, and came 
all very cheerfully ^ong with him , fo we allotted them 
land, aiad ^antatioas, which three or four accepted of, 
but all the reft chofe to be employed as fervants in the 
ieveral families we had fettled , and thus my Cdony was 
in a manner fettled, as follows : the Spaniards pofiefied 
my original habitation, which was theurapital city, and 
extended their planution all along the fid<: of the broiok, 
which made the creek that I have fo often defcribed, as 
far as Qiy bower, and as they increafed their culture, 
it went always eadward ; the Engliih lived in the north- 
ead part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, 
and came on fouthward, and fouth-wed, towards the 
back part of the Spaniards, and every plantation had a 
^reat addition of land to take in, if they found occaiion, 
fo that they need not jofUe one another ^or want of 
room. 

All the weft end of the ifland was left uninhabited, 
diat if any of the favages fhould come on (hore there, 
only for their ufual cuftomary barbarities, they might 
come and go ; if they difturbed nobody, nobody would 
difturb them : and no doubt but they were often aihore, 
and went away again : for I never heard that the plant- 
ers were ever attacked and difturbed any more. 

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to 
my friend the clergyman, that the work of converting 
the favages might, perhaps, be fet on foot in his ab- 
fence, to his fatisfadion : and I told Ij^m, that now I 
thought it was put in a fair way : for the ikvages being 
. thus divided among the Chriftians, if they would buc 
everyone of them do their part with thoiie which came 
under their bands, I hoped it might have a very good

and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one 
by one, which he thought bell ; fo we divided it ; he 
to fpeak to tlie Spaniards who where all papiih ; and I 
to the Englifli who were all proteftants ; and we recom-

that they would never make any diflinflion of papifl 
or proteilant, in their exhorting the favages to mm 
Chri^ians, but teach them the general knowledge of 
the true God, and of their Saviour Jefus Chriil : and 
they likewife promifcd us, that they would nererhave 
any differences or difputes, one with another^ about 
religion, 4 *

I came thither, I fouiid the young woman I have Men- 
tioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were become 
ixxtimates, and this prudent, religious, young woman, 
jjad perfeded the work Will Atkin's had begun : and 
though it was not above four days after what I ^ave 
related, yet the new -baptized favage woman was made 
fuch a Chriftian, as I have feldom heard of any like 
her, in all my obfervation, or converfation in the 
world. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning, before I 
went to them, that among all the needful things I had 
to leave with them, I had not left a bible : in which I , 
ftewed myfelf lefs confidering for them, than my good 
friend the widow was for me, when ihe fent me the

bibles and a prayer-book. However^ tlie good woman's 
charity had a greater extent than ever me imagined, 
for they were referred for the comfort and inllruclion 
of thofe that made much better ufe of them than I had 
done.

The young woman was vcrv glad of it alfo, for the 
prdent occaiioh, though (he had one: and fo had the 
youth on board our (hip, among the goods, which were 
not yet brought on (hore. And now, having faid fo 
many things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling 
one (lory more of her and myfelf, which has fomething 
in it very informing and remarkable. 

i have related to what extremity the poor young wo- 
man was reduced ; how her miilrefs was flarved to death 
and did die, on board that unhappy (hip w^ met at fea ; 
and how the whole fliip's company being reduced to the 
Jaft extremity, the gentlewoman, and her fon, and this 
maid, were firfl hardly ufed» as to providons ; and, at . 
lafl, totally negleded and (larved , that Is to fay, brought 
to the laft extremity of hunger. 

One day, being difcpurfmg with her upon the extre- 
mities they fuiFered, I afked her, if (he could defcribe, 
by what (he felt, what it was to (larve, and how it ap 
peared ? She told me, (he believed (he could ; and " 
told her tale very dtMndly thus : 

Firft, Sir, faid (he, we had for ibme days fared ex- 
ceeding hard, and (iiffered very great hunger ; but nom^, 
at laft, we were wholly without food of any kind, ex- . 
ceptfugar, and a little wine, and a' little water. The 
firft day after I had received no food at all, I found my- 
felf, towards evening, (irft empty and (icki(h at my fto- 
mach ; and nearer night, mightily inclined to yawning 
and (leefpy ; I .laid down on a couch, in the great cabin^ 
to (leep ; and Hept about three hours, and awaked a 
little refre(hed, having taken a glafs of wine when I lay 
down ; after being about three hours awa!2e, it being 
about five o'clock in the morning, I found myfelf emp- 
ty, and my ftomach (ickifh again, and laid down again ; 
but could not (leep at all, bemg very faint and ill ; and 
thus I continued all the fecond day, with a ftrange va« ' 
riety, firft hungry, then iick again, with reachings to 
vomit ; the fecond night, being obliged to go to bed 
SLgdo.n', without any food more than a draught of fair

I thought my llomach was full after this, as it wouU 
have been after, or at, a good dinner ; but when I wak- 
ed, I was exceedingly funk in my fpirits to find myfelf 
in the extremity of famine : the laft glafs of wine we had,* 
I drank, and put fugar into it, becaufe of its haiHng 

' fome fpirit to fupply nouriflunent ; but there being no 
fubilance in the ftomach for the digefting office to work 
upon, I found the only effedtof die wine was, to raiie 
difagreable fumes from the (iomach into the head ; and I 
lay, as they told me, ftupid and fenfelefs, as onedrunkf 
for fome time.. ^ 

The third day in the morning, aftera night of ftrange 
and confufed inconfiftant dreams, and rather dozing than 
fleeping, I Awaked, ravenous and furious with hunger ; 

. and 1 queflion, had not my underilanding returned, and 
conquered it, I fay, I queflion whether, if I had been a 
mother, and had a little child with me, its life would 
have been fafe, orno. 

This lafted about three hours ; during which time 
I was twice Paging mad, as any creature in Bedlam, as 
my young mailer told me^ and as he can now inform 

In^ne of thefe fits of lunacy, or oiftradion, whether 
by the motion of the (hip, or fome flip of my foot, I 
know not ; I fell down, and flruck my face againft the 
corner of a pallet bed, in which my miitref^ lay ; and . 
with the blow the blood gufhed out of niy.nofe ; and 
the cabin boy bringing me a little bafbn, I (at down, and 
bled iiito it a great deal ; and as the blood ran from me, 
I came to myielf : and the violence of the flame, or the 
fever I was in, abated, and fo did the ravenous part of 
the hunger. 

Then I grew'fick, and reached to vomit, but could 
not ; for I had nothing in my ftomach to bring up ; after 
I had bled fome time, I fwooned, and they all believ* 
ed I was dead ; but I came to myfelf foon after, and 
then had a moil dreadful pain in my flomach, not to be

Something like, US ITuppofe, the longing ^f a woanaa 
mthchila. I took another, draught of water^ with fu- 
gar in it, btit my ftomach loathed the fugar, and brought 
It all up again ; then 1 took a draught of water, with- 
out fugar, and that flayed with me ; and laid me down 
lipon the bed, praying moft heartily, that it would pleafe 
God to take me away ; andcompo^ng my mind in hopes 
of it, I flumbered awhile ; and then waking, thought my 
felf dying, being light with vapours from an empty flo- 
mach, I recommended n;y foul to God, and earnelUy 
wlfhed that fomebody would throw me into the iea. 
' All this while my miftrefs lay by me, juft, as I 
thought expiring ; but bore it with much more patience 
than 1, and g^ave the laft bit of bread ihe had to her 
child* my young mailer^ who would not have taken it« 
but fhe obliged him to eat it; and, I believe> it faved 
his life. 

Towards the mornings I flept again ; and firft, when I 
awaked, I fell into a violent pafllon of crying ; and 
after tha^ had a fecond £t of violent hunger, fo that I 
got up ravenous, and in a moil dreadful condition : had 
xny miftrefs been dead, as much as I loved her, I am 
certain, I (hould have eaten a piece of her flefh with as 
much relifh, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the fleih 
of any creature appomted for food ; and once, or twice, 
I was going to bite my own arm. At lad; I faw the 
bafon, in which was the blood I had bled at my nofe 
tlie day before ; I ran to it, and fwallowed it with fuch 
halle, and fuch a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered 
nobody had taken it before^ and afraid it fhould be 
taken from me now. 

JThough after it was down, the thoughts of it filled 

me with horrpr, ye jt checked the fit of hunger; and 

I drank a draught of fair water, and was compofed and 

refrefhed for Ibme hours after it. This was the fourth 

day, and thus I held it till towards night, when, within 

the compafs of three hours, I had all thefe feveral cir- 

cumilances over again, one after another ; viz. fick, 

Jlcepy, eagerly, hungry, pain iYithe ftomack, then ra- 

^s again, then fick again, then lunatic, then crying, 

•avenous again, and fo every quarter of an hour j 

y Arength wafted exceedingly. At night I laid

tat down, having, no comfort* but in the hope that I 
iSiould die before morning. 

All this night I had no ileep, bat the hanger was now 
turned into difeafe ; and I had a terrible choUc and 
griping ; wind, inilead of food, having found its way 
into the bowek ; and in this condition I l&y till morn- 
ing, when I was furprifed a little with the cries and la- 
mentations of my young mafter, who called out to me, 
that his mother was dead. I lifted myfelf up a little, 
for I had not flrength to rife, but found (he was not 
dead, though (he was able to give very little figns of life. 
I had then fuch convulfions in my ftomach, for want 
of fome fuftenance, that I cannot defcribe them , with 
fuch frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that no- 
thing but the- tortures of de^ can imitate ; and this 
condition I was in, when I heard the feaman above cry 
out, A fail, a fail, and halloo and jump about as if the/ 
were diflradted. - 

I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mif- 
trefs much lefs ; and my mailer was fo fick, that I 
thought he had been expiring ; fb we could not open 
the cabin door, or get any account what it was that cc- 
cafioned fuch a 6ombuftion; nor had we any converfa* 
tioB with the ihip's company for two days, they having 
told us they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in 
the fhip ; and they told us afterwards* they thought we 
iiad been dead. 

It was this dreadful condition we were in* when you 
were fent to fave our lives : and how you £aand us. 
Sir, you know as well as I, and better too. 

This was her own relation, and is fuch a difUn£t ac- 
count of ilarving to death, as I confefs^ I never met 
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : I am th^ 
rather apt to believe it to be a true^account, becaufe the 
youth gave me an account of a good part of it ; though 
I mull own, not fo diftinft, and fo feelingly, as hi> 
maid ; and the* rather, becaufe, it feenis, his mother 
fed him at the price of her own life: but the poor,

too, fbc might ilruggle harder with it : I fay, the poor

fooner tliin her miftrefs^ who might be allov\^edto keep 
the laft bits fomctlung longer than ihe parted with any to 
relieve the maid. No queftion, as the cafe is here relatr 
td, if our fhip, or fome other, had not fo providenti- 
ally met them, a few days more would have ended all 
their lives, unlefs they had prevented it by eating one 
another 5 and even that, as their cafe flood, would have 
ferved them but a little while, they being 500 leagues 
from any land : or any poflibility of relief, other than 
in the miraculous manner it happened ; but this is by 
the way. I return to my difpoiition of things among 
the people. 

And fir^y it is to be obferved here, that, for many 
reafons, I did not tliink fit to let them know any thing 
of the floop I had framed, and which I thought of fetting 
up among them : for t found, at leafl at my firil coming, 
fuch feeds of divifion among them, tha^I faw it f>lainly, 
had I fet up the floop, and left it among them, they 
would, upon very light difgufl, have feparated, and 
gone away from one another ; er perhaps, have turned • 
pirates, and fo made the ifland a den of thieves, inflead 
of a plantation of fober and religious people, as I intend- 
ed it to be ; nor did 1 leave the two pieces of brafs can- 
non that I had on board, ot the two quarter deck guns, 
that my nephew took extraordinary, for the fame rea- 
fon : 1 thought they had enough, to q^nalify them for » 
defcnfive war againft any that fhould invadelhem j but 
Iwas not to fet fhem up for an offenfive war, or to en- 
courage them to go abroad to attack others, which in 
th e end , wo uld only bring ruin and dellr u^ion upon 'themr 
felves and all their undertakings ; I refer ved the floop, 
therefore, an^ the guns, for their fervice another way, 
as I fhall obferve in its place. 

I have now done with the ifland: I left them all in 
good circumflances, and in a flourifhing condition, and 
went on board my fhip again the 5 th day of May, hav- 
ing been five and twenty days amon^ them ; and, as 
they were all refolved to ftay upon, the ifland till I came 
to remove them, I prOYnifed to fend fome further relief 
from the Brafils, if I could poflibly find an opportunity t 
and particularly, I pron^ifed to fend them fome cattle :

been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them 
at fea, for want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a falqte of iive guns at 
parting, we fet fail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, 
in the Braiils, in about 22 days : meeting nothing re- 
markable in our paffage, but this, that about three days 
after we failed, being becalmed, ^nd the current fettlDg 
Rrong tothxN.N. E. running, as it were, into a bay 
or gulph, on the land fide, we vvere driven fomething 
out of our courfe ; and once or twice our men cried, land 
to the weilward : but whether it was the continent or 
lidands, we could not tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the fea (inooth, 
and the weather calm, wphw the fea, as it were, co^ 
vered towards ihe land, with fomething very black> 
not being able to difcover what it was : but, aftei: Sfi^^

it was an army*. I could not imagine what he meimt 
by an army, and fpoke a little liaftily, calling the fel- 
low a fool, or fome fuch word : Nay, Sir, fays he^ 
don't be angry, for it is an army^ and a fleet too : for 
I believe there are a thoufand canoes, and you may fee 
til em pa^ddle along, and they are coming towards us too, 
apace, and full of men. 

I was a little furprifed then, indeed, and fb was my 
nephew the captain: for he had heari fuch terrible fto- 
rics of them in the iiland, and having never been in 
thofe feas before, that he could not t^l what to think of

this I did^^at the men in the boats might be ready » 
with fheet and buckets, to put out any fire thele fa* 
vages might endeavour to fbc upon the out/ide of the 
ihip. 

In this poflure we lay by for them, and in a little 
while they came up with us, but never was fuch a hor- 
rid fight feen by Chriftians : my mate was much mif- 
taken in his calculation of their number, I mean of a 
thoufand canoes ; the moft we could make of them 
Ivhen they came up, being about 1 26 ; and a great many 
of them too ; for fome of them had 16 or 17 men in 
Ihem, fome more, and the Icaft fix or fcven. 

When they came nearer to us, they feemed to be 
ftruck with wonder arndaftonifhment, as at a fight which 
they had, doubtlefs, ncvter feen before ; nor could they, 
at iir/l, as we afterwards underflood, know what to make 
of us. They came boldly up however, very near to us, 
and feemed to go about to row round us : but \ve called to 
our inen in- the boats, not to let them come too near them. 
. This very order brought us to an engagement with 
them, without our defighingit : for five or fix of their 
large canoes came fo near our long-boat, that ^ur men 
beckoned with their hands to them to keep back; 
which they underftood very well, arid went back i bixt 
a^ their retreat about 500 arrows came on board us 
from thofe boats ; and one of our men in the long boat 
was very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any means ; 
but we handed down fome deal boards into the boat, 
and the carpenter prefently fet i^) a kind of a fence^, 
like wafle boards,, to cover them 'from the arrows of the 
fava^es, if they fhould fhoot again. - 

Aoout half an hour afterwards they came all up in a 
body aflem of us, and pretty near, fo near that we could 
eafily difcem what they were, though we could not tell 
their defign. I eafily found they were fome of my old 
friends, the fame fort of favages that t had beea ufed 
to engage with ; and in a little time more they rowed 
fomewhat farther out to fea, till they came diredUy

tfpOn this I ordered all my men to keep clofe, left thcjr 
. fiiould fhoot any more arrows, and make all our guns 
read^ ; hut, being fo near as to be within hearing, I 
made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out aloiid 
to them in his language, to know what they meant ; 
which accordingly he did : whether they underftood 
' him or not,^ that I knew not ; but, as foon as he had 
called to them, fix. of them, who were in the fbremoft, 
or nigheft boat to us, turned their canoes from us ; and, 
looping down, (hewed us their naked backfides ; jufl 
as »f, in.Engliih» (faving your prefence) they h»d bid us 
kifs — — ; whether this was a defiance or challenge, 
y/e know not ; or whether it was done in mere con* 
tempt> or.a fignal to the reft ; but immediately Friday 
cried out. They were going to ftioot ; and unhappily 
for him (poor fellow) they let fly about 300 of their ar- 
rows; and to my inexprcffible grief, lolled poor Fri- 
oay , no other man being in their fight. The poor fel- 
low was ihot with no lefs than three arrows, and. about 
three more fell very nigh him ; fuch unlucky markfincn 
they were. ^ 

I was fo enraged with 'the lofs of my old fervant, the ^ 
companion c^ all my forrows and folitudes, that I ' 
immediately ordered iivt guns to be loaded with fmaM 
iho^, and four with great ; and gave them fuch a broad* 
fide as they had never liad in their lives before to be 
ibre. 

They were not above half a cable's length oflT when 
we fired ; and our gunners took their aim lo well tha^ 
three 6r four of their canoes wereoverfet, as we hadrea- 
fbn to believe, by one (hot only. 

The ill manner? of ^turning up th«r bare backfidcs 
to us gave us no great offbnce ; neither did I know iac

I can ndther tell how many we killed^ or how many 
we wounded, at this broadside ; but fure fuch a fright 
and hurry never was feen among fuch a multitude : 
there Were 13 or 14 of their canoes fplit, and overfet>

frighted out of their wits, fcoured away as faft as they 
todd, taking but little care to fave thofe whpfe boats 
were fplit or fpoiled with our ihot : fo I fuppofe that 
Acre were many of them Joil ; and our men took up one 
poor fellow fwimming for his life, above an hour after 
they were all gone. 

Our fmall (hot from our cannon mufl needs kill and 
wound a great many : but,infhort, we never knew any 
thing how it went with them : for they fled fo faft, that, 
in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not fee above 
three or four ftraggling canoes ; nor did we ever fee the 
reft any more: for a breeze of wind fpringbg up the 
fame evening* we weighed and fet fail for the Brafils. 

We hada prifoner mdeed, but the creature was fo 
fuUen, that he would neither eat or fpeak : and we all 
fancied he would ftarve himfelf to death : but I took a 
way to cure him : for I made them take him, and turn 
him into the long boat, and make him believe they would 
tofs him into the fea again, and fo leave him where they 
found hijp, if he would not fpeak : nor would that do, 
but they really did throw him into fea, and came away 
from him: and then he followed them, for he fwam 
like a cork, and called to them in his tongue, tho' they 
knew not one word of what he faid. However, at lall 
they took him in again, and jthen he began to be more 
tradable : nor did I ever defign they fhould drown him. 

We were now undfer fail again : but I was th^ moft

Never 4id a (hip come to this part diat had lefs baii-

we were admitted to hold the leaft correfpondence oat 
ihore : not my partner himfelf, who was alive,: and nude 
a great figure among them ; not my two merchant tra£* 
tees, hor the feme of my wonderful preTenratkm in the 
ifland, could obtain- me that fevour: but my partneiv 
Temembenng that I had given five hundred moMores to 
the prior of the monaftry of the Auguftines , and Uiree 
hundred and feventy-two to the poor> went to the mo^ 
Jiaftry, and obliged the prior ^t^t then was, to go to the 
governor, and beg leave for me pr^ently, with the capi-

ihixre, and no more ; and this upon condition aHblutely 
capitulated fot^ that we ihould i^ot offer to land any 
goods out of the fiiip, or to carry any^perfon away with-

They were fo ftrid with us, as to landing any goods, 
that it was witl» extreme .difficulty that I got on fhore 
three bales of EngHih goods, fuch as fine broad c]oth&»>

my partner afterwards. I got him foon loaded with tha 
fmall cargo I had fent them ; and one of our Teamen » 
that had been on ftiore with me there, offered to go with 
the iloop> and fettle there, upon my letter to the go^ 
vernor Spaniard, to allot him a fufficient quantity of ' 
land for a plantation; and giving him fome clodies^ 
andtobls&r his planting work, which, he faid, he un^^ 
derdood, naving been an old plantei: in Maryland, and a 
buccaneer into thel>argain. y 

I encouraged the fallow by ^ranting aM he deiired ; 
and, asL an addition, 1 gave him the favage ^hich we 
Jiad taken prifoner of war, to be his flave, and ordered 
the governor Spaniard to 'give him his fliarc of every 
thing he wanted witkthc reft. 

When we came to k% this man out, my , oM partner 
told me, there was a certain very honeft fellow, a Bra- 
ii\ planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the 
difpleafure of the church ; I know not what the mzt^ 
ter is with him, fays he ; but, on my conicience, I 
think he is an heretic in his heart ; and he has been 
obliged to conceal hirofelf for fear of the inquifition ; ' 
' thatne would be very glad of fuch an opportunity to 
make his efcape, with his wife and two daughters; 
and if I would letthem go to;the ifland, and allot them 
a plantation, he would give them a fmall ftock ^'be.

allhise^ds and eftate, and he kin* nothing left but a 
' little houfeholll^ Huff, and two flaves ; and, adds hey 
though, I hate his principles, yet I would not have hixn 
M into their hands« for he will affuredly be burnt alive xS- 
he does. 

I granted this presently, and joined my Engli{hn>aii 
iviththem; and we concealed the man, and his wife 
and daughters, on board one fhip, till the fk>op 
put out to go to fea ; and then (having put all their

with them (which was worth all the reft) fome material* 
for planting fugar canes, with fome plants of canes; 
which he, I mean the Portugal man, underftood very

Among the reft of the^fupplies fent my tenants in 
the ifland, I fent them, by this floop, three milch 
cows, and hvt calves, about twenty-two ho^s , among 
them, three fows big with pig, two mares andaftone-^

For my Sjj^amards, according to my promife, I engaged 
three Portugal women to go ; and recommended it to 
them to marry them, and ufe them kindlyr I could have 
procured more women, but I remembered, that the poor 
perfecuted men had two daughters, and there were but 
five of the Spaniards that wanted ; the reft had wives of 
their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived fafe, and, as you may eafily 
fuppofe, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were 
now (with this . addition) between flxty and ieventy 
people, beiides little children ; of which there were a 
great many : I fQund letters at London from them, all 
by way of Liibon, when I Came Back to England, being 
ient back to the Brafils by this iloop , of which I fhall 
take fome notice in its place. 

I have now done with my ifland, and all manner of 
difcourfe about it; and whoever reads the reft of my 
-memorandums, would do well to turn . his thoughts

England, and encreafed it vJith people, as I might eafily 
have done j had 1 then fettled my felf there, and fent the

done in fix months time, and ordered my friends to

plantation : but I never fo much as pretended to plant in 
the name of any govempent or nation, or to acknow- 
ledge any prince, or to call my people fubjedls, toany one 
nation more than another : nay, I never fo much as gave 
the place a name ; but left it as I found it, belonging to 
no man ; and the people under no difcipline or govern- 
ment but my own ; who^ though 1 had an influence over 
them as father and benefactor, had no authority or power 
to ad or command one way or other, . farther than vo- 
luntary confent moved them to comply : yet even this,

as I rambled from them, and came thither no more, the

W6a APVBNTURES OT 

But T was gone a wild goofe chafe indeed ; and tHcf^ . 
who will have any more of me, muft be, content to 
follow me through a new variety of foHies, hard- 
Ihips, and wild adventures; wherein the juftice of 
Providence may be duly obljsrved, and we may fee 
how eafily heaven can gorge us with our own defires, 
make the llrongeft of our wilhes to be our affli6Hon,. 
and punifh us moft fe^^rely with thofe very ^things 
which we think it would be our utmoft happinefs to be 
allowed in* 

Let no wife man flatter himfelf with the ftrength of 
his own judgment, as if he was able to chufe any partr- 
cular flation of life for himfelf. Man is a fhort.iighted 
creature, fees but a very little way before him ; and as 
his pafliohs are none of his beft friends, fo hi/particular 
affedlions are generally his worft counfettors . 

I fay this, with refpedl to the impetuous defire I had 
from a youth, to wander into the wor^d ; and how evi^ 
dent it now was, that this principle was preferved in mc 
for my punifhment. How it came on, the manner, the. 
circumftance, and the conclufion of it, it is eafy to give 
you hiftorically, and with its utmoft variety q£ particu- 
lars. But the fecret ends of Divine Providence, in thus 
permitting us to be hurried down the ftream of our own 
defires, are only to be underftood of thofe who jcan liften 
to the voice of ProvMence, and draw religicus confe- 
quences from God's juftice, &nd their own miftakes. 

Be it, had 1 bufinefs, or no bufinefs, away I went : 
it is no time 4iow to enlarge any farthet* upon .the rea- 
fon or abfurdity of my own conduft : but to come to 
the hiftory, I was embarked for the voyage, and the 
vpyage I went. 

' I ftiall only add here, that my honed and truly pidet 
clergyman left me here : a ihip bein^ ready to go to 
Lifbon, he aflced me leave to go thither ; being ftill, is 
he obferved, bound never to finifti any voyage he be- 
gan ; how hpppy had it been for me, if I had gone wkh 
him. 

But it was too late now : all things heaven appoints 
are beft ; had I gone with him, I had never had fo many 
things to be thankful for, and you had never heard of tiie 
/econd partof the t/aveb and adventures of Robinfon 

Crufoe : 



Cruip^ ; fo I inuft leave here the fruitleis exclaiming at 
siyfelf^ and go on with^ my voyage. 

Prom the Brafils we made^direftly away over the At*- 
lantic fea, to the Cape de Bont^ Efpefrance, or, as we 
call it, the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a tolerable 
good voyage, bor courfe generally fouth-eafl : now and 
then a ftorm, and fome contrary winds. Bat my dif- 
aders at fea were at the end , my future rubs and crofi^ 
events were to befal me oh fliore ;' /that it might appear^ 
the land was as well prepared' to be our fcourage, as the 
lea ; when heaven, who diredls the circumftences of 
things, pleafes to appoint it to be ib. 
- Our (hip was on a trading voyage, and Ifiid a fuper- 
cargo on board, who was to direft all h^r motions, after 
(he arrived at the Cape : only being limited to certain 
number of days, f6r ftay, by charter-party, at the 
feveral ports (he was to go to ; this was none of my bu- 
•finefs, neither did I meddle with it at all ; my nephew 
the captain, and the fupercargo, adjuding allthofe things 
between them as they thought- fit. ' 

We made no (lay at the Cape, longer than was aeed^ 
fat to take in frelh water, but nrade the beft of our way 
for the coall of Coromande ; we were indeed informed^ 
that a French man of war of fifty guns, and two large 
merchant-(hips, were gone for the Indies : ai^d, as i 
knew we were at war with France, I had fome apprehen- 
fions of them ; but they went their own way, and we 
heard «io more of them. , 

I (hall not pefter my account, or the reader, with 
' defcriptions of places^ journals of our voyages, varia*- 
tionsof the compafs, latitudes, meridian didances,trade-^ 
winds, fituation of ports, and the like ; fuch as almoft ah 
(he hiftories of long navigation are full of, and which ^ 
make the reading tirefome enough: and arc perfectly 
«nprofitabie to all that read, except only to thofe who 
are to go to thofe places themfelves. 

It is enoirgh to name the ports and places which we 
touched at ; and what occurred to us upon our pafling^ 
irom one to another. We touched firft at the ifland of 
Madagascar : where,tho* the people are fierce and treach- 
erous, and in particular, very we)l armed ^ith lances and 
hqwh which xheyafe with inconceivftble dexterity « yet

we fared very well with them awhile ; they treated os 
verjt civilly ; and for fome trifles which we gave them, 
fuch as knives^ fciflars^ &c. they brought us i i good fat 
bullocks, middling infize, but very good in flefh ; which 
we took in, partly for frelh proviiions for our prefent 
i^ending, and the red to fait for the ihip's ufci 

We were obliged to ftay here for fome time, after we ^ 
had furnifhed ourfelves with provifions ; and I, that 
was always too curious to look into every nook of the 
world wherever I came, was for going on fhore as often 
«5 1 could. It was on theeaft fide of the ifland that we 
went on fhore one evening ; and the people, who, by 
the way, are very num'eroos, came thronging about 
as, and ^od gazing at us, at a didance : as we had tra- 
ded freely with them, and had been kindly ^ufed, we 
thought ourfelves in no danger ; but when we faw the 
people, we cut three bows out of a tree, and ftuck 
them up. at a diflance from us, which,, it feems, is a 
mark in tlie country, not only of truce and friendfhip, 
but, when it is accepted, the other fide fet up three 
poles, or bows, alfo ; which is a fignal that they accept 
the truce too ; bat then this is a known condition of the 
truce, that you are not to pafs beyond their three poles 
towards them, nor they come pad your three poles 
or boughs toward you ; fo that you are perfefUy.fecure 
within the three poles ; and all the fpace between your 
poles and theirs, is allowed like a market, for free con- 
verfe, traffick, and commerce. ^ When you go thither, 
jou mud' not carry your weapons with you ; and if they 
f ome into that fpace, they dick up their javelins and 
lances, ^1 at the fird poles, and come on unarmed ; but 
if any violence is offered them, and the truce thereby 
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their 
weapons, and then the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on fhore, 
' that a greater number of their people came down 
^an ufual, but was allv?r) friendly and civil. They 
brought with them feveral kinds of provifions, for 
which we fatisfied them with fuch toys as we had ; 
their women alfo brought us milk and roots, and fe- 
vera! things very acceptable to as, and all was quiet ;

and we made us a little tent, or hut« of fbme. boughs of 
trees, and lay on the ihore all that night. 

I know not what was the occafionj^ bat I was not fo 
well fatisfied to lie on (hore as the reft ; and the boat ly- 
ing at an anchor, about a ftone's caft from the land, 
with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of 
them come on fhore ; and getting fome boughs of treea 
to cover as alio in the boat, I fpread the fail oh the bot* 
tom of the boat, and lay on board, under the cover of 
the branches of the trees, all night. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our 
men make a terrible noife on the (hore, calling out, for 
God's fake, to bring the boat in, and come and help 
them, for they were all like to be murdered ; at the fame 
time I heard the firing of five miifquets, which wa^ tht 
number of the guns they had, and that three times over; 
for, itfeems, the natives here were not fo eafily frighted 
with guns as the favages were in America, where I had 
to do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; but 
rou£ng immediately from fleep with the noife, I 
caufed the boat to be thrufl in, and refolved, with 
three fu£ls we had on board, to land, and affift our 
men; 

We got the boat foon to the fhore : but our men 
were in too much hafte : for,, beix^ come to the Ihore, 
they plunged into the water, to gee to the boat with all 
the expedition they could, being purfued by between 
three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in all 
and only five of them had fufils with them :' the reil^ in- 
deedj had piflols and fwords, but they were of (mall ufe 
to them. 

We took op feven of our men, and with, dificulty 
enough too, three of them being «very ill wounded : «nd 
that which was fliil worfe, was, that while we flood in 
the boat to take our' men in, we were in as muck 
danger as they were in on fhore : for they poured their 
Arrows inr uj^n us fo thick, that we were tain to barri- 
cade the fide of the boat up with the benches, and two 
or three loofe boards, which, to our great fatisfa^on, 
we had, by- mere accident^ or providence rather> in the 
boat.

And yet, had it bceit^jr-light, they arc, it teems^ 
futh exad markfmen, tnat if they could have feen but

©ftheip/asthey ftood pelting us from the ihgrc witb 
darts and arrows ; and, having got ready our fire-arms^ 
We gave them a volley ; and we could hear by the cries 
of fome of them, that we had wounded feveral ; how- 
ever, they ftood thus in battle-array on the fhoretilJ 
break of day, which we fuppofe was, that they might 
fee the better ta take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and coold not tell how to 
l^eigh our anchor, or fet up our (ail,- becaufe we muft 
needs ftandr up in the i boat, and they were as fure to hit 
us, as we were to hit a bird in a, tree with fmall Ihot f 
we made fignals of diftrefs to the fhip, which, thpujgli 
fhe rode a Ic^gixe off, yet my nephew the captain,, 
hearing our firing, and, by glafles, perceiving the.p©f- 
ture we lay in, and that we fired towards the ihore, 
pretty well underftood us ; and weighing anchor with 
all {peed, he ftood as near the Ihore as he durft with 
the ihip, and then fent another boat, with ten hands 
in her, to afiift as ; but we called to them not to come 
too near, telling them what condition We were in ; how-^ 
tver, they ftood in nearer to us : and one of the 
men, taking the end of a tow-line in,his^ hand; and 
keeping our boat between him and the enemy, fo that 
tl^ey coukl not perfe^ly fee him, fwam on board us^ 
and made the line faft to the boat ; upon which w«

her, who alfo brought fome roots or herbs ; and while? 
^he old woman, whether (he was mother to. the yo^ng

outcry among the people Ibe came from : who, upon , 
iiotice, raifed this great army upon us in three or fpur

ftroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was

i€r ADVENTURES OP 

We tbok twenty ftout fellows with us as any in the ' 
Ihip, befides the fupercargo and myfelf ; and we landed 
two hours before midnight^ at the fame place where 
the Indians flood drawn up die evening before ; I landed 
here, becaufe my deiign, as I have faid, was chiefly to 
fee if they had (quitted the £eld, and if they had left 
any marks behind them, or of the mifchief we had 
done them ; and I thought, if we could furprife one or 
two of them, perhaps we might get oucman again, by 
way of exchange! 

We landed without any noife, and divided our men 
into two comrpanies, whereof the boatfwain com- 
«ianded one, and 1 the other : We neither could hear 
nor fee any body flir when we landed ; fo we marched 
Mf, one body at a diflance from the other, to the 
fteld of battle : At firft we could fee nothing, it being 
very dark; but by and by, our boatfwain, that led the 
firft party, flumbled ana fell over a dead body : This 
made them halt there awhile , for knowing by the cir- 
cumlUnces, that they were at the place where the In* 
.dians had flood, they waited for my coming up: Here 
weconglnded to halt till the moon began to rife, whieh 
we ' knew would be in lefs than an hour y and then 
we would ^afily difcem the havock we h^d made a-> 
jnong them : We told two and thirty bodies upon the 
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some had 
an arm, and fome a leg, ihot off; and one his head : 
thbfe that were wounded, we fuppofed they had caf^ 
ned away. ^ 

When we had made, as I thought, a full difcovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for 
- going on board again , but the boatfwain and his party 
often fent me word, that they were refolved to make a 
vifit to the Indian town, where thcfe dogs, as they 
called them, dwelt ; and deAred me to go along with 
them ; and if they could find them, as they ftill rancied 
they fliould, they did not doubt, they faid, getting a 

food booty ; and it mi^ht be, they might find Thomas 
effrys there ; that was the man's name we had loft. 
Hdd they fent to aflc my leave, to go, I knew well 
enough what anfwer to have gwtr. \J[vtui\ te \ >NcwLd

twas Hot a Hazard fit for us to run^ who had a ihip^ 
landa fhip's loading in our charge^ and a voyage to 
:makc, which depei^ed very much upon the lives of 
the men; but as they fent me word they were re- 
.folvedtogo, and only afked me and my company to 
:go along with them^ I pofitively refufed it> and rofc 
up (fori was fitting on the ground) in order to go to 
the boat; ©ne or two of the men began to importune' 
me to go ; and when I ftill refufed pofitively, began 
to grumble, and fay they were not under my command, 
andthey would go. ^ Come, Jack, fays one of the men* ^ 
.will you go with me ? I will go for one. Jack faid he 
would; and another followed, and then another ; and, ^ 
iin a word, they all leftmebutone, whom, with much 
difficulty too, I perfuaded to ftay ; fo the Supercargo 
.and 1, with one man, went back to the boat, where, ^ 
I told them, we would ilay for thein> and take care to 
;take in as many of them as (hould be left; fbr I told 
rthem, it was a mad thing they were going about, and 
:fuppored moil of them wou^iim the fate .of Thomas 
Jeffrys. 

They told me, like feamen, the*yd warrant it th^ 
jn^uld come off again ; and they would take care,.&c. 
So away^ they went. I entreated them to confider th6 
fhip, and the voyage; that their lives were not their 
^own ; and that they were intruded with the voyage, 
in fome meafure ; that if they mifcarried, the inip 
might be loft for the want of their help ; and that they 
•could not anfwer it to God and man. I faid a great 
deal more to them on that head, but I xnight as well 
.have talked to the main-maft of the fhip ; they were 
mad 'upon their journey; only they gave me good 
words, and begged! would not be angry ; faid, they 
would be very cautious; and they did not doubt iut 
they would be back again in about an hour at fart^efl ^ 
for the Indian town, they faid; was not above half a 
.mileofF: though they found it above two miles before 
they got to it. 

Well, they M went away, as above ; and though the 
attenxpt was defperate^ and fuch, as none 'but madmea

gaUantly armed^that is true : for they had every -man a 
rufU or mufquet, a bayonet, and every man a pilloU 
ibme of them had broad cutl^ces. Tome of them hangers ; 
and the boatfwain, and two more, had pole-axes^ be-, 
iides air which theyliad among them 13 hand-grena* 
does. Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went 
about any wicked work in the world. 

Whca they went out, their chief defijgn . was plunder , * 
^nd they were in mighty hopes of iincung gold there : 
but a circumilance» which none of them were aware of, 
fet them on fire with revenge, an3 made devils of them 
all* when they came tp ^he few Indian houfes, which 
they thought had been the towiv, which were not above 
half a mile off, they were under a great difappointment : 
^or there were not above twelve or thirteen houfes: and 
where the town was, or how big, they knew not; they: 
confulted therefore what to do, and were fometime be- 
fore they could refolve : for if they fell upon thefe, they 
muil cut all their throats : and it was ten to one but fome 
of them might efcape, it being in the night, thot^h the 
moon was up : and if one efcaped^ he would run a^ay« 
and raife. all the town, (b they fhould have a whole army 
upon them. Again, on the other hand^ if they wetit - 
away, and left thofe untouched (for the jpeojple were 
all afleep) they could not tell which way toiooK for ti^e 
town. 

However., the lail was the beft advice.: fo they re- 
folved to leave thofe houfes, and. look for the town as 
well as they could : they went on a litde way, and 
found a cow tied to. a tree : this they prefently con- 
cluded would be a good guide to them : for they^iaid 
the cow certainly belonged to the town befpreth^m, 
or the town behind^ them : axid if they -untied her^ 
they fliould fee which way ihe went; if ihe went4)ack, 
they had nothing to fay to her 4 but, if Ihe went for- 
ward, they had nothing to do but to follow her: fo 
they cut the cord, which was made of twilled flags, 
and the cow went on before them: in a word, the 
cow led them diredlly to the town^ which, as they 
reported, confifted of above 200 houfes, or huts: and 

lb fome of th^k, they found fev exal families living 

together. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

Sere they found all filent ; as profoundly fecure, as flecp 
id a country that had never feen an enemy of that kind, 
could make them : upon this they called another council, 
to^confider what they had to da; and in a word they re- 
folded to divide themfelves into three bodies, andtofet 
three houfes on fire in three parts of the town : and as 
the men came out, and to fei2e them and bind tliem 
if any refilled, they need not to be aflced what to do then; 
and fo to fearch the reft of the hcufes for plunder ; but 
refolved to march filently firft through the town, and 
fee what dimenfibns it was of, and cbnfider if they might 
venture upon it, or no. 

They did do, and defperately refolved that they would 
venture upon them ; but whik they were animating one 
another to the work, three of them, that were a little 
before the reft, called out aloud, and told them they had 
found Tho. Jeffrys , th^y all ran up to the place, and fo 
ii, was indeed, for there they found the poor fellow hang- 
ed t^ naked by one arm, and his throat cut : there was 
an Indian houfe juft by the tree, where they found fix- 
teen or feventen of the principal Indians, who had been 
concerned in the fray with us before, and two or three 
of them wounded with our (hot ; and our men found 
they were awake, and talking one to another in^at ^ 
houfe, but knew not their number. ^ 

The fight of their poor niangled comrade fo enraged 
them as before, that they fwore to one another, they 
would be revenged, and that not an Indian who came 
into their hands (hould have quarter ; and to work they 
went Immediately ; and yet notfo madly as by the rage 
and fcry they were in might be expefted. Their firft 
care was to get fomething that would foon take fire ; 
but after a little fearch, they found that would be to no 
purpofe, for ipoft of the houfes were low, and thatchei 
with flags or rufhes, of which the country is full ; fo 
they preiently made fome wild fire, as we call it, by wet-* 
ting a little powder in the palms of their hands ; and, in 
a quarter of an hour, they fet the tovvn on fire in four 
•r five places ; and particularly that houfe where the 
Indians were not gone to bed. As foon as the fire be^aa

tempt, and especially at the door, where they drove 
them back, the boatfwain himfelf killing one or two 
with his pole-ax ; the houfe being large, and many in 
it, he did not care to go in, but called for an hand- 
jgrenado, and threw it among them, which, at firft, 
frighted them ; but when . Jt burft, made fuch havock 
among them, that they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In fhort, moft of the Indians who were in the open 
part of the houfe, were killed or hurt with thegrenaido^ 
except two or three more, who preiTed to the door, 
which the boatfwain and two more kept with the bayo- 
nets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dii]^atched all 
who came that way. But there was another apartment 
in the houfe, where the prince or king, or whatfoever 
he was, and feveral others, were ; and they kept in, till 
the houfe, which was by this time all of a light flame, 
fell in upon them, and they were fmothered, or burnt 
together. 

\ All this while they fired not a gun, becaufe they would 
not waken the people fafier than thef could mailer 
them ; but the fire began to waken them faft enough, 
and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in 
bodies ; for the fire grew fo raging, all the houfes be- 
ing ma'de of light combuftible ftufF, that they could 
hamly bear the ftreet between them ; and their bufinefs 
was to follow the fir€ for the furer execution ; as faft as 
the fire either forced the people out of thofe houfes which 
were burning, or frighted them out of others, our peo- 
ple were ready at their doors to knock them on the head, 
flill calling and haUooiMg to one another to remember 
Tho. Jefirys. 

While this v^as doing, I muft confefs I was very un- 
cafy, and efpecially, when I faw the flames of the town, 
which, it being night, feemcd to be juft by me. 

My nephew, the captain, who was roufed by his men

what the matter was, or what danger I was in ; efpeci.- 
ally hearing the guns too : for by this time they began 
%o ufe their fire arms: a thoufand thoughts opprcfled

become of us : and at laft though he could ill fpare any

be Iti, he takes another boat, and with thirteen men 
and himfelf cemes on fhore to me. 

He was furprifed to fee me and the fupercargo in the 
boat, with na more than two men, for one had been 
left to keep the boat ; and though he was glad that we 
were well, yet he was in the fame impatience with us to 
know what was doing; for the noife, continued, and the 
'£ame increafed : I confefs it was next to an impoilibility 
for any men in the world to reftrain their curiofity of 
knowing what had happened, or their concern for the 
fafety of the men. In a word, the captain told me, he 
would go and help his men, let what would come. I 
argfued with him, as I did before with the men, the fafety 
of the Ihipi and the danger of the voyage, the intereft 
of the owners and merchants, &c. and told hint I 
would go, and the two men, and only fee if we could, at 
a diftance learn what was like to be the event, and 
come back and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk 
to the reft before ; he would go, he faid> and he only 
wilhed he had left but ten men in the (hip ; for he could 
not think of having his men loft for want of help : Kc 
had jather he faid lofe the fhip, the voyage, and his 
life, and all ; and fo away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ftay behind now, than I 
was to perfuade them not to go before ; fo, in (hort, the 
captain ordered two men to ro^ back the pinnance, and , 
fetch twelve men more from the fhip, leaving the long- 
boat at an anchor ; and that when they came back, iix 
men fhould keep the two boats, and fix more come after 
us ; fo that he left only fixteen men in the fhip ; for the 
whole fhip '5 company confifted of 65 men, whereof twb 
were loft in the firft quarrel which brought this mifchief 
,0n. 

Being now on the march, you may be fure we felt 
. little of the ground we trod on; and being guided by 
\the . fire, we kept no path, but went diredly to the 
place of the flame. If the noife of the guns were 
furprifmg to»4i5 before, tht cries of the poor people 
were now quite of ai§pther nature, and filled us with

had an idea, 0/ the thing itfelf before ; nor is it poiiible 
to defcribe it, or the hjorror which was upon our minds 
at hearing it. 

Hpwever we went on, and at length, came to the 
town, though there was no entering the ftreets of it 
for the fire. The firft objedl we met with, was the 
ruins of a hut or houfe, or rather the a(he§ of it, for the 
houfe was confumed; and jull before it, plain now 
to be feen by the light of the fire, lay four men and 
three women killed ; and as we thought, one or two 
more lay in the heap among the fire. In fhort, thefe 
were fuch inilances of rage altogether barbarous, and 
of a fury fomething beyond what was human, that we 
thought it impoffible our men could be guilty of it ; or 
if they were the authors of it, we tljonght that every 
or e of them ought to be put to the worlt of deaths : but 
dii* was not all ; we fiaw the Urc increafed forward, and 
the cry went on juflas the fire went on, fo that we were 
in the utmofl confufion. We advance^ a little way far- 
ther; and beheld to our aftonifhment, three women 
naked, crying in a moft dreadful manner, and flying ^s 
if they had, indeed, had wii^gs, and after them, fixteen 
or fevjsntcen men, natives, in the fame terror and confler-

made pitecu 3 fomentations to us to fave them which wc

together in a huddle, clofe behind us, for proteftion. 
I left my men drawn up together, and charged them tp 
hurt nobody, but, if polTible, to get at forae of our 
peopki and fee what devil it was poffefTed them, and 
whdt they intended to do; and, in a word, to com- 
~mand them off; afluring them, thatif they ftayed till 
day-light, they would have a hundred thoufand men 
about their ears: I fay I left them, and went .among 
thofe flying people, taking only two of our men vvitn 
me; and. there was, indeed, a piteous fpe(5^acle among 
them ; fome of them had their feet terribly burnt witii 
trampling and running through the fire ; others their 
hands^burnt, one of the women had fallen down in the 
£re, and was almoft burnt to death before Ihe could 
get out again ; two or three of the men had cuts in 
their backs and thighs, from our men purfuing, and 
another was (hot through* the body, and died while I - 
was there. 

J would fain have learned what the octafion of ,ali

heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered witli blood

when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could 
halloo; and, with much ado, one of them made them

1 confefs I was urged then myfelf, and at another 
lime fhould have Been forward enough : but I thought 
they had carried their rage too far, and thought of 
Jacob's words to his fons Simeon and Levi, * Cuned be 
their anger, for it was fierce; and* their wrath, for it 
was cruel.' But I had now anew talk upon my hands-; 
for when the men I carried with me faw the fight, as I 
had done, I had as much to do to reflrain them, as I 
Ihould have had with the others ; nay, my nephew him- 
felf fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing^r 
that he was only concerned for fear of the men being 
<)verpowered ; for, as to the people, he thought 90t one 
of them ought to live; for they had all glutted them* 
felves with the murder of the poor man, and that they

quit out of my power to reflrain them , came away pen- 
f ive and fad : for I could not bear the fight, much leis the 
horrible noife and cries of the poor wretches that fell 
into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the fuper- 
cargo and two men, and with thefe I walked back to

confefs, to venture back, as it were alone; for, as it 
began now to be almoft day, and the alarm had rim

over die country, there flood about forty mert armed 
with lances and bows at the little place where the tweh e 
or thirteen houfes ftood mentioned before ; but by ac- 
cident I miffed the place, and came dire^ly to the fea- 
fide ; and by that time I got to the fea-fide it was broad 
day ; immediately I took the pinnace, and went aboard, 
and fent her back to affift the men in what might 
happen. 

1 obferved that about the time T came to the boat- 
fide, the fire was pretty well out, and the noife abated ; 
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I heard 
a volley of our mens fire arms, and faw a great fmoke j 
this, as I underftood afterwards, was our men falling 
upon the forty men, who, as I faid. Hood at the few 
houfes on the way ; of whom they killed 16 or 17, and 
fetal! thofe houfes on fire, but did not meddle with thof 
women or children. 

By tliat time the men got to the fhorc again witli the 
-pinnance, oar men began to appear ; ihey came drop- 
ping in, fome and fome ; not in two bodies, and in form, 
as thty went out, but all in heap*-, draggling here and 
tiere in fuch a manner, that a faiall force of refolute 
men might have cut them all oft. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole country; 
the people were amazed, and furprifed, and fo frighted, 
that I believe, an hundred of them would have Sed at 
the fight of but five of our men. Nor in all this terriole 
a^Vionwas there a man who made any confiderable de- 
fence ; they were fo furprifed between the terror of the 
fire, and the fudden attack of our men in the dark, that 
they knew not which way to turn themfelves ; for if they 
^ £ei one way, they were met by one party ; if back again, 
" b/ another ; fo that they were every where knocked 
down. Nor did any of our men receive the lead hurt, 
except one who drained his foot, and another had one 
of his hands very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, 
indeed, with all the men, in jny mind, but with him in 
particular ;. as well for his afting fo out of his duty, as

for though it is true that, they killed Thomas JelFrys.' 
yet it was as true that JefFrys was the aggrefibr, had 
broken the truce, and had violated or debauched a 
young woman of theirs, who came to our camp innocent- 
ly, and on the f/ith of their capitulation. 

The boatfwain defended this quarrel when wc were

feemed to break the truce, but really had not ; 'and that 
the war was begun the night before b/ the native*

ward-bound, he was to go up to China, and return to 
the coaft as he came home'. 

The firft difafter that befel us was in the Gulph of 
Perfia, where five of our men, venturing on (bore on 
the Arabian fide of the Gulph, were furrounded by the 
Arabs, and either all killed, or catried away into ila- 
very ; the reft of the boat's crew were not able to 
refcue them, and. "had but juft time to get off their 
/ boat ; I began to upbraid them with the jult retribution 
of heaven intlfi^cafe; but the boatfwain very warmly 
told me, he thouglit I went farther in my ccnfures than 
1 could (hew any \y.irrant for in fcripture, and referred 
to the thirteenth of St. Luke, ver. 4. where oar Saviour 
itttimates, that thofe men, on whom the Tower of Si- 
loam fell, were not finners above dl the Galileans ; but 
that which, indeed, put me to filence iq this cafe, was, 
that none of ^hefc five men, who were now loft, were of 
the number of thofe who went on ftiore to the maftacre 
of Madagafcar (fo I always called it, though our men 
>could not bear the word maffacre with any patience) 1

ftVain, who had been the head of the attempt, came 
up boldly to me one time, and told me, he found that 
I continually brought that affair upon the ftage ; that

snand in the (hip, br concern in the voyage, they were 
not obliged to bear it; that they did not know but I 
might haVe^fome ill defign in my head, and, perhaps, 
call them to an account for it, when they came to £ng. 
land ; and that therefore, unlefs I would refolve to have 
done with it, and alfo not to concern my{elf farther 
with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the fhip ; 
for he did not think it was fafe to fail with me among 
them. * 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and 
then tol^ him, that I did confef^ I had all along op- 
pofed thc^maffacre of Madagafcar, for fuch I would al- 
ways call it ; and that I had on all occafions fpokea 
my mind freelv abpu^it, though not niore upon hini 
than any of the Ife^f^nat as to nay having no command 
in the Ihip, th^l^as twe, nor did- 1 exercife any au- 
thority, only took the liberty of fpeaking my mmd in 
things which publicly concerned us all ; as to what 
concern 1 had in the voyage, that was none of his 
bufinefs ; I was a coniiderable owner of the fhip, and 
in that claim I conceived I had a right to fpeak, even 
farther than 1 bad yet done, and would not be account- 
able to him, or-any one elfe ; and began to be a little 
warm with him : he made but little reply jto me at 
that time, and I thought that aiFair had been over. 
We were at this time in the road to Bengal : and, being 
willing to fee the place, I went on ihore with the 
fupercargo, in .the Ihip's boat, to divert myfelf ; and 
towards evening. was preparing to go on board, when 
one of the men came to me, and told me, he would not 
have me trouble myfelf to comedown to the boat, for 
they had orders not to carry me on board. Anyone 
may gjuefs what a furprife I was in at fo infolent a mef- 
fage ; and I aflced the man,., who bade him deliver that 
errant to rt^e ? . He told me the cockfwain, I faid no 
more to the fellow, but bid him let tiiem know he had 
delivered his mefTage, and that I had given him no an- 
fwer to it. 

I immediately went, and found out the fupercargo^ 
and told him the flory, adding, what I prefently fore- 
faw, viz. that there' would certainly be a mutiny in the 
fhip; andinureated him t« go imiiaediately onboard the

(hip in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of it : 
but I might have fpared this intelligence, for, before I 
had fpoken to him on fhore, the matter was effected on 
board : the boatfwain, the gunner, the carpenter, and 
in a word, all the inferior ofHcers, as foon as I was gone 
off in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and de* 
fired to fpeak witii the captain ; and there the boat- 
fwain, making a long harangue (for the fellow talked 
very well,) and repeating all he had faid to me, told 
the captain in a few words, that as I was now gone 
peaceably on ihore, they were loth to ufe any vio- 
lence with me; which, if I had not gone on (hore, they « 
would otherwiie have done, to oblige me to have 
gone. They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they 
(hipped themfelves to^ ferv e in the (hip under his com- 
mand, they would perform it faithfully : but if I would 
not quit the fhip, or the captain oblige me to quit it, 
they would all leave the fhip, and fail no iarther with, 
him : and at that word ALL, he turned his face about 
Howards the main -mail, which was, it feems, the iignal 
agreed on between them ; at which all the feamen being 
got together, they cried out, One and ALL, One and 
ALL. 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of fpirit, and of 
great prefence of mind ; and though he was furprifed, 
ypu may be fure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly 
he would confider ofthe matter; but that he could do 
nothing in it till he had fpoken to me about it : he ufed 
fome arguments with them, to fhew them the unreafon- 
ablenefs and injuftice of the thing ; but it was all in 
vam; they fwore, and Ihook hands round, before his 
face, that they would go all on ihore, unlefs he would 
engage to them not to fuffer me to come on board the 
ihip. 

This was an hard article upon him, ^ho Itnevv his 
obligation to me, and did not know how I might take 
it ; fo he began to talk cavalierly to them ; told them, 
that I was a confiderable owner of the fhip, and 
that in juftice he could not put me out of my own 
houfe ; that this was next door to ferving me as the fa- 
mous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny in 
he ihip, fet the captain on fhore in an uninhabited

ifland, and ran away with the (hip : that let them go 
into what (hip they woulJ> if ever they came to Eng- 
land again, it wcmld coil them dear ; that the (hip was 
-mine, and that he would not pat me out of it : and that 
he would rather lofe the (hip, and the voyage too, thaic 
difoblige me fo much ; fo they mij;ht do as they pleaf- 
. ed. However, he would go on Aore, and talk with* 
me there ; and invited the boatfwain to go with him, 
and perhaps they might accomodate the inatter with 
me. 

But they all rejcfted the propofal i and faid, they 
would have nothing to do with me no m«re, neither 
on board, nbron(hore ; and if I came on board, they 
would go on (hore. Well faid the captain, if you are 
all of this mind lee me go on (hore, and talk with him ; 
fo away he came to me with this account, a little after 
the meifage had been brought to me from the cock-^ 
fvvain. 

I was very glad to fee my nephew, I mud confefs 4 
for 1 was not without apprehenfions that thcy-would 
confine him by violence, fet fail, and run away with 
the (hip ; and then I had been ftript naked in a remote 
country, and nothing cO help myfelf : in (hort, I had 
been in a worfe cafe than when I was all alone in the 
iiland. 

But they had not come to that length, it feems, to my 
great fatisfadtion ; and when my nephew told me what 
they had faid to him, and how they had (worn, and 
Ihook hands, that they would one and all leave the 
(hip, if I was fuffered to come on buard, I told him, he 
ihould not be concerned at it at all, for I would ftay oa 
fhgre : 1 only defired he would take care and fend me 
.all my necelTary things oii (hore, and leave me a fui^ici- 
ent fum of money, and I would find my way to Eng- 
land as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but 
there was' no^vay to helg^it, but to comply with it. 
So in (hort, he went on board the (hip again, and fatif« 
fied the men, that his uncje ^ad yielded to their im- 
portunity, and had fent for his goods from' on board 
the (hip. So the matter was over in a very few 

hour? :

hours ; the men returned to their duty, and I begun to ** 
confider what courfe T ihould fteer. 

I was now alone in the remoteft part of the world, 
as I think I may call it , for I was. near three thoufand 
leagues, byfea, farther off from England, than I was 
at my ifland ; only, it is true, I might travel here by 
land oyer the Great Mogul's country to Surat, mighj 
go from thence to Baflbra by fea, up the Gulph of 
Perfia, and from thence might take the way of the ca- 
ravans, over the defcrts of Arabia to Aleppo and Sca'n- 
deroon ; froi^ thence by fea again to Italy, and fo over 
land into Frahce : and this, put together, might be, at 
leaft, a full diameter of the globe ; but, if ^t Micre to be 
meafured, I fuppofe it would appear to be a great deal 
more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for 
fomc Englifh Ihips, which were coming to Bengal, from 
Achin, on the ifland of Sumatra, and get paflage on 
board them for England : but as I came hither without 
any concern with the Englifh Eafl-India company, fo it 
would be dilEcult to go from hence without their 
licence, unlefs with great favour of the captains of the 
ihips, or of the c6mpany's factors ; and to both I was 
an utter ilranger: 

Here I had the particular pleafure^ fpeaking by con- 
trarities, to fee the fhip fet fail without me; a treat- 
ment, I think, a man in my circumftances fcarce ever 
met with, except from pirates running away with a 
fhip, and fetting thofe that would not agree with their 
villainy on fhore ; indeed this was the next door to 
it, both ways : however, my nephew left me two ferr 
vants, or rather^ one companion, and one fervant ; 
the firfl was clerk to the purfer, whom he engaged to 
go with me; and the other was his own fervant : I 
took me alfo a good lodging in the houfe of an Eng- 
filh woman, where fevcral mere/ ants lodged, feme 
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one Englifh- 
man. Here I was handfomely enough entertained ; and 
that I might not be faid to run rafhly upon any thing, I 
flayed hereaboVje nine months, confidering what courfe 
to take, and how to manage myfelf ; 1 had fom Englifh

money, my nephew fumiftiing me with' a thoufan* 
pieces of of eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I 
had occafion, that 1 might not be flraitened, whatever 
might happen* 

I quickly difpofed of my goods, and to advantage 
too ; and, as I originally intended, I bought here fomc 
very good diamonds, which, of all other Uiings was the 
moft proper for me, in my circumftances, becaufe I 
might always carry my whole eftate about me. 

After a long ftay here, and many propofals made for 
my return to England ; but none falling to my mindr 
the Engliih merchant, who lodged with me, and with 
whom I had contradted anbtimate acquaintance, came 
to me one mommg i Countryman, fays he, I have a- 
projed to communicate to you, which, a9 it fuits with 
my thoughts, may, for aught I know, fuit with your's 
alfo, when you fhall have thoroughly confidered it. 

Here we are polled, fays he, you by accident> and I 
by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote 
from pur own country ; but it is in a countryi where, by 
118 who underhand trade and bufinefs, a great deal of 
money is to be got : if you will put a thoufand pounds 
to my thoufand pounds, we will hire a fhip here, the 
firft we can get to our minds ; you (hall be captain. 111 
be merchant ; and we will go a trading voyage to China ^ 
for ^hat (hould we (land (till for ? The whole world is 
in motion, rolling round and round ; all the creatures 
of God, heavenly bodies, and earthly, are bufy and dili- 
gent : why (hould* we be idle ? There are no drones> 
fays he, living in the world but men ; why (hould we 
be of that number ? 

I liked this propofal very well, and the more, becaufe 
it feemedtobe expre(red with fo much good will, and 
in fo friendly a manner ; I will not fay but that I might, 
by my loo(e and unhinged circumftances, be the litter 
to embrace a propofal for trade, and, indeed^ for any" 
thing ehe ; or otherwiTe, trade was none of my element : 
however, I might, perhaps, fay, with feme truth, that 
if trade was not my element, rambling was ; ^and no pro- 
pofal for feeing any part of the world which I had never 
leen before^ could poflibly come amifs to me»

It was y however. Tome tiise before we could get a 
ftiip to our mind 5 and when we got a veflel it was not 
eafy to get Englilh faitors ; that is to fay, fo many as 
were neceflary to govern the voyage, and manage the 
failors which we fhould pick up there ; after fome time 
we got a mate, a boatfwain, and a gunner, Englifh ; a 
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguefe foremaH^nen ; 
with thefe, we found we could do well enough, having 
Indian feamen, fach as they are, to make up. 

There are fo many travellers who have written the 
hiftory of their voyages and travels this way, that it 
would be but very litde diverfion to any body, to give 
alongaccountof the places we went to, and the people 
who inhabit there ; thofe things I leave to others, and 
refer the reader to thofe journals and travels of Englifh- 
men, many of which, I find, are publifhed, and more 
promifed every day : it is enough for me to tell you, 
that we made the voyage to Achin, in the ifland of 
Sumatra, firfl ; and from thence to Siam, where we ex* 
changed fome of our wares for opium, and for fome 
arrack ; the firfl, a commodity which bears a great price 
among the Chinefe, and which, at that time, was very 
much wanted there : in a word,. we went up to Suiham, 
made a very great voyage, were eight months put, and 
returned to Bengal ; and I was very well fatisfied with 
my adventure. I obferve that our people in England 
often admire how the officers, which the company fc^tfd 
into India, and the merchants which generally flay there 
get fuch very good eflates as they do, and fometimes 
come home worth fixty, feventy, and an hundred thou- 
fand pounds at a time^. \ ' 

But it is no wonder, or, at leaft, we fhall fee fo much 
farther into it, when we confider the innumerable ports 
and places where they have a free commerce, that it will 
then be no wonder ; and much lefs will it be fo, when 
we confider, that at all thofe places and ports where the 
Englifli fhips come, there is fo much, and fuch conftant 
demand for the growth of all other countries, that there 
is a certain vent for the return, as well as a market a- 
broad for the goods carried out. 

In fhort, we made a very good voyage, and I got fo

into the method of getting more, that, had I been twenty, 
years. younger, I fhould have been tempted to have ih\d 
here, and fought no farther for making my fortune : but 
what was all this to a man on the ^Tong iide of three- 
fcore ; that was rich enough, and came abroad more in 
obedience to a reftlefs defire of feeing the world, than a 
covetous defire of getting in it ? And, indeed, I think, 
it is with great juHice that I now call it a reillefs defire ; 
for it was fo : when 1 was at home, I was refilefs to go 
abroad; and now. I was abroad, I was relUefs to be at 
home, i fay, what was this gain to me ? I was rich 
enough already ; nor had I any uneafy defires about 
getting more money ; and therefore^ the profits of the 
voyage to me, were things of no great force to me, for 
the prompting me forward to farther undertakings : 
hence I thought, that by this voyage I had made no 
progrefs at all i becaufe I was come back, as I might call - 
it, to the place from whence I came» as to an Tiome ; 
whereas my eye, which, like that which Solomon fpeaks 
of, was never fatbfied with feeing, was ftill more defirous 
of wandering and feeing. I wa^ come into a part of the 
world which I never was in before , and that part in par- 
ticular which I hadjieard much of; and was refolvedrto 
fee as nfuch of it as I could ; and then I thought I might 
fa^, I had feen all the world that was worth feeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions ; 
I do not name this to infifl upon my own, for I acknow- 
ledge his was moft juft, and the mofl fuited to the end of 
a merchant's life ; who, when he is abroad upon adven- 
tures, it is his wifdom to flick to that, as the befl thing 
' for him, which he is like to get the moft money by 2 
my new friend kept himfelf to the nature of the things 
and would have been content to have gone like a car- 
rier's horfe, always to the fame inn, backward and; for- 
ward, prodded he could, as he called it^ find his ac- . 
count i|i it: on the other hand, mine, oM as I was, was 
the notionof a mad rambling boy, that never cares to fee 
* thing twice over. 

But this was not^all: I had a kind of imj^tience 
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the moft uniettlfd'

Upon the fearch for bufinefs, propofed another voyage 
to me, viz. among the fpice-illands ; and to bring home 
a load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; , 
places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the iflands 
belong partly tp tlie Spaniards ; though we went riot fo 
far, but to feme other, where they have not the whole 
power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were 
not long in preparing for this voyage ; the chief difficul- 
ty was m bringing me Co come into it ; however, at lafl: . 
nothing elfe offering, and finding that really^ ilirring 
about and trading, the profit being fo great, and, as I 
may fay, certain, had more pleafure in it, and more fa- 
tisfadlion to the mind, thail fitting ftill ; which, to me 
erpecially, was the unhappieft part of life, I refolved Oft 
this voyage too ; which we made very fucccfsfully, 
touching at Bornep, and feveral iflands, whofe names I 
do not remember, and came home in about five months : ' 
we fold our fpice, which was chiefly cloves, and fome 
nutmegs, tothePerfiap merchants, who carried them 
away for the Gulph ; and making near five of cnc, we 
xeally got a great deal of money . 

My friend, when we made up this account, fmiled at 
me ; Well now, faid he, with a fort of an agreeable ia- 
fult upoti my indolent temper, is not this better than 
walking about here, like a man of nothing to do, and 
fpending our time in flaring at the nonfenie and igno- 
rance of the Pagans ? Why truly, faid I, my friend,'! 
think it is ; and I begin to be a convert to the princjlples 
of merchandizing ; but, I mull tell you, faid, by the 
way, you do not know what I am doing ; for if once 
1 conquer my back wardnefs, and embark heartily, as old

But to be ihort with my fpeculations ; a little while

was a coafler, not an European trader, and of about

I can tell you but part of the ftory, fir, fays he ; but 
I have a Dutch fearaan here with me, and, 1 believe, I 
could perfuade him to - tell you the reft ; but there is 
fcarce time for it : but the Ihort of the ftory isf this, the 
fir ft part of which, I fuppole, you know well enough, 
viz. That you were with this fhip at Sumatra ; that 
there your captain was murdered, by the MaUaccans, 
with three of his men; and that you, or fome of thofe 
that were on board with you, ran away With the Ihip, 
and are fince turned PIRATES. This is the fum of 
th^ ftory,- and you wiU all be feized as pirates, I can 
alTure you, and executed with very little ceremony ; for 
you know merchants (hips fhew but little law topi- 
rates, if diey get them in their power. 

Now you Q)eak plain £ngli(h, faid J, and I thank 
you ; and though I know nothine that we have done, 
like what you ulk of, but I am Aire we came honeftly^ 
and fairly by the fhip, yet, ' feeing fuch work is a 
doing, as you fay, and that you feem to mean honeftly, 
I will be upon my guard. Nay, fir, fays he, do not 
talk of bemg upon your guard ; the beft defence is to 
be out ofthe danger ; if you have any regard to your 
life, and the lives of all your men, put out to fea, 
without fail at high-water ; and as you have a whole tide 
before you, you will be gone too far out before they 
can come down ; for they will come away at high- 
water ; and as they have twenty miles to come, you'U 
get near two hours of them by the difference of the 
tide, not reckoning the length of the way. Befides, 
Xs fhey are only boats, and not (hips, they will not 
venture to follow yoii far out to fea, efpecially if it 
i^lows. 

Well,faid I', you have been very kind in this : What 
fhall I do for you, to make you amends ? Sir, fays he, 
you may not be fp willing to make me ansLends, be^ 
caufe youittay not be convinced of the truthofit; I 
wHl make an offer to you ; I have nineteen moiithfi-pay .^

four pay. to us, we will go along with you ; if you find 
nothing more in it, e will deiire no more ; but if we 
do convince you, that we have faved your life, and the

I confented to this readily ; and went immediately on 
board, and the two men with me. As foon as I came 
to the (hip fide, my partner who was on board, came 
out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great 
deal of joy, O ho I Olio I we have flopped the leak I 
we have ftopped the leak I Say you fo, faid I, thank 
God ; but weigh the anchor then immediately : Weigh ! 
{ays he ; What do you mean by that ? What is the niat- 
ter ? fays he. Aik no qiieftions, laid I, but all hands 
to work, and weigh, without lofing a minute : He was 
^ furprifed : But however he called the captain, and he, ^ 
immediately ordered the anchor to be ^ot up ; and 
though the tide was not quite done; yet a little land- 
breeze blowing, we Hood out to fea: then I called him 
into the cabin, and told him the ilory at large ; and we 
called in the men, and they told us the reft of it; but as 
it took us up a great deal of time, fo before we had done, 
a Teamen comes to the cabin door, and calls out to us 
that the captain bade him tell us, we were chafed : 
Chafed, fakl I, by whom and by what ? By five '(loops, 
or boats, faid the fellow, full of men. Very well, faid 
I ; then it is apparent there is fomething in it. In the ^ 
nextplace, I ordered all our men to be called up ; and 
^old tkem, that there was a defign to feize the fhip, 
and to take us for pirates; and afked them, if they: 
would fland by us, and by on© another, ? The men an-

die with us. . Then I afked the captain, what way he 
thought befl for us to manage a fight with them : For, 
*cfift them I refolved'we would, and that to the laft

The gunner had in the mean time, orders to bring 
two ^uns to bear fore and aft, out of the fteerage, to 
clear the deck, and load them with mufquet-bullets, and 
fmall pieces of old iron, and what next came to hand ; 
and thus we made ready for fight : but all this while kept 
out to fea, with wind enough, and could fee the boats at 
a diilance, bemg five laree long-boats following us, widi 
all the fail they could make. 

Two of thefe boats, which by our glaffes, we could 
fee, were Englifti, had outfailcd the reft, were near two 
leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us confiderably; 
fo that we fired they would come up with us : upon 
which we found a gun without a {hot, to intimate that 
they fhould bring to : and we put out a flag of truce^ 
as a fignal for parley : but they kept crowding after 
us, till they came within (hot ; upon this we took in 
our white flag, they having made no anfwer to it, 
hung out the red flag, and fired at them with (hot : Not- 
withftanding this, they came on till they were near 
enough to call to them with a fpeaking trumpet, which 
we l^d on board : fo we called them, and bade them 
keep off at their peril. 

It was all one, they crouded after us, and endeavour- 
ed to come under our ftern, fo to board us on our quar- 
ter : Upon which, feeing they were refolute for mif* 
chief, and depended upon the ftrength that followed 
them, I ordered to bring the fhip to, fo that they lay 
upon our broadfide, when immediately we fired five 
guns at them : one of them had been leyelled fo true as 
to carry away the ftern of the hindermoft boat, and 
bring them to the neceflity of uking down their fail, 
and running all to the head of the boat to keep her 
from finking : fo (he lay by, ai^ had enough of it ; 
but, feeing the foremoft boat ftill crowd on after us, W€ 
made ready to fire at her in particular. 

While this was doing, one of three boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made 
up to the boat which we had difabled, to relieve her, and 
we could afterwards fee h«r take out the men : we called

ting quickly ready again, fired among thrm a fecond

itfelf, yet fell in among the men, and we could eafily 
fee^ had done a great deal of mifchief among them ; 
but we, taking no notice of that, weared the fhip again, 
and brought our quarter to bear upon them ; and, firing 
three guns more, we found the boat was fpUt t^lmoft to 
pieces ; in particular, her rudder, and a piec^ of her 
ftern, was fhct quite away ; fo they handed iheir fail 
immediately, and were in great diforder ; but, to com- 
plete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at 
them agab ; wh^re he hit them we could not tell, but 
we found the boat was finking, and fome of the men 
already in the water ; upon this I immediately manned 
cut our pinnance, which we had kept clofe by our fide, 
with orders to pick up fome of the men, if they could, 
and fave then> from drowning, and immediately to come 
.on board with them ; becaufe we faw the refl of the 
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace, 
followed their orders, and took up three men ; one of 
which was juil drowning, and it was a good while be- 
,fore w^ could recover him. As foon as they were on 
board, we crowded all the fail we could make, and 
ftood farther out to fea ; and we found,; that when the 
other three boats came up to the firft two, they gave 
'over their chice. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I 
knew not the reafon of it, yet feemed to be much 
greater thanyl apprehended ; I took care that we would 
change our courfe, and not let any one imagine whitncr 
we were going ; fo we ftood out to fea eaftward, quite 
out of the courfe of all European fhips, whether they 
were bound to China, or any where elfe, within the 
commerce of the European nations.

low that folcl us the fhip, as we faid, was no more than 
a thief, that had run away with her. Then he told us 
how the captain, whofe name too he mentioned, though 
I do not remember it now, was treacheroufly murdered 
by the natives on the coaft of Malacca, with three of his 
men ; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, goc 
into the woods, wh^re they wandered about a great 
while; till at length, he in particular, in a miraculous 
manner, made his efcape, and fwam off to a Dutch fhip, 
which failing near the ihore, in its way from China, had 
fent their boat on Ihore for frelh water ; that he durft 
not come to that part of the (hore wkerethe boat was, 
but made Ihift in the night, to take in the water farther 
off, and, fwimming a great while, at laft'the fhip's boat 
tookhkn up. 

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two 
ofthe^feamen belonging to the fhip had arrived, hav- 
ing defcrted the refl in their travels ; and gave an ac- 
count, that the fellow who had run away with the fhip, 
fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates, which were gone a 
crui/ing in her ; and that they had already taken an 
Englifh fhip, and two Dutch fhips, very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us diredlly, and 
though we knew it to be falfe, yet, as my partner faid, 
very well, if we had fallen into their hands, and they 
had fuch a pronoffeffion againft us before hand, it had 
been in vain ror us to have defended ourfelves, or to 
hope for any good quarters at their hands, efpecially 
confidering that our accufers had been^our judges, and 
that we could have expefted nbthing from them but 
what rage would have didated, and ungoverned paffion 
have executed : and therefore it was his opinion, we 
ihould godire(5Uy back to Bengal, from whence we tame 
without putting in at any port whatever ; becaufe there 
we could give an accoimt of ourfelves, and could prove 
where we were when the fhip put in, whom we bought 
hex of, and the like : and which was^more than all the 
reft, if we were put to the neceflity of bringing it before

that we kept ourfclves from being infulted by them fc* 
veral ways. 

We were in a fmall river of this country, within a 
few leagues of its utmofb limits northward ; and by 
our boat we coafted north-eall to the point of land 
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin ; ^andit was 
in this beating up along the fhore, that we difcovered as 
above> that in a word, we were furrounded with ene- 
mies. The people we were among were the moil bar- 
barous of all the inhabitants of the coad ; having no 
correfpondence with any other nation, and dealing only 
in iifh and oil, and fuch grofs commodities ; . and it, 
iHay be particularly feeni that they are, as I faid, the 
mcft barbarous of any of the inhabitants ; viz. that 
among other cudoms they have this one, that if any 
veffel had the misfortune to be fhipwrecked upon their 
coafl, they phefently make the men all prifoners ; that 
is to fay, flaves j and it was not long before we found 
a fpice of their kmdnefs thijs way, on the occafion fol- 
lowing. 

I have obferved above, that our fhip fprung a leak 
at Tea, and that we could not find it out ; and however 
it happened, that, as I have faid, it was flopped unex- 
pededly, in the happy minute of our being to be feized 
by the Diuch and EngHQi fhips, near the bay of biam ; 
yet, as we did not find the ihio.' o perfeftly tight and 
found as we defined, ^ we refolved, while we were irf this 
place, to lay her on (here, take out what heavy things 
we had on board, which were not many, and to wafti 
and clean her bottom ; and, if poilible, to find out where 
the leaks were 

Accordingly, having lightened the Ihip, and brought 
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one fide, 
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her 
bottom : for, on fecond thoughts, we did not care to 
lay her dry aground, neither could we find out a pro- 
place for it. 

The inhabitants , who had never been acquainted with 

fuch a fight, came wondering down to the fhore to 

look at us : and feeing the ihip lie down on one fide 

in a fuch a manner, and heeling towards the (hore, and

t&tti, with ftages, and with their boats on the ofF fide, 
they prefently concluded that the Ihip was caft away, 
and lay fo very fait on the ground. 

On this fuppolition they came all about us in two or 
three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats, having 
ibmaof them eight, Tome ten men in a boat, intending, 
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the 
' ihip, and iFthey had found us there, to have carried us 
ausiy fbr flaves to their king, or whatever they call him, 
for we knew not who was their governor. 

When they came up to the Ihip, and began to row 
round her, they diicovered us all hard at work, on the 
outfide of the (hip's bottom and fide, wafhing, And 
graving, and flopping, as every feafaring man knows 
how. 

They flood for awhile gazmg at us, and we, who 
were a little furprifed, could not imagine what their 
defign was ; but, being willing to be fure, we took 
this opportunity to get fopie of us into the ihip, and 
others to hand down ariiis and ammunition, to thofe 
that were at work to defend themfelves with, if there 
fhould ^be occafion : and it was no more than need : 
fbr, in lefs than a quarter of an hour's confultation, 
they agreed, it feems, that the fhip was really a wreck : 
that we were all at work, endeavouring to fave her, or 
to fave our lives by the help of our boats : and when 
we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, 
by that motion, tha't we were endeavouring to fave 
ibme of our goods. Upon this they took it for granted 
they ^11 belonged to them : and away they came di- 
redlly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of 
battle. 

Our men, feeing fo many of them, begaif to be 
frighted ; for we lay but in an ill poflure to fight, and cried 
out to us to know what they fhould do. I imme- 
diately called to the men who worked upon the flaget 
to flip them down, and get up the fide into the 
fhip : and bade thofe in the boat to row, round and 
come on board : and thofe few of us who were on 
board, worked with all the flrength and hands we 
had, to bring the fhip to rights : but, however, neither

The firft man they laid hold of was an EnglifKTeaman, 
a flout ftrong felfow, who having a mufquet in his h^nd, 
never oiFered to fire it, but laid ic down in the boat, like 
a fool, as 1 ihought. But he underflood his bufinefs bet- 
ter than 1 could teach him ; for he grappled the Pagan, ' 
and dragged him by main force out of their own boat 
into ours ; where, taking him by die two' ears, he beat 
his head fo againil the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died 
inftantly in his hands ; and in the meantime, a Dutch- 
man, who Hood next, took up the mufquet, and with 
the but-end of it, fo laid about him, that he knockei 
down five of them, who attempted to enter the bt)at ; 
but thin was little towards refifling thirty or forty men, 
who fearlefs, becaufe ignorant of their danger, began to 
throw themfelves into the long-boat, where we had but 
five men to defend it ; but one accident gave our men a 
complete vidlory, which defervcd our laughter rather 
than any thing elfe ; and that was this : - 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outfide of 
the (hip, as well as to pay the feams where he had caulk- 
ed her, to Hop the leaks, had got two kettles juft let 
down into the boat ; one filled uith boiling pitch, and 
the other with rofin, tallow, and oil, and futh Huff as 
the fhipwrights ufed for that work ; and the man that 
tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, 
with which he fupplied the men that were at work with 
that hot fluff; two of the enemy's men entered the 
boatjuH where this fellow flood, being in the fore 
Iheets ; he immediately faluted them with a ladleful of 
the fluff, boiling hot, which fo burnt and fcalded them, 
beiiig half-naked, that they roared out like two bulls, 
and enraged with the fire, leaped both into the fea. 
Tihc carpenter faw it, and cried out. Well done Jack,

not only as it was aperfedl furprife to me, and that our 
danger was imminent before ; but as we got this victory 
without any bloodfhed, except of that man the ftilo^ 
killed with his naked hands, and which I was very much 
concerned at : for I was fick of killing fuch poor fa v age 
wretches, even though it was in my own. defence, know- 
ing, they came on errads which they thought juft, and 
knew no better ; and that though it may be a jull thing, 
becaufe necefTary, for there is no necefHiry wickedncfs

be always obliged to be killing our fellow creatures to

but we fhould be furrounded the next day with rogues

We, therefore, got all our things on board the iame

the mean time, lying at an anchor fome diilance from 
the fhore, we were not fo much concerned, being now 
in a lighting pofture, as well as in a failing pofture, if 
any enemy had prefented. The next day, having finifh-^ 
cd our work within board, and finding our fhip was 
perfedly healed of all her leaks, we fet fail ; we would 
have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to 
inform ourfelves of what was to be known concerning

When we were thus got to fea, we kept on N. E. as

From hence we faiied ftill north, keeping the coaft 
of China at an equal diftancei till we Knew we were 
beyond all the ports of China, where our European 
(hips ufually come : being refolved, if poffible, not to 
fall into any of their hands, efpecially in this country,

being entirely ruined : nay, fo great was my fear in par- 
ticular, as to my being taken by them, that I believe 
firmly I would much rather have chofen to fall into the 
hands of the Spaniih inquifition. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 
refolved to pat into the firll trading port we Ihbuld come 
at ; ^nd, (landing in for the fhore, a boat came off two 
leagues to us, with an old Portuguefe pilot on board, 
who, knowing us to be an European Ihip, came to offer 
his fervice, which, indeed, we were very glad of, and 
took him on board : upon which, without afking us 
wiiither we would go, he difraifTed the boat he came in, 
and fent it back. • 

I thought it was now fo much In our choice to make 
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began to 
talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph of Nan- 
quin, which is the moll northern part of the coail of 
China. The old man faid he knew the Gulph of Nan- 
quin very well ; but> fmiling, aiked us what we would 
do there. 

I told him we would fell our cargo, and purchafe ^ 
China wares, callicoes, raw filks, tea, wrought filks.

He told us our befl port h^d been to have put in at Ma- 
cao, where we could not fail of a market for our opium, 
to our fatisfa6lion, and might, for our money, have 
purchafed all forts of China goods, as cheap as we could 
at Nanquin, , 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told

U5 up to the city of Nanquin, from whcncQ. we can travel 
to Pekin afterwards ? Yes, he faid, he could do fo 
very well, and there was a great Dutch fhip gone up that 
way jufl before. This gave me a little fhock ; a Dutch 
ihip- was now our terror, and we had much rather have 
met the devil, at leaft if he had not come in too fright- 
ful a figure : we depended upon it, that a Dutch fhip- 
would be our deftrudlion, for we were in no conditioUi 
to fight them ; all the fliips they trade with in thofe parts, 
being of great burden, and of much greater force than^ 
we were. 

. The old man foi^nd nie a little confufed, and under 
fome concern, when he named a Dutch Ihip ; and faid 
to me. Sir, you need be under no apprehenfion of the- 
Dutch, I fuppofe they are not now at war with your na- 
tion. No, faid I, that's true ; but I know not what li- 
berties men may take, when the} are out of the reach, 
of the Jaws of the country. Why,, faid he, you are na 
jXrates, what need you fear ? , They will not meddle 
with peaceable merchants fure. 

If I had any blood- in my body that did not fly up mta* 
my face at that word, it was hindered by fome ftop In- 
the velfels appointed by nature to circulate it ; for it 
put me into thegreateft diforder and confufion imaginable 
nor was it poffible for me to conceal it fo> but that 
the old man eafily perceived it* 

Sir, faid he, I find you are in fome diforder in your

wKitKer to go in particular ; and I am fomething more - 
fo, for "what you faid about pirates : I hope there are^no 
pirates in thefe feas, we are but in an ill condition to meet 
with them : for you fee we have but fmali force, and but 
very weakly manned. 

O, Sir, faid he, do not be concerned, I do not know 
that there have been any pirates in thefe feas thefe fifteen 
years, except one, which was feen, as J hear, in the bay 
of Siam, about a month fmce ; but you may be afTured 
fhe is gone to the fouthward : nor was (he a Ihip of any 
great force, or fit for the, work : fhe was not built for si 
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew 
that were on board, after the captain and fome of his v 
men had been murdered by the Malaccans, at or near 
the ifland of Sumatra. 

What I faid I, feeming to know nothing of the matter* . 
Did they murder the captain ? No, faid he, I do not 
underftand that they murdered him : but, as they after- 
wards ran away with the fhip^ it is generally believed 
they betrayed. him into the hands of the Malaccans, who 
did murder him : and, perhaps, they procured them to 
doit. Why then, faid I, they deferve death> as much 
as if they had done it themfelves* Nay, faid the old 
man, they do deferve it : and they will certainly have it 
if they light upon any Englifh or Dutch fhip ; for they 
have all agreed together, that, if they meet that rogue, 
they will give him no quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the pirate is gone out of 
thefe feas ; how can they meet with him them ? Why> 
that is true, faid he, they do fay fo : but he was, as I 
tell you, in the bay of Siam in the river Cambodia, and 
was difcovered there by fome Dutchmen who belonged 
to the (hip, and who were left on fhore when they run 
away with her ; and fome Englifh and Dutch traders J}e* 
ing in the river, they were within a little of taking him. 
Nay, faid he, if the foremoft boats had been wellfecond^- 
ed by the' reft, they had certainly taken him : but he, 
finding only two boats within reach of him, tacked about 
and fired at thefe two, and difabled them, before the other 
came up ; and then ftanding off to fea, the others were 
not able to follow him, and fo he got away. But they 
have all fo exadt a defcription of the fhip that they 



^ 



S04 ADVENTURESOF 

will be fare to know him ; and where-ever they find 
him, they have vowed to give no quarter to either the 
captain, or the feamen, but to hang them all up at the 
yard-arm. 

What I faid I, w\ll they execute them right or wrong, 
hang them firll, and judge them afterwards ? O, Sir ! 
feid the old pilot, there is no need to make a formal bu- 
iinefs of it with fuch rogues as thofe ; let them tie them 
back to back, aiHi fet then^a diving ; it is no more than 
they rightly deferve. ^ 

I knew I had my old man faft aboard, and that he 
could do me no harm ; fo that I turned fhort upon him: 
Well, now. Seignior, faid I, and this is the very reafon 
] why I would "have you carry us to Nanquin, and not to 
put back to Macao, or to any other part of the coun- 
try, where the Englifh or Dutch fhips come : for, be it 
known to you. Seignior, thofe captains of the Englifh 
and Dutch fhips are a parcel of rafh, proud, infolent 
fellows, that neither know what belongs tojuflice, or 
how to behave themfelves, as the laws of God and na- 
ture direft ; but being proud of their offices, and not 
imderflanding their ppwer, they would aft the murder- 
ers to punifh robbers ; would take upon them to infult 
men falfly accufed, and determine them guilty without 
due enquiry , and perhaps I may live to call fome of 
them to an account for^t, where they may be taught 
how jufHce i« to be executed ; and that no man ought to 
be treated as a criminal till fome evidence may be had 
of the crime, and that he is the man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very fhip they 
had attacked : and gave him a full account of the fkir- 
miOi we had with their boats, and how foolifhly and 
coward-hke they had behaved. I told him all the flory 
of our buying the fhip, and how the Dutchmen ferved 
us. I told him the reafpns I had to believe .that this 
ftory of killing the m after by the Malaccans was not 
true ; as alfo therunning away with the fhip : but that 
it was all a fiftion of their own, to fuggefl that the meti 
were turned pirates ; and they ought to have been fure 
it was fo, l^pfore they had ventured to attack us by fur- 
prife^ and oblige us to refift them ; adding, that they 

-^ , , would 



f 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ••$ 

would have the blood of thofe men, who were killed 
there, in our jufi: defence, to anfwer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation ; and told 
us, we were very much in the, right to go away to 
the north ; and that if he might advife us, it fhould be 
to fell the fhip in China, which we might very well do, 
and buy o^ build another in the country : and, faid he, 
tho' you will not get fo good a Ihip, yet you may get 
, one able enough to carr;^ you and all your goods back 
again to Bengal, or any where clCe. ^ 

I told him I would take his advice, when I came to 
any port where I could find a fhip for my turn, or get 
any cuftomer to buy this. He replied, I (hould meet 
with cuftomers enough for the fhip at Nanquin, and that 
*a Chinefe junk would ferve me very well to go back, 
again ; and that he would procure me people both to buy 
one, and fell the other. 

Well, but. Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know the 
ihip fo well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your meafures, 
be inflrumental to bring fome honeft%innocent men into 
a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be muraered in cold blood; 
for where-ever they find the fhip they will prove the 
guilt upon the men, by proving this was the fhip : 
and fo innocent men may probably be overpowered and 
murdered. Why, faid the old man, I'll find out a way 
to prevent that alfo : for as 1 know all thofe commanders 
youfpeak of very well, and fhall fee them all as they 
pafs by, I will be fure to fet them to rights in the thing, 
and let them know that they had been fo much in the 
wrong: that though the people who were on board at 
iirfl might run away with the fhip, yet it was not true 
that they had turned pirates : and that in particular thofe 
were not the men that firfl went off with the fhip, but 
innocently bought her for their trade : and I am per- 
fuaded they will fo far believe me, as, at leafl, to zSl 
more cautioufly for the time to come. Well, faid I, and 
will yo* deliver one jnefFage to them from me ? Yes, 
I will fays he, if you will give it under your hand, in 
writing, that I may be able to prove it came from you, 
and not out of my own head. lanfvvered, that I would

reafon of it, and the unjuft cruel defign of it ; andcon*- 
cluded to the commanders that they had done what they 
not only fhould have been afhamed of, but alfo, that if 
ever they canxe to England, and I lived to fee them 
there, they fhould all pay dearly for it, if the laws of 
my country were not grown out o£ ufc before I arrived 
there. 

My old pilot read this over and over agaiji, and alked- 
xne feveral times, if I would ftand to it. I anfwered, I- 
would fland to it as long as I had any thing left in the • 
worlds being fenfiblethat I fhould, one- time or other,, 
find an opportunity to put it home to them. But 
we had nooccafion ever to let the pilot carry this let- 
ter ; for he never went back again. While thofe things 
were pafTmg between us, by way of difcourfe, we went 
forward diredlly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days 
fail, came to anchor at tiie fouth weft point of the 

freatgulph of Nanquin: wheKe, by the way, I came 
y accident to un^erftand, that the two Dutch Ihips 
were gene that, length before me, and that I fhould cer- 
tainly, fall into their hands. L confulted my partner 
again in this exigency, and he was as much at a lofs as 
I was, and would very gladly^have been fafe on fhore^ 
almoft any-wher e. However, I was not in fuch per- 
plexity neither, but I afked the old pilot if there was 
no creek or harbour,, which I might put into, and pur— 
fne my bufinefs with the Chinefe privately, and.be in no 
danger of the enemy ?. He told me, if 1 would fail to ' 
the fouthward about two and forty leagues^ there was a 
little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the 
milTion ufually landed from Macao, on their progrefs ta 
teach thechriftian religion to the Chinefe, and where na« 
European fhips ever put in ; and, . if I thought proper to 
put in there, I might coniider what farther courfe to take 
when I was oa fhore. He confefTed, he faid, it was not^ 
a place for merchants, except, that at fome cert&in times 
they had a kind of a i^ir there, wKen the merchants 
from Japan came over thither to buy the Chinefe mer- 
chandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this place i the name of 

port,, 35 he^ called it^. I may^ perhaps fpell wrong ; 

^ for 



k OB IKS ON cRirsoF. t6^ 

fbrl do not particularly remember it, having loft this, 
together with the names of many other' places fet down 
in a little pocket-book, which was i^^iled by the wat€r>^ 
on an accident which I ihall relate in its order : hMt this 
I remember, that the Chinefe pr japanefe merchants we 
correipond with,, call it by- a different name from that 
which our Portuguefe pilot gave it,^ and pronounced it 
as above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our refolutions to go to-this 
place, we weighed the next day, having only gone 
twice on ftiore,. where we were to get frefh water ; on both 
which occalions the people of the. country- were very 
civil to us, and brought us abundance of things to feil 
tons; I mean of proviiions, plants, roots, tea, rice, 
and fome fowls ; but nothing without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) 
not till £ve dajrs ; but it was wQry much to our iktisfad- 
tion ; and I was joyfuU and,, I may fay, thankful, when 
I fet my foot fafe on ftiore ;: refolying,. and my partner 
too, that if it was poffible to difpofe of ourfelves and 
effects any other way, though not every way to our fa- 
tisfadbion, we woidd never ftt one foot on board that un- 
happy veffel again; and indeed, 1 muft acknowledge^ 
that of all the circuraftances of life that ever I had any 
experience of, nothing makes mankind fo completely 
miferable as that of being in conilant fear. Well does 
the fcripture fay, * The fear of man brings a fnare ;* it 
is a life of death : and the mind is fo entirely fi^prefTed 
by it, that it is capable of no relief; the animal fpirits 
fink, and aU the vigour of nature,, which- ufually fup- 
ports men under other afHi6bions, and is prefect to them 
m the greateft exigencies, fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of its ufual operations upon the fancy, 
by heightening every danger ; reprefenting the Englifti 
and Dutch captains to be men uncapable of hearing rea- 
fon, or diflinguiftung between honeft men and rogues ; 
or between a ftory calculated for our own turn, made 
out of nothing, on purpofe to deceive, and a true ge- 
nuine account of our whole voyage,, progrefs, and de- 
fign ; for we might many ways have convinced any 
reafonable creature that we wer< not pirated: the

frankly fhewing ourfclvcs, and entering into ftich a,n<f 
fuch ports ; even our very manner, the force we had, 
the number of men > the few arms, little ammunition 
and fhort'provifions ; all thefeXvould have ferved to con- 
vince any man that we were no pirates. The opium, 
and other goods we had on board, would make it appear 
the fhip had been at Bengal? the Dutchman, who, it 
was faid, had the names of all the men that were in the 
fhip, might eafily fee that we were a mixture of Eng- 
lifh, Portuguefe, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen 
onboard. Thefc, and many other particular circum- 
flances, might have made it evident to the underflanding 
of any commander, whofe hands we might fall into, 
that we were no pirates. 

But fear, that bjind ufelefs paffion, worked another 
way, and threw us into the vapours ; it .bewildered our 
underftandings, and fet the imagination at work, to 
form a thoufand terribk things, that, perhaps, might 
never happen ;. we firfl fuppofed, as, indeed, every body 
had related to us, that the feamenon board the EngUflk. 
and Dutch fhips, but efpecially the Dutch, were fo en- 
raged at the liameofa pirate, and efpecially at our 
beating oiF their boats, and efcaping, that they would 
»ot give themfelves leave to enquire, whether we were 
pirates or no ; but would execute us pfF-hand, as we caU 
it, without giving U5 any * room for a defence. We re- 
fleded that there was really fo much apparent evidence 
before them, that they would fcarce enquire after any 
more ; as, lirft, that the fhip was certainly th« fame, 
and that fome of the feamen among them knew her, 
and had been on board her ; and fecondly, that when 
we had intelligence at the river Cambodia, that they 
were coming down to examine us, we fought their boats, 
and fled ; fo that we made no doubt but they were as 
fully fatisfied of our being pirates, as we were fatisfied ' 
of the contrary ; and I often faid, I knew not but I 
fhould have been apt to have taken the little circum- 
ftances for evidence, if the tabids were turned, and my 
cafe \vas theirs; and have made no fcruple of cutting 
all the crew to pieces, without believing, or, perhaps, 
confidermg, what they i^jiight have to offer in their 
""^^ence.

But let that be how it will, thofe were our appre- 
henfions ; and both my partner ^nd I too fcarce llept a 
night without dreaming of halters, and yard-arms ; 
that is to fay gibbets ; of fighting, and being taken ; 
of killing, and being killed; and one night I was ia 
fuch a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had 
boarded us, 'and I was knocking one of their feamen 
down, that I flruck my double fill againft the fide of 
the ca()in I lay in, with iuch a force as wounded my. 
hand moil grievoufly, broke my. knuckles, and cut and 
bruifed the flcfh : fo that it not only waked mc out of 
my deep, but I was once afraid! fhould have loH two of

' Another apprehenfioni had, was, of the cruel ufagt 
we ftiould meet with from them, if we fell into their 
Mnds'; then the flory of Amboyna came into my head« 
and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, as they 
did our countrymen there ; and make fome of our men, 
by extremity of torture, confefs thofe crimes they 
never were guilty of; own themfelves, and all of us, to 
be pirates ; and fo they would put tis to death, with a, 
formal appearance ofjullice; and that they might b« 
tempted to do this, for the gain of our fhip and cargo ; 
which was worth four or five thoufand pounds, put all 
together. 

Thefe things tormented me, and my partner too^ 
night and day ; nor did we confider that the captains of 
fhips have no authority to ad thus ; and if we had fur- 
rendered prifoners to them, they qould not anfwer the 
deilroying us or torturing us, but would be accountable 
for it when they came into their own country. This, I 
fay, gave me no fatisfadlion ; for, if they will aft thut 
with us, what advantage would it be to us that they ' 
would be called to an account for it : or, if we were 
fir ft to be murdered, what fatisfadion would it be to us 
to have them punifhed when they came home i 

X cannot refi^in taking notice here what refledioYis

was not in the leaft inclined to, much lefs guilty of ; and 
in a place and circumftance, where innocence was net 
like to be any protedlion at all to me. 

After thefe thoughts, fomething of religion would, 
come in ; and I would be coniidering that this feemed 
to me to be a difpoiition of immediate providence ; and 
I ought to look upon it, and lubmit to it, as fuch ; that

But how much the greater weight the anxities and 
perplexities of thofe things were to our thoughts while 
we were at fea, by fo much the greater was our fatis» 
faftion, when we faw ourfelves on ftiore t and my part- 
ner told me, he dreamed, that he had a very heavy 
load upon his back, which he was to carry up an hill, 
and found that he was not able to ftand long under it : 
but the Portuguefe pilot came, and took it off his back, 
and the hill difappeared, the ground before him fhewing 
all fmooth and plain : And truly it was fo ; we were all 
like men who had a load taken off their backs. 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my 
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear ; and, as 
I faid above, we refolved to go no more to fea in that 
(hip. When we came on fhore, the oldpilotj whowaa 
now our friend, got us a lodging, and a warehoufe for/ 
our goods, which, by the way, was much the fame : 
it was a little houfe or hut, with a large houfe joining to 
it, all built with canes, and palifadoed round with large 
canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which it feems 
there were not a few in the country. However, the 
magillrates allowed us all a little guard, and we had 
a ioldier with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, wjio 
Hood centinel at our door ; to whom we allowed a pint 
of rice, and a little piece of money, about the value of 
threepence per day, fo that our goods were kept very 
fafe. 

The fair or mart, iifually kept in this place, had been 
over fome time ; however, we found that there were 
three or four junks in the river, and two Japanners, I 
mean, ihips from Japan, with goods which they had 
bought in China, and were not gone away, having Ja- 
panefe merchants on fhore. 

The firft thing our old Portuguefe pilot did for us, was 
to bring us acquainted with three miflionary Roi^^Ai 
priefts, who were in the town, and who had been thefe

country again ; though 1 had not the leaft view of the 
xftanner ; and when I began fometimes to think of it, 
could not imagine by what method it was to be done. 
Providence, I fay, began here to clear up our way a 
little ; and the iirfl thing that offered «va6, that our old 
Portuguefe pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who 
began to enquire what goods we had ; and, in the firft 
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very 
good price for it, paying us in gold by weight, fome in 
Snail pieces of their own coin, and fome in fmall wedges, 
of about ten Or eleven ounces each. While wc were 
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my head, 
that h^ might perhaps, deal with us for the fliip too ; 
and I ordered the interpreter lo propofe it to him. He 
flirunk up hi^ fhoulders at it, when at firll propofed 
to him ; but in a few days after, he came to me, with 
one of the miflionary priefts for his interpreter, and 
told me, he had a propofal to make to me, and that was 
this : He had bought a great quantity of goods of us 
when he had no thoughts (or propofals made to him) 
of buying the fhip ; and that therefore, he had not 
money enough to pay for thefhip ; but if I would let the 
fame men who were in the fhip navigate her, he would 
hire the fhip to go to Japan ; and would fend them 
from thence to the Phillippine iflands with another 
loading, which he would pay the freight of, before 
they went from Japan ; and thati at their return, he 
would buy the ftiip. I begah to liften to this propofal, 
And fo eager did my hea<A run upon rambling, that 
I could not but begin to entertain a notion myfelf of 
going \\'ith him, and fo to fail from the Phillippine iflands 
away to the South Seas ; and accordingly I afked the 
Japanefe merchant, if he would not hire us to the 
Pmllippine iflands, and difcharge us there. He faid, no 
he could not do that ; for then he could not have the re- 
turn of his cargo ; but he would diicharge us in Japan, 
he faid, at theftiip's return. Well, ftill I \vas for taking 
him at that propofal, and going myfelf ; but my partner,

-the Spaniards at the Philippines ; more falfc, more cruel, 
.more treacherous, than they. ^ 

But to bring thh' long turn of our affairs to aconclu- 
fion ; the firft thing we had to do, was to confult 
with the captain of the (hip, and with the men, and 
fenow if they were willing to go to Japan ; and, while 
1 was doing this, the young man, whom, as 1 faid, my 
^nephew had left with me as my companion ifor m.y 
travels> came to me and told me, that he thoqght that 
voyage promifed very fair, and that there was a great 
profpeft of advantage, and iie would he <very glad if I 
undertook it ; but that if I would not^and would give 
liim leave, he would go as avmerchant,r4or how I |jeaiie^ 
to order him ; that if ever he came to England^|[^^^?v 
was there, and alTve, he would render mea fattld^u:^' 
?count of his fuccefs, and it ihould .be as niucii^h^k^ I 
^pleafed. ^ ^ , 

I wais really loth tbpart with^him ;'^but, confidering 

«the profpeft of advantage, which was really confiderable, 

and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well iit 

dt as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; but firft I 

told him I would confult my partner, *and give him an 

-anfwer the next day. My partner and I difcourfed 

about it; andmy partner made a moil generous offer : 

he told me, you kno^v it has been an unlucky (htp, and 

twc both refolve- not to go t6 fea in it again, if your 

vfteward (fo he palled my man) will venture the voyage, 

I'll leavemy fhare of the vefTel to him, and let him, 

imake the beft of it ; and if we live to meet in England, 

and he meets with fuccefs abroad; he fhall account for 

one half of the profits of the (hip's freight to us, the 

totherlhall be his own. ^ ^ 

H my partner, who was no way concerned with my 
•young man, made iiim fuch an oifer, 1 could do no 
lefs than offer him the fame ; and all the ,fhip's com- 
^pany being willing to go with him, we made over half 
the (hip to him in property, and took a writing from 
him, obliging him to account for the other ; and away 
he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very 
.punftual honed man to him, proteded him at Japan, 
and got him a licence to come on ihore, which the

Europeans in general have not lately obtained ^paidkim 
his freight very pundtually, fent liim to the Phillippines, 
loaded with Japan and China wares^ and a fupercargo 
of their own. Who trafficking with the Spaniards, brought 
back European goods again, and a great quantity of 
cloves and other fpice ; and there he was not only paid 
))i»- freight very well, and at a very good price, but 
being not willing to fell the (hip theh, the merchant fur- 
niihed him with goods on his own account ; that, for 
' me money, and fome fpices of his own, which he 

oueht with him, he went back to the Manillas, to die 
Spaniards, where he fold his cargo very well. Here, 
having gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got 
his fhip made a free fhip ; and the governor of 'Manilla 
hired him to go to Aca^ulco in America, on the coafl of 
Mexico; and give him a licence to land there, and 
travel to Mexico ; and to pafs in any Spanifh fhip ta 
Europe, with all his men. 

He made' the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and 
there he fold his fhip ; and having there alfo obtained 
allowjjKe to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found 
means, fome how or other, to go to* Jamaica with all 
his treafure; and about eight years after came to Eng-

though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues 
too, for, as they believed the ftory of our being

them very well ; then I made the Englifhman gun-

It is very obfervable, that we wonder at the gran-*

having firll a notion of t^« barbarity of thofe coun*

Othcrwife, what are their buildings to the palaces

city of London has more trade, than all their mighty 
fempire. One Englilh, or Dutch, or French man of

uncertain in going off; they have |)0wder, but it is of 
no ftrength ; they have neither dilcipline in the ^Id^

me when I came home, and heard our people fay fuch 
iine things of the power, riches, glory, magnificence, 
and trade of the Chinefe, becaufe I faw and Knew that 
they were a 'contemptible herd or croud of ignorant

not its difbince inconceivably great from Mufcovy, and 
were not the Mufcovite empire almoft as rude, impotent, 
and ill-governed a croud of (laves as they, the czar of 
Mufcovy might, with mncheafe, drive them all out of 
their country, and conquer them in one campaign ; 
and had the czar, who I fince hear is a growing prince, 
and begins to appear formidable in the world, fallen 
this way, inftead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in

envied or interrupted him ; he might, by this time, have 
been Emperor of China, inflead of being beaten by the 
king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one

is imperfedl and impotent, compared to the fame things 
in Europe ; alfo, in their knowledge, their learning,

provifions for them, and all theijr attendants. That 

which I particularly obfoved, «l^ xo out travelling

with his baggage, was this ; that though wc received 
fufficient proyiiions, both for ourfelvcs and oar horfes^ 
from the counfry', as belonging to the mgiidarin, yet 
we were obliged to pay for every thing we ' had after 
the market-price of the country, and the mandarin's 
flew.ard, or commiflkry of the proviiions, coJleded it 
duly from us, fo that our travelling in the retinue of 
the mandarin;^ though it was a very great kindnefs to- 
us, was not fuch' a mighty favour in him, but was, 
indeed, a great advantage to him, confidering there 
were about thirty other people travelling in the fame 
manner befides us, under the protedion of his retimje, 
or, as we may call it, under his convoy. This, I fa(y> 
was a great advantage to him, for his country fiirniflied 
all the proviiions for nothing, and he took all ourmonpy 
for them. 

We were Rve and twenty days travelling ta Pekin> 
through a country infinitely populous, but miferably 
cultivated, the hulbandry, economy, and the way of 
Ifving, all very miferable, though theyboaft fo much

fo it is, if we, who underftand how to live, were to' 
endure it, or to compare i^'with our own, but not fo to 
thefe poor wretches, wha know no other. The pride 
of thefe people is infinitely great, and exceeded by 
nothii\^ but their poverty, which adds to that whicti

occafion to remember, and which not taking doe care 
of, th« leaves rotted, and the words were never after 
to be read, to my great lofs, as to the names of fomc 
places which I touched at in this voyage. 

At length wc arrived at Pekin ; I had nobody with 
me-but the youth, whom my nephew the captain had 
given roe to attend me as a fervant, and who proved 
very trufty and diligent ; and my partner had nobody 
with him but one fervant, who was a kinfmam Asfcr 
the Portuguefe Pilot, he being defirous to fee the court, 
wc gave hir« his paflage, that is to fay, bore his charges 
for his company ; and to ufe him as an interpreter, for 
he underitood the language of the country ,^ and fpoke _ 
good French, and a little Englifh ; and, indeed, this old 
man \^as a moft ufeful implement to us every vhere ; 
fcr we. had not been above a week at Pekiri, when he 
c:;me laughing ; Ah, Seignior Ingleie, laid he, I have 
iomeihing to tell you, wiJI^nakeyGur heart glad. My 
heart glad ! fa'd I ; what can that be ? 1 don*t knew 
:^ny thing in this country can either give me joy or 
gvief, to any great degree. Yes, yes, faid the eld man, 
in broken Englifh, make you glad, me forrow ; forry 
he i^uld have faid. This made me more inquifitive. 
Why,faid I, will it make ycu lorry ? Becaufe, faid he, - 
you hav-^ brought me here twenty-Eve days journey,

leave hiip behind to go back all alone. I confefs^ I 
was furprifed with this news : a fecret joy fpread itfelf 
over my whole fou], whicl\ I cannot defcribe, and n^ve.r 
felt before or iwce ; and I had no power, for a good 
while, to fpeak a word to the old man : but at lafl I . 
turned to him : How do you know this ? faid I : are 
you fure it is true ? Yes, faid he, Imet this morning, in 
the fireet, an old acquaintjince of mine, an Arracniatr, . 
or one you call a Grecian, who is among them ; he came 
lafl from Ailracan, and wasdefigning tog© to Tonquia 
where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, 
and is now refolved to go back with the caravan t%- 
Mufcow, and fo down the river of Wolga to Ailracan. 
Well, Seignior, {aid I, do not be uneafy about being 
left to go Back alone : if this be a method for my re-* 
turn to En£;land, it fhall be your fault if you go back 
to Macao at all. We then went to confulting together 
what was to be done, and alked my pirtner what he . 
thought of the piloi's news, and whether it wculdfuit 
with his affairs ? He told me he would do juft as I would 
for he had fettled all his affairs fo well at Bengal, and 
left his eifedls in fuch good hands, that as we made a 
good voyage here, if he could veft it in China filks, 
wrought and raw, fuch as might be worth the carriage, 
he would be content to go to England, and then make 
his voyage back to Bengal by the company's (hips. 

Having refolved upon this, we agreed, that if our , 
Portugucfe pilo;t would go with us, we would bear his 
charges to Mufcow, or to England, if he pleafed ; nor, , 
indeed, were we to be eflecmed over generous in that 
part neither, if we bad not rewarded him farther ; for 
the fervice he had done us was really wOrth all that, 
and more ; for he had not only been a pilot to us at 
fea, but he had been alfo like a broker .for us otx 
fiiore : and his procuring for us the Japan merchant, wai 
fbme hundred of pounds in our pockets. So we confult- 
ed together about it : and, being willing to gradfy him, 
which was, indeed, but doing him juflice, and very 
filing alfo to have him with us befid^, for he was a 
tnoH neceflary man on all occa(io^$, we agreed to 
giye him a quantity of coined gold, whidi an I cooa-

and to bear his charges, both for himfelf and horfe, 
except only a horfe to carry his goods. 

Having fettled this among onrfeivesy we called him> 
to let him know what we had refolved ; 1 told him, he 
had complained of our being like to let him go back 
alox^, aad I was now to tell him we were refolved he 
fhould not go back at all : that as we had refolved to 
CO to Europe with the caravan, we refolved alfo he 
flionld go with us, and that we called him to know his 
nund. He ihook his head, and *(idd it was a long 
jolirney, and he had no pecune to carry him thither,

him, we believed it was (b, and therefore we had re- 
folved to do fomething for him, that (hoald let him 
fee how fenlible we were of the fervice he had done 
US ; and alfo how agreeable he was to us : and then I 
told him what we had reiblved to give him here, ivhich 
he might lay out as we would do our own ; and chat as 
for his charges, if he would' go with us, we would 
let him fafe afhore, (life and cafualttes excepted) 
either in Mufcovy, or in England, which he would, 
at our own charge, except only the carriage of hit 
goods. 

He received the propofal like a man tranfported, and 
told us, he would go with us over the whole world ; 
andfo, inlhort, we all prepared ourfelvesfor thejour- 
|iey. However, as it was with us, fo it was with 
the other merchants, they had many things to do ;. 
and inflead of being ready in five weeka, it was four 
months and fome ood days before all ^ings were got 
together. - ^ ^ 

It was the beginning of February, our ftyle, when we

men and merchants ; that is to fay, all the paflengers^ 
except the fervants, to a great council, as they termed 
it. At this great council, every one depofited a certain 
<;^uantity of money to a common flock, for the necef- 
fary expeivce of buying forage on the way, where it 
was not otherwife to be had, and for fatisf/ing the 
guides, getting horfes, and the like. And here they 
conftituted the journey, as they called it, viz. They 
named captains and oiEcera to draw us ail up^ and give 
the command in cafe of an attack, and gave every one 
.their turn of command. Nor was this forming us into

t%% ADVENTURES OF 

The road all on thb fide of the country is very po- 
puloQS, and is full of j)otters« andeardi-makers, that 
IS to fay* people chat tempered the earth for the China 
ware ; and, as I was going along, oar Portnguefe ^i- 
lot, who' had always (bmething or other to fay to niak& 
OS merry, camefneering tome, and toldme, he would 
fhew the greateft nuity in all the country ; and that 
I ihould have this to fay of China, after all the ill-hu- 
moured things I had faid of it, that I had feen one thing 
which was not to be feen in all the world befide. I was 
very importunate to know what it was ; at lafl he told 
roe» it was a gentleman's houfe, built all with Chinn 
ware. Well, faid I, arc not the material of their 
building the produdl of their own country ; and fo' it it 
ail China ware, it is not ? No, no, fays he, I mean» 
it is a houfe all made of China ware. Inch as y«u call 
fo in England : or, as it is called in our country, por- 
celain. Well, faid I, fuch a thing may be ; How 
big is it : Can we carry it in a box upon a camel ? If 
we can, we will buy it. Upon a camel I faid the old 
pilot, holding up both his hands, why there is a family 
of thirty people lives in it. 

' I was then curious, indeed, to fee it t and when I came 
to it, it«was nothing but this : it was a timber houie» 
or a houfe built, as we call it in England, with lath 
and plaifler, but all the plaiftering was really China 
w^re, that is to fay, it was plaiitered with the earth that 
makes China ware. 

The outfide, which the fun fhone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfeftly white, and paint- 
ed with blue figures, as the. large China ware in England 
is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. As to> 
die iniide, all the walls, inftead of wainfcot, were lined 
up with hardened and painted tiles. Tike the little fquare 
tiles we call gaily utiles in England, all made of the 
fineft China, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, 
with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold* 
many tiles making but one figure, but joined fo artifi- 
cially with mortar beinfi; made of the fauje earth, that 
it was very hard to ree where the tiles met. The' 
Aoors of the room* were of the fame compofition> 
and as hard as the earthen floors we have in ufe in 

fev^ral 



ROBINSON CRUSOE* 2»| 

fcveral parts of England, cfpecially Lincolnfhire, Not- 
tinghamfhire, Leicerterftiire, &c. as hard as (lone, and 
fmooth, but not burnt and painted, except (biiie fiAaller 
rooms like clofetar, which were all as it were paved 
with the fame tile ; the cielings, and in a word, all the' 
plaiilering-work in the whole houfe, were of the fame 
earth ; and, after all, the roof was cosrered with tiles 
x)f the fame, but of a deep (hining black. 

This was a China warehoufe indeed, truly and lite* ' 
rally to be called fo ; and, had I not been upon the 
journey, I could have flayed fome days to fee and ct* 
amine the particulars of it. They told me there were ■. 
fountains and fi(h-poBds in the garden, all paved at the 
bottom and iides with the fame, and fine llatues f^x. up 
in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain 
earthi^ and buriit whole. 

As this is one of the firtgularities of China, fo they 
«ay be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very fure they 
excel in their accounts of it; for they told. me fuch 
incredible things of their performance in crockery • 
ware, for fuch it i^, that Icare not to relate, as know- • 
ing it could not be true ; one told me, in particular, ©f 
a workman that made a'^ fhip, with allits tackle,* 
and mails, and fa3s, in earthen ware, big fnough to 
carry Hfiy men. If he had told me he launched it, ahd 
made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have faid form^ :' 
thing to it indeed ; but as it was, I knew the wholes 
(lory, which was, in fhort, aiking pardon for the word, - 
that the fellow lied ; fa I fraikd, and faid nothing to 
it. ^ 

This odd fight kept me twa hour* behind the caravan , 
for which the leader of it for the day fined- me about' 
the value of three fhillings ; and told roe, if it had 
been three days journey without the wall, as it wa» 
three days within, he mud have fined me four timed as' 
much, and made me afk pardon the next council 
day, fo I promifcd^to be more orderly ; for, indeed, 
I found afterwards the orders made for keeping all 
together were abfolutely neccfTary for our common 
fafefy. 

In two days more we paffed the great China wall, 
made for a fortification againft the Tartaiis ; andaverv

great work it is, going over hilh and mountains in an 
endleis track* wkere the rocks are impaifable, and the 
precipices fiich as no enemy could pcfiibly enter,, or, 
indeed, climb |}p, or where, if they did, -no waif could 
hinder them. They tell us, itrlengthis near a thou- 
fand Engfiih miles, but that the country U £ve hun- 
dred in a ftrait meafured line, which the wall bounds, 
without meafuring the windings and turnings it takes ; 
'tis about four fathom high, and as many thick in feme 
places. % 

I flood (Hll an hour, or thereabouts, without tref- 
pafliDg on our orders, for fo loi^|^ the caravan was in 
paffing the gate ; I fa} , I flood &m an hour to look at 
V on every fide, near, and far off, I mean, what was 
within my view ; and the guide of om; caravan, who 
had been extdling it for the wonder of the y^rld^^ 
was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told 
him it was a moil excellent thii^g to keep off* the Tar-^ 
tars, which he happened not to underfland as I meant 
it, and fo took ic for a compliment ; but the old pilot 
laughed; Q Seignior In^lefe, faid he you fpeak in co- 
lours* In colours I faid I : what do you piean by . 
that ? Why you fpeak what looks white this way, and 
black that way ; gay one way, and dull another way ; 
yott tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; 
ycm tell me by that, it is good for nothing but to ke^p 
OBt Tartars ; or, it will keep out none but Tartars : I 
underfland you. Seignior Inglefe, I underfland you, faid 
he, joking ; but Seignior Chiaefe underfland you his 
own way. . 

WelU faid I, Seignior, do you think it would fland 
imi an army of our country people, with a good train 
of artillery ; or our engineers, with two compa- 
nies of minerii ? Would they not batter it down in ten 
days, that an army might enter in battalia, or blow 
if up into the air, foundaucn and all, that there Ihould 
be no fign of it left ? Ay 9 ay^ faid hcj^ 1 know that.

of ^he way, and we heard no more of lib fine ftonjjr of * 
the Chinefc power and greatnefs^ while he ftaycd. 

After we had pafled this mighty Nothing, called a 
wall, fomething like the pidls wall, fo famous in Nor- 
thumberland, and built by the Romans, we began tio 
find the country thinly inhabited, and the people rather 
confined to live in forti^ed towns and cities, as being 
rubje(fl to the inroads and depredations of the Tartars, 
who rob in great armies, and therefore are hot to be re- 
filled by the naked inhabitants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the nccefiity of keeping to- 
gether in a caraven, a^ we travelled ; for we faw feveral 
troops of Tartars roving about ; but when 1 came to fee 
them dilUndly, I wondered how that the Chinefic em- 
pire could be conquered by fuch contemptible fellows ; 
for they are a mere herd or croud of wild fellows, keep- 
ing no order, and Underftanding no difcipline, or man* 
ner of fight. 

Their horfes are poor, lean, ftarved creatures, taught 
nothing, and are fit for nothing ; and this we found 
.the firft day we faw them, which was after we entered 
the wilder part of the country ; our leader for the day 
gave leave for about fixteen of us to go a hunting as 
they call it : and what was this but hunting of fheep i 
However, it may be called hunting too ; for the crea- 
tures are the wildell, and fwifteft of foot, that ever I 
faw of their kind ; only they will not run a great way, 
and you are fure of fport when you begin the chace; 
for they appear generally by thirty or forty in a flock, 
and, like true fheep, always keep together when they 
fly. 

In purfuit of 'this odd fort of game, it was our hap 
to meet with about forty Tartars ; whether they were 
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked 
for another kind of prey, I know not ; but as foon as 
they faw us, one of them blew a kind of horn veiy 
loud, but with a barbarous found that I had never 
heard before ; and, by the way, never care to hear 
again. We all fuppofed ^his was to call their friends

appeared at about a^mile difUnce, but our work wa» 
over Rr&, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Mufcow happened to 
be amon^il us : and as ibon as he heard the horn^ he . 
told us, in ihort, that we had nothing to do. but to 
charge them immediately, without lois of time ; and, 
drawing us up in a line, he afked, if we were refolved ; ] 
We told him. We were ready to follow him : fo he 
rode diredly up to them. They flood gazing at us like . 
a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor (hewing the 
face of any oider at all ; but as foon as they faw us ad- ' 
vance, they let fly their arrows: which, however, mif- 
fed us verv happUy; it feems they miftook not their 
aim, btt^ their £ftance : for their arrows aU fell a little 
fhort ot us, but with fo true an aim, that had we been 
about 20 yards nearer, we mufl: have had fever^l men 
wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted : and though it was at a 
great dillance, we fired, and fent thenv leaden bullets 
for wooden arrows^ following our (hot full gallop, 
refolving to fall in among them fword in hand : for 
fo our bold Scot that led us diredled. He was, indeed, 
but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and 
bravery on this occaflon, and yet with fuch a ccol 
courage, too, that I never faw any man in a<5lion fitoer 
for command. As foon, as we came up to them, we^ 
fired our piilols in their faces, and then drew ; bur^ 
they fled in thegreateft confufion imaginable : the only 
ftand any of them -made was on our right, where 
three of thepa ftood, and, by figns, called the reft to 
come back to them, having a kind of fey mi tar in 
their hands, and their bow^i hanging at their backs. ' 
Our brave commander, without afking any body to 
foHow him, galUiped up clofe to them, and with his 
fufil knocked one of them off bis horfe, killed the 
feoohd with his piflrol, and the third ran away : and thus 
ended our fight ; but we had this misfortune attending 
it, vi2« that all our mutton that we had in chace , 
got away^ We had not a man killed or hurt ; but, as 
R>r tht Tartars, there were about five of them killed : ' 
ift^jf xnan/fvere woanded, we knew not: but this we 



ROilNSON ^RUSOI. S3$ 

knew, that the other party was fo frighted with the noifi 
of our guns, that they fled, and never made any at* 
tempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinefe dominions, an J 
therefore the Tartars were not fo bold a^s afterwards^ 
but in about five days we entered a vafl great wild de- 
fert, which held us three days and nights march ^ and 
we were obliged to carry our water with us in great 
leather bottles, and to encamp all night, juft as I havQ 
heard they do in the deferts of Arabia. 

J aiked our guides, whofe dominion this was ki ? 
and they told me, this was a kind of border that 
might be called No Man's Land; being part of the 
Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary ; but that how- 
ever, it was reckoned to China ; that there was no care 
taken here to preferve it from tlie inroads of thieves % 
and therefore it was reckoned the worft defert in the 
whole march, though we were to go over fome mucl^ 
larger. 

In paffing this wildernefs, which, I confefs, was at 
the firft view very frightful to me, we faw two or three 
' times little parties of the Tartars, but they feemed to be 
upon their own affairs, and to have no deiign upon us ; 
andfo, like the man who met the devil, if they had 
ijoWing to fay to us, we had nothing to iay to them ; w* 
let them go. 

Once, iiowever, a party of tlicm came fo near as to 
(land andjgaze at us ; whether it was to coniider what 
' tSey fhould do, viz. to attack *^us, or not attack us, 
we knew not ; but when we were pafled at fome dif- 
tance by them, we made a rear-gqard of forty men, 
and ftood ready for them, letting the caravan pafs half 
a mile, or thereabout?, before us ; after awhile they 
marcned off, only we found they aflaulted us with five 
arrows at their parting ; one of which wounded a horfe» 
ib that it difabled him ; and we left him the next dky, 
poor creature, in great need of a good farrier ; we fup- 
pofe they might fhoot more arrows, which might fall 
ihort of us ; but, v^ faw no more arrows, or Tartars, at

a^arn. « 

I jumped up upon my feet inflailtly, and got hold of 
my iwori, but no enemies in view. I found a Tartar 
lie dead/ and his horfe ftanding very quietly by him ;, 
and, looking farther, I faw my champion and deliverer, 
who had been to fee what the Chinele had done, com-. 
ing back with his hanger in his hand; the old man, 
feeing me on my feet, came running to me, and cm- 
braced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before 
that I had been killed ; and feeing me bloody, would 
fee how I was hurt ; but it was not much, only what we 
call a broken head ; neither did I afterwaids find any 
great inconvenience from the blow other than the place 
Which was hurt, and which was well again in t>vo or 
tiiree days. 

We made no great gain^ however, by this viftory ; 
for we loll a camel, and gained a horfe ; but that which 
was remarkable, when we came back to the villagey 
the man demanded to be paid for the camel : I difputed 
it, and it was brought to a hearing before the Chr- 
nefe Judge of the place : that is to iay, in Englifh, we 
went before a juftice of the peace. Give him his 
due, he aftedwith a great deal of prudence and impar- 
tiality^and, having heard both fides, he gravely aiked 
the Chinefe man that went with me to buy the camel, 
whofe fervant he was ? I am no fervant, faid he, but 
went with the ftranger. At whofe requell ? faid the 
juftice. At the ftranger- s requeft, faid he. Why then 
faid the juftice, you were the Granger's fervant for 
tM time ; and the camel being delivered to his 
mvant, wit as delivered to him, and he muft pay foi: 
it. 

T confefs the thing was fo clear, that I had not a word 
to fay : but admiring to fee fuch juft reafOning upon the' 
^X)nfeqoence, and fo accurate ftating the cafe, 1 paid 
willingly for the <;amel, and fent for another : but you 
may obferve, Lfent for it : I did not go to fetch it my- 
felfany more-: I had enough of that. 

The city of Naumis a frontier of the Chiiiefe em- 
pire : they call it fortified, and fo it is, as' fortifications 
go there : for this I will venture to affirm, that all the 

Tartars 



ROBINSON CRUSO^x %^%, 

"Tartars in Karakathay, which J believe^ arc foinc mil- 
iions> could not batter down the walls with their bows 
and arrows; but to call it (b-ong, if it were attacked 
with cannon, would be to make thofe who {inderibind i€ 
laugh at you. 

We wanted, al I have faid, about two days journey 
of this city, when meffengers were fent exprefs to every 
partof the road, to tell dl travellers and caravans to 
halt, till they had a guard fent to them; for that an 
unufual body of Tartars, making ten thouiand in all, 
had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the 
city. 

This was y^ bad news to travellers : however, it 

was carefully done of the governor, and we were very 

^lad to hear we fhoul4 have a gu^rd. Accordingly 

' two days after, we had 200 ibidicrs fent us froni a gar- 

: rifon of the Chinefe on our )eit, asd three hondred more 

from the city of Naum, and with thofe wie adv2^lced 

boldly : the three hundred (blcBers from Naum marched 

. in oCir front, the two hundred in otir rear* and our men 

on each fide of our camels with omr baggage* and the 

whole jcaravan in the center; in this order, and well 

pr(^pared for battle, we thought ourfelves a match for 

the whole ten thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they had ap« 

^ peared ; but the next day, when they did appear, it 

w^s ^uite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when marching from a 
little well-fituated town, called Changu, wehadarivei^ 
to pafs, where we were obliged to ferry ; and had 
the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the 
time to have attacked us, when, the caravan being over» 
the rear guard was behind ; but they did not appear 
Iherc. 

About three hours after, when we were entered upon 

\ a defert of about 15 or 16 miles oyer, behold, by a cloud 

. of duft they raifed, we faw an enemy wa^ at hand ; and 

they were at hand indeed, for they came on upon the 

ipur. 

The Chinefe, our guard on the front, who had talked 
fo big the day before, began to ibgger, and the foldiers 
frequently looked behind them ; which iis a certain fign 
in a foldier, that he is juft ready to run away. My 



•SY ADVENTURES . Of 






old pilot was orittymind ;^ anl- Jb»iii% near me, he 
called out, Scigniorln^fTe/Yaidhe, thpfe fellows muft 
be encouraged, or they will ruin us all ; for if the Tar* 
tars come on, they will never ibnd it. I am of your 
mind, faid 1 : but what courfe mufl be done ? Done, 
faid he, let fifty of our men advance, and Hank them on 
each wing, and encourage them, and they will fight 
like brave fellows in brave company ; but without it 
they will every man turn his back. Immediately 1 rode 
up to our leader, and told him, who was exactly of our 
mind ; and accordingly fifty of us marched to Uie right 
iving, and fifty to th«: left, and the red made a line of 
referve , for (o we marched, leaving the laA two hun- 
dred men to make another body to themfelves, and to | 
^uard the 6amels ; only that, if need were, they ihould I 

»nd an hundred men to affift the lad fifty. j 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable j 
company they were ; how many, we could not tcil, but 
ten thoufand we thought was the leafl. .A party of \ 
them came dn firft, ind viewed our poflure, traverfing | 
the grodnd in the front of our line ; and as we found 
them within gun-lhot^ our leader ordered the two wings 
to advance fwiftly, and give them a falvo on each-wing 
with th/sir (hot, which was done ; but they went off, 
and I){uppofe went back to give an account of the re* 
cepti^n the^ were like to meet with ; and, indeed, that 
dilute clogged their llomachs ; for they imme^tdy 
halted} flood awhile to coniider of it, and, wheeling off 
to th^I^r, they gave over the deiign, and faid no m(M*ft 
to us lor that time, which was very agreeable to our 
circumftances, which were but very indifferent for a 
battle with fuch a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naum, or. 
Naunm ; we thankei the governor for his care for us, 
and colledled to the value of loo crowns, or there- 
abouts, which we gave to the foldiers fent to guard us : 
and here we refted one day. This is a garrifon indeod^ 
and there were nine hundred foldiers kept here ; bat the 
reafon of it was, that formerly the Mufcovite frontiers 
lay nearer to them than they do now, the Mufcovites iav- 
ing abandoned that part of the country (which lies from 
the city weft, for about two hundred adles) as defolate

^md nufit for vfif^ixf^d iB(M*e efp^cially* being fo very 
remote, and fo difficult to fend - troops hither for itsde- 
^fence ; for we had yet above two thoofand miles to Mii^ , 
covy, properly fo called. 

After diisf'we paffed feveral great rivers, aad two 
ib*eadful deferts, one of which we were iixteen days paf- 
/ingover* and which, as I faid, was to be called No 
Man's land ; and on the the 1 5th of April, we came to 
frontiers of the Mufcovite dominions. I think the £rft 
city, or town, or fortrefs, whatever it might be called, 
that belonged to the Czar of Mufcovy, was called Ar^ 
gun, being on the weft fide of the river Argun. 

I could not but difcover an infinite fatis&^on, that I 
was now arrived in, as I called it a chriftian coontry*; 
or, at leaft, in a country governed by. chriftians ; for 
though the Mufcovites do, in my opinion, but jaftde- 
ferve the name of chriftians ; yet iich they pretend to 
be, and are very devout in their way. . It would cer^ 
tainly occur to any man who travels the world as I have 
done, and who had any power of refiedion ; I iky, it 
would occur to him to refiedl, what a blefling it is to 
be brought into the world where the name of God, 
and of a Redeemer, is known, worftiipped, and adored, 
and not where the people, given up by heaven to 
flrong delufions, worfhip the devil, and proftrate diem«» 
ielves to flocks and ftones ; worfhip monfters, elemoUs* 
borrible fhaped animals, and ftatues, or imager of

' river running due ealt, in the latitude of 60 degrees, 
carries a vail concourfe of rivers :dong with it, and finds 
an ocean to empty itfelf in that latitude ; fo we are fare 
of fea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are ie-> 
veral confiderable rivers, whofe ftreams run as due north 

* as the Yamonr runs eaft ; and thefe are all found to join 
their waters with the great rivers Tartarus, named fo

The rivers running dl northward, as well as all the 
other rivers I am yet to (peak of, make it evident, 
chat the northern ocean bounds the land alfo on that

but of this I (hall fay no more ; it was my obfervation 
at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this 
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by 
eafy and moderate journies, and were very viiibly 
obliged to the care the czar of Mufcovy has taken, to 
have cities and towns built in as many places as are

foniething like the flationary foldiers placed by the Ro^

which I had read were particularly placed in Britsun fOr' 
the fccurity of commerce, and for the lodging of tra- 
vellers ; and thus it was here ; for wherever we came, 
though at thefe towns and flations the garrifons and 
governor were Ruffians, and profeifed mere pagans, fa- 
crificing to idols, and worfhipping the fun, moon, and

a village, near the laftof thofe places, I had the curl- 
ofity to go and fee their way of living ; which is mod 
brutifh and unfufterable ; they had, I fuppofe, a great 
facrifice that day ; for there Hood out upon an old Hump 
of a tree 4 an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil ; 
at leail as any thing we can thmk of to reprefent the 
devil can be made ; it had an head certainly not fo 
much refembling any creature that the world ever faw ; 
ears as big as goats horns, and as high ; eyes as big as 
a crown piece ; a nofe like a crooked rafn's horn, and 
a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion, 
with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under bill ; 
it was drefTed up in the filthiefl manner that you can 
fuppofe ; its upper garment was of (heep-fkins, with the 
wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with 
two horns growing through it : it was about eight feet 
high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other proportion 
of parts. 

This fcarecrow was fet up at the out-fide of th^ vil- 
lage ; and when 1 came near to it, there were iixteen 
or feventeen creatures, whether men or women I 
could not tell, for they make no diftindion by their 
habits, either of body or head ; thefe lay all flat on the 
ground, round this formidable block of ihapelefs wood. 
I faw no motion among them any more than if they 
had been logs of wood like their idol ; at lirft I really 
thought they had been fo ;^j3ut when I came a little 
nearer, they flarted up upon their feet ; and raifed an 
howling cry, as if it had been fo many deep-mouthed 
hounds, and walked away as if they were difpleafed at 
our difturbing them. A little way oiF from this mon- 
ilcr, and at the door of a tent or hut, made all of

I thought they were fuch ; for when I came nearer to

brought the offering, and were making their prayers to

this brutifh worfliip of an hobgoblin, than ever I wa» 
at any thing in my life ; to fee God's moft glorious 
and bcfl creature, to whom he Had granted fo many

that foul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted 
both to honour his maker, and be honoured by him ; 
I fay, to fee it funk and degenerated to a degree fo 
more than ft upid, astoproftrate itfelf to a frightful no- 
thing, a mere imaginary objedl, drefted up by them- 
felves, and made terrible to themfelves by their own 
contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; and 
that this fhould be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought 
up in hellifli devotion by the devil himfelf ; who, en- 
vying his Maker the homage and adoration of his 
creatures, had deluded them into fuchgrofs, fnrfeiting, 
fordid, and brutiih things, a» one would . think fhould

But what fignified all the aftonifhment and refleflion 
of thoughts ? Thus it was, and I faw it before my 
eyes ; and there was no room to wonder at it, or think 
k impoffible ; all my admiration turned to rage ; ar-d 
I rode up to the image or liionfter, call it what yoa 
will, and with my fword cut the bonnet that was on 
its head in two in the middle, fo that it hung down by

ibme leifure here, to put my defign in execution. I 
communicated my projedl to the Scots merchant of 
Mofcow, of whofe courage I had a fufficient tefHmony, 
as above. I told him what I had feen, and with what 
. iadignation I had fmce thought, that human nature 
c^uld be fo degenerate. I told him, I was refolved, if 
J could get but four or five men well armed to go with 
me, to go and deftroy that vile, abominable idol : to~ 
let them fee, that it had no power to help itfelf, 
and confequently could not be an cbjefl of worship, or 
to be prayed to, much lefs help them that offered facri- 
£ces to it. 

He laughed at me ; faid he. Your zeal may be good ; 
but what do yott propofe to yourfelf by it ? Propofe ! 
faid I, to vindicate the honour of God, which is in- 
fulted by this devil- worfhip. But how will it vindi- 
cate the honour of God ? faid he, while the people 
will not be able to know what you mean by it, unlefs 
you could fpeak to them too, and tell them fo ; and 
then they will fight you too, I will afTure you ; for 
they are defperate fellow^ « and that efjp^cially in de-^ 
fence of their idolatry. Can we not, (aid I, do it in 
the nifi^ht, and then leave them the reafons in writing, 
in their own language ? Writing ! faid he, why there 
is not in five nations of them, one man that knows any 
tiling of a letter, or how to read a word in anv langu- 
age, or ill their own. Wretched ignorance! faid I 
to him ; however, I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps 
nature may draw inferences from it to them, to let them 
fee how brutifh they are to.worfhip fuch horrid things. 
Lo k you. Sir, faid he, if your zeal prompts you to it fo 
warmly,' you muil do it; but, in the next place, I 
would have you confider thefe wild nations of people 
are fubjedled, by force, to the czar of Mufcovy's do-

TFu- , i confefs, put new thoughts into my head for

all that day I was uneafy to put my project in execu«- 
tion. Towards the evening the Stots merchant met 
me by accident in our walk about the to\^n> and de- 
fired to fpeak with me : I believe, faid he, I have put 
you off your good dcfign ; I have' been a little con- 
.cerned about it fince; fori abhor the idol and idola^ 
try as much as you can do. Truly, faid 1, you hav^ 
put it off a little as to the execution of it, but you have 
not put it all ouit of my thoughts ; and, I believe, I 
fliall do it ftill befefe4-qttir this place, though I were 
to be delivered up to them for fatisfa6lion.i No, no, 
faid he ; God forbid they fhould deliver you. up to fuch a 
crew of monfters I they Iball not do that neither ; 
.that would be murdering you indeed. Why, faid !> 
how would they ufe me? Ufe you 1 faid he ; Til tell 
you how they ferved a poor Ruffian, who affronted them 
in their worfliip jufl as you did, and whom they took 
prifoner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that 
he could not run away ; they took him and ilripped him 
ftark naked, and fet him upon the top of the idol mon- 
fler, and flood all round him, and fhot as many arrows 
into him as would flick over his whole body ; and then 
they burnt him and all the arrows flicking in him-, as a 
facrificc to the idol. And was this the fame idol ? 
faid I. Yes, faid he, the very fame. WelU faia I, 
J will tell you a flory : fo I related the (lory of cur men 
at Madagafcar, and how they burnt and facked tlie vil- > 
lage there, and killed man, woman, and child, for their 
murdering one of our men; jufl as it is related before ; 
and when I had done, I added, that I thought we ought 
to do fo to this village. 

He liflened Very attentively to the ilory ; but when 
I talked of doing fb to that village, faid he, you mif- 
take very much ; it was not this village, it was Mmofl 
a hundred miles from this place f but it was the fame

In awor^f, finding mc rcfolote, he liked the defign, 
and told me I fhould not go alone, but he would go 
with me ; but he would go firft, and bring a ftout fel- „ 
low, one of his countrymen, to go alfo with us ; and ^ 
one, faid he, as famous for his zeal as you can defife 
any one to be againft fuch devilifh things as thefe. In 
a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotfman, whom 
he caUed captain Richardfon ; and I gave him a full 
account of what I had feen, and alfo of what I intend- 
ed ; and he told me readily, he would go with me, if 
it coft him his life. So we agreed to go, only we three. 
I had, indeed, propofed it to my partner ; bat he de- 
clined it. He laid, he was ready to aflift me to the ut- 
moft, and upon all occafions, for my defence ; but that 
this was an adventure quite out of his way : fo, I fay, 
we refolved upon our work, only we three, and my 
man-fervant, and to put it in execution that night about 
midnight, with all the fecrecy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond thoughts, we were willing to 
delay it till the next night, becaufc the caravan being 
to fet forward in the morning, we fuppofed the governor 
could not pretend to give them any fatisfa^Uon upon us 
when we were out of his power ; the Scots merchant, 
as fteady in his refolution to e,nterpri7.e it, as bold in 
executing, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of fheep- 
Ikins, and a bonnes, with a bow and arrows, and had 
provided the fame for him.felf and his countryman, that 
the people, if they faw us, Ihould not be able to deter- 
mine who we were. 

All the firll night we fpent in mixing up fome, com- 
buflible matter with aqa-vitae, gunpowder, an<i fuch 
other materials as we could get ; and, having a good 
quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour after night 
we fet out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, 
and found that the people had not the leaft jealoufy of

we faw the three priefts, whom we miftook for butch- 
ero, we faw a light, and, going up clofe to the door, 
we heard people talking, as if there were five or fix 
of them ; we concluded therefore, that if we fet wild- 
fire to the idol, thefe men would come out immediate- 
ly, and run up to the place to refcue it from the de- 
flrudion that we intended for it : and what to do with 
them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying ic 
away, and fetting fire to it at a diflance ; but when 
we came to handle it, wc found it too bulky for our 
carriage ; fo we were at a lofs again. The fecond 
Scotfman was for fetting fire to the tent or hut, and 
knocking the creatures that were there on the head 
when they came out ; but I could not join with that ; 
I was againfl killing them, if it was impoflible to be 
avoided. Well then, faid the Scots merchant, I will 
tell you what we will do ; we will try to take them pri- 
foners, tie their hands, and make them ftand and iee 
their idol dellroyedv 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough 
about u^, which we ufed to tie our fire-works together 
with ; fo we refolved to attack thefe people firft, and 
with as little noife as we could. The firft thing we did, 
we knocked at the door, when oac of the prielts 
coming to it, we immediately feized upon him, flopped 
his mouth, and tied his hands behind him and led him to 
the idol, were we gagged him, that be might not make 
a noife ; tied his feet alfo together, and left him on the 
ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expedling that 
another would come out to fee what the matter was ; 
but we waited fo long till the third man came back to 
us ; and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again 
gently, and immediately out came two more, and we 
lerved them juft in the fame manner, but were obliged 
to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol 
fome diftance from one another ; when, going back, 
we found two more were come out to the door, -and

the other Scotchman and my man taking charge of the 
two men already bound, and tied together alio by the 
arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there, 
to fee if their idol would relieve them, making hafle 
back to us. 

When the Furze we had thrown in had filled the hut 
with fo much fmoke that they werealmoil fuffbcated, 
we then threw in a fmaU leather bag of another kind, 
which flamed like a candle, and, following it in, we 
found there were but four people left, who, it feems, 
were two men and two women, and, as we fuppofed, 
had been about fome of their diabolic facrifices. They 
appeared, in fhort, frighted to death, at leafl fo as to 
fit trembling and ilupid, and not able to (peak neither, 
for the fmoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the 
other, and all without any noife. J[ (hould have faid, 
we brought them out of the houfe. Or hut, firft ; for, 
indeed, we were not able to bear the fmoke any more 
than they were. When we had done this, we carried 
them altogether to the idol ; When we came there we 
fell to work with him ; and firft we daubed him all 
ever, and his robes alfo, with tar, and fuch other 
f uiFas we had, which was tallow mixed with brim- 
flone ; then we ftopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth 
full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a great 
piece^ of wildfire in his bonnet ; and then flicking 
all the combuftibles we had brought with us upon him, 
we looked about to fee if we could -find any thing elfe 
to help to burn him : when my Scotfroan remember- 
ed, that by the tent, or hut, where the men were, 
there lay a heap of dry forage, whether ftraw or ruflie^ 
I do not remember : away he and the other Scotfman 
ran, and fetched their arms full of that. When we had 
done this, we took all our prifoners^ and brought

mouths, and made them Hand up, and let them juH

We flayed by it a quarter of an liour, or thereabouts,

it burnt into a mere block or log of wood ; and then 
fetting the dry forage to it, we round it would be foon 
quite confumed, ^o we began to thinly of going away ; 
but the Scotfman faid : No, we muft not go ; for thtfe 
poor deluded wretches will all throw therafelves into the 
fire, and burn themfelves with the idol ; fo we refolved 
to flay till the forage was burnt down too, and then wo 
came away and left them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow tra-

nor rould any man fuggcft that we h^d been any-

But it did not end (b ; for the next day came a great

iage, but of an hundrea more, for aught I know^ td 
the town gates ; and, in a mofl outrageous manner, de* 
manded fatisfa^ion of the Rufikn governor, for the in* 
fulting their prieils, and burning their great Cham-

The governor, flill patient, and unwilling to make a 
breach, or to have any caufe of war alledged to be given 
by him, the czar having ftraightly charged him to treat 
the conquered country with gentlenefs and civility, gave 
them (till all the good words he could ; at laft he told 
them, there was a caravan gone towards Ruffia that 
morning, and, perhaps, it was fome of them who had 
done them, this injury ; and that, if they would be fa- 
tisfied with that, he would fend after them, to enquire 
into it. This Teemed to appleafe them a little ; and ac- 
cordingly the governor fent after us, and gave us a 
particular account how the thing was ; intimating with- 
al, that if any in our caravan had done it, they ihould 
make their efcape ; but thit, whether they had done it 
or no, we fhould make all the hade forward that was 
poffible ; and that in the mean time, he would keep them 
in play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. However^ 
ivhen it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew 
any thing of the matter ; and, as for us that were guilty, 
we were the leaft of all fufpedled ; none fo much as

but had Tuppofed we ihould have taken that fide of the 
lake, whereas we very happily took the fouth fide ; and 
in two days more we faw them not, for they, believing 
we were ftill before them, puftied on, till they came to 
the river Udda ; this is a very great river when it paffes 
farther north ; but when we came to it, we found it nar- 
row and fordable. 

The third day they either found their niiftake, Qr 
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, 
towards the dufk of the evening. We had, to our 
great fadsfa6lion, juftpitched upon a place for our camp 
which was very convenient for the night ; for as we 
were upon a defert, though but at the beginning of 
it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had 
no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expedled none but 
the city Jarawena, -which we had yet two days march 
to 5 the defert, however, had feme few woods in it on 
this fide, and little rivers, which ran all into the great 
river Udda. It was in a narrow ftreight between two 
fmall, but very thick woods, that we pitched our little 
camp for that night, expefting to be attacked in the 
night. 

Nobody knew but ourfelves what we were purfued 
for ; but as it was ufual for the Mogul Tartars to go 
about in troops in ihsLt defert, fo the caravans always 
fortify themfelves every night againft them, as againft 
armies of robbers ; and it was therefore no new thing to 
be purfued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our tra- 
vel^ a nioft advantageous camp ; for we lay between 
two woods, with a little rivulet running juft before. our 
front ; fo that we could not be furrounded or attacked 
any way, but in our front or rear ; we took care alfo to 
make our front as ftrong as we' coujd, by placing our 
packs, with our camels and horfes, all in a line on the 
infide of the river, and we felled fome trees in our 
rear.

faid» they would go away, and do us no farther harm» 
otherwife they would bum us all with fire. Our men 
looked Very blank at this meiTage, and began to flare 
at one another, to fee who looked with moft guilt in 
their faces, but, nobody was the word,\ nobody did it. 
The leader of the caravan fent word, he was well af- 
fured i^ was not done b) any of our camp ; that we 
were peaceable merchants travelling on our bufinefs ; 
that ^ e had done no harm to them, or to any one elfe ; 
and therefore they muft look farther for their enemies, 
who had injured them, for we were not the people ; (6 
dcfired them not to diilurb us ; for if they did, we fhould 
defend ourfelves. * 

They were far from being fatisfied with this for an 
anfwer, and a great crowd of them came down in the 
morning by break of day, to our camp ; but feeing 
us in fuch an advantageous fituation, they durfl come no 
farther than the brook in our front, where then 
flood, and fhewed us fuch a number, as, indeed, ter- 
rified us very much ; for thofe that fpoke leafl of them

at us a while, and then fetting up a great howl, they 
let fly a cloud of arrows aniong us ; but we were well 
enough fortified for that, for we wefe fheltered under 
our baggage ; and I do not remember that one man of 
us was hurt. 

Some tiihe after tHis, we faw them move a little to 
our right, and expe^ed them on the rear, when a, 
cunnine fellow, a Coffack as they call them, of Jara- 
wena, m the pay of the Mufcovites, calling to the leader 
of the caravan, faid to him, I will feiul all thefc people

Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka> with a caravan of 
mifcrcants> as he called them ; that is to fsy, thriftians; 
and that they- were refolved to burn the god Seal Karg, 
* belonging to the Tongufes. 

As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfedlly fpoke 
their language, he counterfeited fo well, that they all 
took it from him, and away they drove, in a moft vio- 
lent hurry, to Sibeilka, which it feems, was five days 
jsumey to the fouth, and in Tefs than three hours they 
were entirely out of our fight, and we never heard any- 
more of them, or ever knew whether they went to that 
other place called Sibeilka, or no. 

So we paifed fafely on to the City of Jarawcna, 
where there was a garrifon of Mufcovites ; and there we 
refted five days, the caravan being exceedingly fatigued 
with the laft day's march, and with want of reft in the 
liight. 

From this city we had a frightful defert, which held 
us^t^reeand twenty days march. We furnifhed our- 
felves with fome tents here, for the better accommodating 
ourfelves in the night ; and the leader of the caravan pro- 
cured fixteen carriages, or waggons, of the cauntry, for 
carrying our water and provifions ; and thefe carriages 
were our delencc every night round our little camp; fo 
that had the Tartars appeared, unlefs they had been 
very numerous indeed> they would not have been able 
to hurt us. 

We may well be foppofed to want refl again after 
this long journey ; for, in this defert, we faw neither 
houfe or tree, or fcarce a bufti ; we faw, indeed, abun- 
dance of the fable-hunters, as they call them ; thefe are 
ail Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which tMs country 
IS a part ; and they mquently attack fmall caravans : ' 
but we faw no numbers of them together. I was cu- 
rious to fee the fable-fkina they catched : but I could 
never fpeak with any of them ; for they durft not come

And thus the governor of Adinfkoy, whom I had an 
opportunity to make a viiit to, by means of the Scots 
merchant who was acquainted with him, offered U3 a 
guard of fifty men if we thought there was any danger, 
to the next flation. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe, we ihoujd find the country better peopled, 
and the people more civilized ; but I found myfelf mif- 
taken in both, for we had yet the nation of the Tonguefes 
to pafs through ; where we faw the fame tokens of pa- 
ganifm and barbarity, or worfe than before ; only as 
they were conquered by the Mufcovites, and entirely re- 
duced, they were not fo dangerous ; but for the rudenefs 
of manners, idolatry, and polytheifm, no people in the 
world everwent beyond them. They are clothed all in 
the fkins of beaHs, and their houfes are built of the 
fame. You know not a man from a woman, neither by 
die ruggednefs of their countenances, or their clothes ; 
and in the winter, when the ground is covered with 
fnow, they live under ground in houfes like vaults, 
which have cavities or caves going from one to ano- 
ther. 

If the Tarurs had their Cham Chi Thaungu for a 
whole village, or country, tbefe had idols in every hut, 
and every cave ; befides, they worfhip the ftars, the fun, 
the water, the fnow, and, in a word, every thing that 
they do not underftand, and they underiland but very 
little ; ^ that almoft every element, every uncommon 
thing, fets them a facrificing. 

But I am no more to defcribe people than countries^ 
any farther than mv ownjftory comes to be concerned in 
them. I met with nothing peculiajr to myCelf in all

of it being another defert, which took us np twelve 
days fevere travelling, without houfe, tree or buih ; but 
were obliged again to carry our own provifions, as well 
water as bread. After we were out of this defert, and 
had travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Muf- 
covite city er ilation, on the great river Janezay. This 
river, they told us, parted Europe from Afia, tho' our 
map-makers, as I am told, do not agree to it ; however, 
it is certainly the eaftern boundary of the antient Sibe- 
ria, which now makes a province only of the vail Muf- 
covite empire, but is itfeif equal in bignefs to the whole 
empire of Germany. 

And yet here I obferved ignorance and paganifm fHll 
prevailed, except in the Mufcovite garrifons ; all the 
country between the river Oby, and the river Janezay, 
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the 
remoteft of the Tartars, nay, as any nation, for aught I 
know, in Afia, or America. I alfo found, which I ob- 
ferved to the Mufcovite governors, whom I had oppor* 
t unity to converfe with, that the pagans are not much 
the wifer, or the nearer chriftianity , for being under the 
Mufcovite government ; which they acknowledged was 
true enough, but, they faid, it was none of their bufi* 
nefs ; that if the Czar expedied to convert his Siberian, 
or Tonguefe, or Tartar fubjeds, it fhould be done by 
fending clergymen among them, not foldiers ; and they 
added, with more iincedty than I expedted, that they 
found it was not fo much the concern of their monarch, 
to make the people chrifUahs, as it was to make them 
Culyedts. ' ' 

Trom this river, to the great river Oby, we croiTed a 
wild uncultivated country ; I cannot fay 'tis a barbarous 
foil ; 'tis only barren of people, and good manage- 
ment ; otherwife it is initfelf amoft pleafant, fruitfid* 
and agreeable country. What inhabitants we found in

I have nothing material to fay of my particular 
affairs, till I came to Toboliki, the capita] of Siberia,, 
where I continued fome time on the following occa* 
iion. 

We had been now almoft feven months on our jour- 
ney, and ivinter began to come on apace : whereupon 
my partner and I called a council about our particular 
affairs in which we found it proper, confidering that 
we were bound for England, and not for Mofcow, to 
confider how to difpofe of ourfelves. They told us of 
fledges and rein-deer to carry us over the fnow in die 
'winter-time : and, indeed, they have fuch things, as it 
would be incredible to relate the particulars of, by 
which means the Ruffians travel more in the winter than 
they can infummer ; becaufe in theie fledges they are 
able to run night and day : the fnow being frozen, is 
one univerfal covering to nature, by which the hills, 
the vales « the rivers, the lakes, are all fmooth, and 
hard as a ^one ; and they run upon the furface, without 
any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occafion to pufh at a winter journey q^ 
this kind : I was bound to England^ not ta Mofcow, 
and my route two ways : either I mull go on as the ca- 
ravan went, till I came to Janflaw,. and then go off 
weft for Narva, and the gulph of Finland, and fo eithef 
by Tea or land to Dantzick, where I might poffibly fell 
my China cargo to good advantager or I muft leave the 
caravan at a Tittle town on the Dwina, from whence 
I had but fix days by water to Arch- Angel, and from 
thence might be fure of (hipping, either to England » 
iioUbmd, or Hannburgh. 

Now to go any of thefe joumies in the winter 
would have been prepoilerous : for as to Dantadck,. the 
fialdck would be frozen op, and I could not get paf* 
fage : and to go by lana in thofe countries, was far 
leis fafe than among the Mogul Tartars : likewife to 
Arch- Angel, in Odober all the fliipt would br gone 
from thence^ and even the merchants, who ^eU

city of proviJ!ions> and muft He there in an empty town 
all the winter ; fo that, upon the whole, T thought it 
mnch my better way to let the caravan go, and to make 
proyiiion to winter where I was, viz. at Toboliki, in 
Siberia, in the latitude of fixty degrees, where I was 
fare of three things to wear out a cold winter with, 
viz. plenty of provifions, fuch as the country aiForded, 
a warm hoofe, with fuel enough, and excellent com- 
pany ; of all which I fhall give a full account in its 
place. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my be- 
loved ifland, where I never fek cold, except when I 
had my ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do tp 
bear my clothes on my back, and never made any 
fire hviX without doors, and my neceflity, in dreff- 
ing m/ food, &c. Now I made me three good veils, 
with large robes or gowns over them to hang down 
to the feet, and button clofe to the wriils, and all 
thefe lined with furs, to make them' /Efficiently 
warm. 

As to^-a- tvarm honfe, I muft confefs, I greatly dif- 
like our way in ^n^^land, of making fires in every 
room in the hou^e, m open chimneys, which, when 
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold 
as the climate. But taking an apartment in a good 
houfe in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built 
like a furnac'fe, in the centre of fix feveral rooms, like 
a'ftove ; the funnel to carry the fmoke Went up one 
way, the door to come at the fire went in ano- 
ther, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, 
but no fire feen ; like as they heat the bagnios in Eng- 
land, f 

By this means we had always the fame climate in all 

the rooms, and an equal heat was preferved ; and how 

cold foever it was without, it was always warm within ; 

and yet we faw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with 

. any fmoke. 

The moH wonderful thing of all was, that it (hould 
be poiTible to meet with good company here, in a coun- 
try fo barbarous as that of the mod aortherly ^arts of

foldiery, and courtiers ofMufcovy. Here were the fa- 
mous Prince Galilf ken, or Galofflvcn, andhisfon, the

By means of my Scots HKrchant, whom, neverthe-

with fcveral of thcfc gentlemen, and fome of them 
of the firft rank ; and from thefe, in the long winter- 
nights in which I flayed here, I received feveral 
agreeable vifits. It was talking one night with a cer- 
tkm prince, one of the banifhed minifters of ftate be- 
longmg to the Czar ofMufcovy, that my talk of my 
particular cafe began. He had been telling me abun- 
dance of fine things, of the greatnefs, the magnifi- 
cence, and dominions, and the abfolute power of 
the emperors of the Ruffianb. I interrupted him, and 
told him, I was a greater and more powerful prince 
than ever the Czar of Mufcovy was, though my domi- 
nions were not fo large, or my people fo many. The 
Ruffian Grandee looked a l»ttle furprifed, and fixing 
his eyes fleadily upon me, began to wonder what I 
meant. 

I told him his wonder would ceafe when I had ex- 
plained myfelf. Firft, I told him, I had the abfolute 
difpofal of the lives and fortunes of all my fubjedts: 
that notwithftandine my abfolute power, I had not 
one perfon difaffecled to my government or to my 
perfon, in all my dominions. He fhook his head at 
that, andfaid. There, indeed, I outdid the Czar cf 
Mufcovy. I told him, that all the lands in my king- 
dom were my own, and all my fubjedls were not only 
my tenants, but tenants at will; that they would all 
fight for me to the laft drop ; and that never tyrant, 
for fuch 1 acknpwledged myfelf to be, was ever fo uni-

the ftory at large of my living in the ifland, and how 
I managed both myfelf and the people there that were 
under me, juft as I have iince minuted it down. They 
were exceedingly taken with the ftory, and efpecially 
the prince, who told me with a figh, that the true 
greatnefs of life was to be mailer of ourfelves ; that 
he would not have exchanged iuch a (late of life as 
mine, to have been Czar of Mufcovy ; and that he found 
more felicity in the retirement he feemed to be banifh- 
cd to there, than ever he found in the higjell autho- 
rity he enjoyed in the court of his mafter the Czar : that 
the height ofTSfhuman wifdom was to bring our tern* 
pers down to our circumflances, and to make a calm 
within, under the weight of the greateft ftorm with- 
out. When he came firft hither, he faid, he ufed 
to tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from 
his back,, as others had done before him ; but a little 
time and' coniideration had made him look into him- 
fclf, . as well as round himfelf, to things without : 
that he found the mind of man, if it was but once 
brought to refleft upon the ftate of univerfal life, and 
how little this world was concerned in its true feli-

itfelf, fully fatisfying to itfelf, and fuitable to its own

from the world ; that air to breathe in, food to fuf-

ed abroad all weathers, frequently brought us in frefh 
venifon, very fat and good : and fometimes bears flefh, 
but we did not much care for the lafl. We had a good 
ftock of tea, with which we treated our friends as above f 
and, in a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all 
things confidered.

ROBINSON CRUSOE* 263 

It was now March* and the days grown* conilder- 
ably longer* and the weather at lead tolerable ; fo 
other travellers began to prepare fledges to carry them 
over the fnow, and to get things ready to be going ; 
but my meafures being fixed, as I have faid, for Arch- 
Angel, and not for Mufcovy or the Baltic* I made 
no motion, knowing very well, that the fhips from the 
fouth do not fet out for that part of the world till 
May or June : and that if I was there at the beginning 
of Auguft, it would be as foon as any fhips would-be 
ready to go away ; and therefore, I fay, I made no 
hafte to be gone, as others did ? in a word, I faw a 
great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away 
before me. It feems, every year they go from thence 
to Mufcow for trade , viz. to carry furs, and buy 
neceffaries with them, which they bring back to fur- 
nifh their lb ops ; aHb others went on the fame errand 
to Arch- Angel ; but then they alfo, being to come 
'back again above eight hundred miles, went oat all 
before me. 

In (hort,- about the latter end of ^ay, I began to 
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, it 
occurred to me, that feeing all thefe people were ba- 
nifhed by the Czar of Mufcovy to Siberia, and yet, 
when they came there, were at liberty to go wliither 
they would ; why did they not then go away to any 
part of the world whereevcr they thought fit ? and I be- 
gan to examine what fhould hinder them from making 
fuchan attempt. 

- 5ut my wonder was over, when I entered upon 
that fubjeft with the perfon I have mentioned, who 
anfwered me thus : Confider, firfl, fir, faid he, the 
place where we are ; and, fecondly, the condition we 
are in ; efpecially, faid he, the generality of the people 
who are banifhed hither. We are furrounded, faid he, 
with ilronger things than bars and bolts ; on the 
north fide is an unnavigable ocean, where fhip never 
failed, and boat never fwam ; neither, if we had both, 
could we know whither to go with them. Every other 
way, faid he, we have a^)ove a thoufand miles to pafs 
through the Czar's own doin\tdati%, «cAVs^ N^^^\^^^T

If I was 'fiirf^rUed bdbre» I was -qatte dumb noK 
and Aood iilem, looking at him ; and, indeed, admiK 
what 1 faw ; the ftraggie in his fou} was (b great, tha 
though the weather was extrenely cold, it pat him m 
a moll violent fweat, and I found he wanted to g{\t 
vent to his mind } fo I faid a word or two, that I wouk 
leave him to coniider of it, and wait on him again ^ ad 
then I withdrew to my own apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard fomebody at or nea; 
the door of the room, and I was going to open the door ; 
but he had q>ened it, and come in : My dear friend, 
faid he, you hadaloiofl overfet me, but I am recovered: 
do not take it ill tliat 1 do not cioie with yoor offer ; t. 
aflure yoo, it is not for want of a fenfe of the kindoeli 
of it in ycm ; and I come to make the moft iincere ac- 
knowledgment of it to you ; but, 1 hope, I have got 
the viftory over myielf. 

M}^ lord, faid I, I hope you are fully fatls^edr th^ 

)U did not reiift the call of heaven. Sir, faid he, if it 
ad been from heaven, the fame power would have in 
fiuenced me to accept it ; but, I hope, and am fully 
fatisiied, that it is from heaven that I decline it ; and 
I have an infinite iaus£i£tion in the parting, ihzt yon 
ihall leave me an honeil man ilill, thpngh not a free 
man. 

I had nothing to do but to acquiefce, and aiake pro 
f eifion to him of my having no end in it, but a ^ucere 
defire to fcrve htm. He- embraced me very pafiion* 
ately, and aiTored me, he was fenfible of that, ami 
Ihould always acknowledge it ^ and with that he offered 
me a very fine prefent of fables, too mnch, indeedj 
for xne to accq)t from a man in his ciscamibinces ; an( 
1 would have avoided then, but he would not be re- 
fufed. 

The n xt morning I fent my fervant to his lord 
ihp, wit afmali prefent of tea, tMro pieces of Chini 
damafk, and four little wedges of Japan goId> whici 
did not all weigh above fix ounces, or thereabouts ; bii 
were far ihort of the value of his iablcis, which, inr 
deed, whea i came to England, £ found- worth near ti^c 
Ixundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one plect

had a fine ibirop upon.it, of the Japan coinage, which. 
I-found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take 
any more ; and fent word by my fervant, that he de- 
Sred to fpeak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew- what 
had pafTed between us, and hoped I would -not move 
him any more in that affair^ but that-, fince I made 
fuch a generous offer to him, he aflced me, if I had 
kindnefs enough to offer the fame to another perlbn- 
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great 
ihare of concern. I told him, that I could not lay I 
inclined to do fo much for any one but himfelf, for 
whom I had a particular value, and fliould have been 
glaa to have been the inftrument of his deliverance ; 
however, if he would pleafe to name the perfon. to me,. 
1 would give him. my anfwer, and hoped he would. ^ 
not be difpleafed with me, if he was with my anfwer. 
He told me, it was only his fon, who, though I had 
not feen, yet was in the fame condition with himfelf, 
and above two hundred miles from him, on the other 
fide the Oby i but that, if I confented, he would fend 
for him. 

I made no hefitation,. but told him I would do it i. 
I made fome ceremony in letting him undenland, that' 
it was wholly on his account ; and that feeing I could not 
prevail on him> 1 would (hew my refpedl to him, by* 
my concern for his fon : but thefe things are too te-^ 
dious to repeat here. He fent away the next day for 
his fon, and in about twenty da\s he came back witb 
die meffengcr, bringing fix or feven horfes loaded with 
very rich, furs, -ind which,, in the whole, amountedto- 
a very great value. 

His fervants brought the horfes into the town, but 
Uft the young lord at a diilance till night, when he 
came incognito into our apartment, and his father pre- 
fented him to me ; and, in fhort> we concerted there 
the manner of our travelling, and every thing proper 
for the journey. 

I had bought a confiderable quantity of fables, black 
fox-fkins, fine crmins, and {\xcVi c^tx W% "^^^sx -^x^

the greateft part here ; and the reft afterwards at Arch-

Loudon ; and ftiy partner, who wjis fenfible of the pro- 
fit, and whofe' bufinefs more particularly than mine, 
was merchandize, was mip,hti}y pkafed with our Itay, 
on account of the traffic we made here. . 

It was in the^beginning of June, when I left this rc- 
iBOte place, a city, } believe, little heard of in the 
woild ; and, indeed, it is fo far out of the road of com- 
merce, that I know toot how it (hould be much talked 
of. We were now come to a very fmall caravan, being 
only thirty-two horfes and camels in all, and all of 
them pafTed for mine, though my new gueft was pro- 
prietor cf eleven of them. It was molt natural alfo, 
that I (hould take more fervants with me than I had be- 
fore, and the young lord paffed for my ilc.ward ; what 
great man I paffed for myfelf I know not, neither did \ 
It concern me to enqifire. We had here the worft and 
the largeft defext to pafs over that we met with in all 
the journey, indeed, I call it the worft, becaufc the 
Way was very deep in fome place?, and very uneven 
in others ; the beft we had tb fay for it, was, that we 
thought we had no troops of Tartars and* robbers to 
fear, and that they never came on this fide the river 
Oby, or at^leaft but very, feldom ; but we found it 
otherwife. 

. My young lord had with him a faithful Mufccv»tc 
fervant, or rather a Siberian fervant, who was per- 
fedly acquainted with the country ; and who led us 
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the 
principal towns and cities upon the great road, fuch 
as Tumen, Soloy-Kamofkoy, and feveral others ; be- 
caufe the Mufcovite garrifons which are kept there are 
veiy curious and ftrift in their obfervations upon travel- 
lers, and fearching left any of the baniftied j5erfons of 
note fhould make their efcape that w^y^into Mufcovy ; 
but by this means, as we were kept otit of the cities,

^is the young lord was fo ibnii ble of, that he would 
not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to fcveral 
cities on the way > but lay abroad hinilelf, with his 
(ervant, in the woods, and met us always at the ap- 
pointed places. 

We were jull entered Europe, having pafTed the river 
Kama, which, in thofe parts, is. the boundary between 
Europe and Afia; and the firflcity en the European fide 
wag. called Soloy-Kamc&oy, which is as much as to fay, 
the great city oa the river Kama ; and here we thought 
to have feen fome evident alteration in the people, their 
manners,- their habit, their religion, and their bufi- 
pefs ; but we were miflaken ; for as we had a vaft dc- 
iert to pafs, which, by relation, is near feven hundred 
miles lolig in feme places,, but not above two hundred 
miles over where we pafled it ; fo, till we came pafl 
that horrible place, we found very little difference be- 
tween that country and the Mogul Tartary 5 the people 
HioiUy Pagans, and little better than the favages of 
America ;. their houfcs and towns full of idols, and 
their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities 
as above, and the villages near them ; where they 
are Chriftians, as they call themfelves of the Greek 
church 5 but even thefe have their religion mingled 
with fo mapy reliques of fuperftition, that it is fcarce 
to be known, in fome places for mere forcery and 
witchrrafL 

In pafling ^his forefl, I thought, indeed, we mufl, 
. after all ou/ dangers were, in our imagination, efcaped> 
as before, have been plundered and robbed, and per- 
haps murdered by a troop of thieves ; of what coun- 
try they were, whether the roving bands of the OIHachi^ 
a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the banks of 
the Oby, had ranged thus far ; or whether they were 
the feble Jjtmters of Siberia, I am yet at a lofs to 
know ; but they were all on horfeback, carried bows 
and arrows>. and were at firft about five and forty in 
number ; they came fo near to us, as within about. 
two mufquet Ihot ;. and, afldng no queftions, they fur- 
rounded us^vith their horfe, and looked v6ry earneftly

before par camels being noflbove fixteen men in all ; 
and bein^ drawn up thus, we halted, and fent out the 
Siberian lervant, who attended his lord, to fee who they 
were ; his mailer was the more willing to let him go, 
becaufe he was not a little apprehenfive that they were 
a Siberia troop fent out after him. The man came up 
near them with a flag of truce, and called to them ; 
but though he fpokeleveral of their languages, or dia- 
lers of languages rather, he could not UAder(lan4 a 
word they faid ; however, after fome figns to him not 
to come nearer to them at his peril ; fo he faid he un- 
derftood them to mean, offering to ihoot at him if ht 
advanced ; the fellow came back no wiler than he wfent, 
only that by their drefs, he faid, he believed them to be 
fome Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circaflian hords ; 
and that there muft be more of them on the great defert, 
though he never heard that ever any of them were feen 
4b far north before. ' 

This was fmall comfort to us ; however, we h^d no 
remedy : there was on our left hand, at about a 
quarter of a mile*s diftance, a little grove or clump 
of trees, which flood clofe together, and very near 
the road; I immediately refolved we would advance 
to thofe trees, and fortify ourfelves as well as we 
€ould there ; for, firll, I conlidered that the trees would 
in a great meafure cover us from their arrows ; and, in 
the next place, they could not come to charge ps in a 
body : it was, indeed, my oltl Portoguefe pilot who 
propofed it : and who had this excellency attending^ 
nim, namely, that he was always readied and moil apt 
to diredl and encourage us in cafes of the moHdati- 
ger. ^^e advanced imtnediately with what fpeed we 
could, and gained that little wood, the Tartars or 
thieves, for we knew not what to tall them, keep- 
ing their fland, and riot attempting to hmder us. 
When we came thither, we found, to our great fatis- 
faftion, that it was a fwampy fpringy piece of ground, 
and, on the other fide, a very ^r eat fpring of water, 
which,' running out in a little rill or brook, was a 
little farther joined by another of the like bignefs : and.

that as foon as We got in, we faw ,ourfelves perfc6lly

Bat to make this more difHcult, our Portogueie> witK 
indefatigable applicati9n9. cut down great arms of the 
trees, and kid theixr hanging, not cut quite off, from 
one tree to another ; fo that he made a continued fence 
almoft round us. 

We flaid here, waiting the motion of the cnemy^ 
fome hours, without perceiving they madf any offer to 
iVir ; when about two hours before night, they came 
down direflly upon us ; and, though we had not per- 
ceived it, we found they had been joined by fome more 
of the fame; fo that they were near fourfcore horfe^ 
whereof, however, we fancied fome were women. 
They came on till they were within half a fhot of our 
little wood, when we fired one mufquet without ball,, 
and called to them in the Ruffian tongue, to know what 
they wanted, and bid them keep oS*; but, as if they 
knew nothing of what we faid, they came on with a 
double fury diredtly up to the wood-fide, not imagining 
we were fo barricadoed, that they could npt break in ; 
our old pilot was our captain, as well as he had beeii< 
our engineer ; and defired of us, not to fire upon them 
till they came within piftol-fhot, that we might be Aire 
to kill ; and that when we did fire we fhould be fure.- 
to take good aim. We bade him give the word of com* 
mand ; which he delayed fo long, that they were, fome 
of thern^ within two pikes length of us when we- 
fired. ' 

We aimed fo true (or Providence dircded our-fhot fa 
fure) that we killed fourteen of them at the firft volley, , 
and wounded feveral others, as alfo feveral of their 
horfes ; for we had all of us loaded, our pieces with two . 
I or three bullets a piece at leafl* 

They were terribly furprifed with our fire, and re-- 
treated immediately about one hundred rod* from us ;^ 
in which time ^ we loaded our pieees again,. and, feeing 
them keep that diflance, we fallied out, and caught 
fouf or five of their horfes, w^iofc riders, we fup*

could eafily perceive they were Tartars,, but knew not 
from what country, or how they came to make an excur*

About an hour after, they made a motion to attack 
«s agsun, and rode round our little .woody to fee where 
elfe they might breaking but finding us always ready 
to face them, they went off* again, and we refolve^not 
to ^r from the place for that night. 

We ilept a little, you may be f ure ; but fpent the mo^ 
pari of the night in flrengthening our fituation, and 
barricadoing ffie entrances into the wood ; and, keeping 
a flrid wacc-.j, we waited for day-light, and, when it 
came, it gave us a very unwelcome difcovery indeed ; 
for the enemy, who we thought were difcouraged with 
the reception they had met with, were now increafed t» 
no lefs than three hundred, and had fet up eleven or 
twelve huts and tents, as if they were refolved to befiege 
us ; and this little camp they had pitched, was upon the 
open plain, at about three quarters of a mile from us* 
We were, indeed, furprifed at this difcovery ; and now, 
I confefs, I gave myfelf over for loft, and all that I had* 
The lofs of my efFeds did not lie fo near me (though

for my partner, he was raging ; he declared, that to 
lofe his goods would be his ruin ; and he would rather 
die than be ftarved ; and he was for fighting t;o the lail

brought from Tobolfki> if there was noother^ or more 
private ways, by which we might avoid then in the 
night, and, perhaps either retreat to fome town, or get 
help to guard us over the defert. 

The Siberian, who was fervant to the yoting lord^ 
told u**, if we defigned to avoid them, and not fight,, 
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a way 
that went north towards the river Petraz, by which he 
made no doubt but we might get away, and the Tar- 
tars never the wifer ; but he faid, his Jord had told 
him he would not return, but would rather chufe to fighu 
I told him, he miftook his lord ^ for that he was^ toa 
wife a man..to love fighting for the fake of iti that I 
knew his lord was brave enough by what he had fliewed 
already ; but that his lord knew better, than to defire 
to have feventeen or eighte€n men fight five hundred^ 
unleA an unavoidable neeeflity< forced th«m.toit ; and 
that if he thought it poflible for us to efcape in tfie 
night, we had nothing elfe to 4o but to attempt it. He : 
anfwered> if his lord gave him fuch order, he would lofc; 
his life if he did not perform it. We foon brought his 
lord to give that order, though privately, and we im- 
mediately prepared for the putting it in pradice. 

And firft, as (oon as it began to be dark, we kindled 
a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and . 
prepared fo as to make it burn all night, that the Tar- 
tars might conclude we were iHU there ; but, as foon as 
it- was dark, that is to fay, fo as we could fee the ftars, 
(^* our guide would not ftir before) having all our 
horfes and camels ready loaden, we followed our new 
guide, who, I foon found, fleered himfelf by the pole» 
or. north flar, all the country being, level for a long 
way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began 
to be lighter ilill, not that it was quite dark all nighty

ther lighter than we wiihed it to be : but by fix o'clock

and travelled till eight the next mornmg, though not 
quite fo haftily as before ; and about feven o'clock we 
paiTed a little river, called Kirtxa, aad came to a good 
large town inhabited by Ruffians, and very populous, 
called Ozemys ; there we heard, thatfeveral troops or 
hords of Calmucks had been abroad upon the defert> 
but that we were now completely out of danger of them ^ 
which was to our great fatisfadtion,. you may be fure. 
Here we were obliged to get fome frefh horfes, and, 
having need enough of rcflf, we ftaid five days ; and my 
partner and I agreed to-give the honeft Siberian, who 
brought us thither, the value often piUoles for his con- 
dufHng us. >• 

In five days more we came to Veuffima, upon the ' 
river Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina,. 
we were there very happily near the end of our travels 
by. land, that river being navigable in feven days paT- 
fage to Archangel: from hence we came to Law- 
renfkoy, where the river joins, the third of July : and 
provided ourfelves with two luggage-boats, and a barge, 
for our convenience : wc embarlccd the feventh, and 
arrived all fafe at Archangel the eighteenth, having 
been a year, five months, and three days, on the jour- 
ney, including our Hay of eight mon&lis and odd days- 
at Tobolflci. 

. We were obliged to ftay at this place fix weeks for 
the arrival ®f the (hips, and muft have tarried longer, 
had not a Hamburgher come in above a month fooner 
than any of the EngUih (hips : when, after fome corni- 
deration, that the city of Hamburgh might happen to 
be as good a market for our goods a? London, we all 
took freight with him : and having put ^ur goods en 
board, it was moft natural for me to put my lleward on- 
board to take care of them : by which means my young 
lord had a^ fufficient opportunity to conceal himfelf, 
never coming on (bore again, in all the time we ftaid 
there : and this he did, that he might not be feen in the 
city, where fome of the Mofcow mercha nts would cer*
